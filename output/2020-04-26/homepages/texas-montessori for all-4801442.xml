    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <div class="page_content">
<p><b>Allen Montessori Academy </b>was established in <b>1982</b> and it was the first, original Montessori school in Allen, Texas. </p>  <p>Our mission is to offer a warm, loving, high quality, year-round education to children 6 weeks to age 6 years old.</p>  <p>We are a school that awakens children's imaginations to the limitless possibilities in life, and a community in which children and adults find friendships and support. As the first formal educational experience for our students, our program is designed to provide a lasting foundation of skills and positive attitudes to support a lifetime of learning.</p>  <p>At our school, everyone is encouraged to ask questions and broaden their understandings of themselves, others, and the world around them. We incorporate the values and methodology developed by <b>Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952)</b>. Our classrooms are structured to address each child's individual needs, strengths and passions.</p>  <p>Success in our school is directly related to our Montessori certified, dedicated teachers, (some of whom have been with Allen Montessori Academy for over 12 years, others more than 6) and the belief in which children develop of themselves as capable, self-directed, and independent. Dr. Maria Montessori developed her specialized, hands-on curriculum methods over a century ago based on years of observing children learning. Each classroom environment contains a wide range of materials that attract the child’s interest and present concepts in a carefully sequenced order, under the watchful guidance of Montessori-prepared teachers.</p>

        My son has attended Allen Montessori Academy for 2 years. He began in the baby room and just completed another year in the toddler room with Miss Grace. It has been a fantastic experience in every way. I am a teacher myself and very picky. I chose AMA because of the teachers and feel of the school. It feels like family. This last year, my son learned by leaps and bounds. My family can not believe his skills and knowledge base. He loves going to "his school". He just turned 3 and is beginning to read. They have an activity room and our favorite, the library. Every day when we leave, he looks forward to taking a book and in the morning when we arrive, he puts it back. Even the teachers from other classes know us and he is so well loved and cared for. As a parent who had a hard time going bac...        </div>

        My grandson (who lives with me) has been attending since he was 4 months old (now almost age 4.5 yrs). AMA has dedicated, caring, nuturing and competent staffers. We could not be more pleased with the school. Highly recommend as we have complete ease of mind and confidence in the care he receives.        </div>

        My daughter went to Allen Montessori Academy and my son still attends this school. Trust me, this is no daycare. It is a school. My daughter moved to kindergarten (Allen ISD) and from day one she was already ahead of her class in most respects (math, art, reading, writing, behaviour, etc...) There is no doubt in my mind that Allen Montessori's education has a great deal to do with her achievements. Already, my son also seems very advanced when compared to other kids in my daughter's kindergarten class, and he still has 2 years before going to kinder! I am very comfortable with the teachers and staff: they are wonderful! Not only on academics, but also in helping educating your kids with good manners, proper eating habits, proper language skills, etc, etc... They also make the morning drop-...        </div>

        My child has been going to AMA for 2 years now and we are very happy with the management, staff, curriculum, lunch program, all the enrichment programs. The management keeps in touch with all the parents through e-mails, newsletters, calendars. My child is learning so much academically as well as manners. We love the school and highly recommend it!        </div>

        My first child joined 7 years ago, then my second one and now my third one is enrolled in this school. The school may not be very fancy but its most important asset is its staff. The dedication and concern of its teachers for my child's learning are phenomenal. All teachers are certified and highly experienced. I highly recommend this school to all parents. Before joining this school, I enrolled my first child in a very fancy school. I tried that school for a whole one year and finally with lot of disappointment, I pulled her out and enrolled in Allen Montessori and since then I never thought of any other school. My youngest one looks forward to go to school everyday and she loves her teachers. The parent-teacher communication is also remarkable.        </div>
