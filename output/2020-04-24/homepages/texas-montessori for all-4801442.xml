    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <div class="page_content">
<p><b>Allen Montessori Academy </b>was established in <b>1982</b> and it was the first, original Montessori school in Allen, Texas. </p>  <p>Our mission is to offer a warm, loving, high quality, year-round education to children 6 weeks to age 6 years old.</p>  <p>We are a school that awakens children's imaginations to the limitless possibilities in life, and a community in which children and adults find friendships and support. As the first formal educational experience for our students, our program is designed to provide a lasting foundation of skills and positive attitudes to support a lifetime of learning.</p>  <p>At our school, everyone is encouraged to ask questions and broaden their understandings of themselves, others, and the world around them. We incorporate the values and methodology developed by <b>Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952)</b>. Our classrooms are structured to address each child's individual needs, strengths and passions.</p>  <p>Success in our school is directly related to our Montessori certified, dedicated teachers, (some of whom have been with Allen Montessori Academy for over 12 years, others more than 6) and the belief in which children develop of themselves as capable, self-directed, and independent. Dr. Maria Montessori developed her specialized, hands-on curriculum methods over a century ago based on years of observing children learning. Each classroom environment contains a wide range of materials that attract the child’s interest and present concepts in a carefully sequenced order, under the watchful guidance of Montessori-prepared teachers.</p>

        Both my sons have attended Allen Montessori on and off during the past 8 years. Both of them started reading before the age of 4 and are both very astute in Math. I attribute everything to the way they were taught at Allen Montessori. The academic rigor is second to none. Ms. Tehmina has been a God-send to our family. My older son is now a straight A student at Norton and is in the AIM (Talented and GIfted) program. His study skills have been honed so well during his 4-year stay at this school. We have kept our younger son at AMA for kindergarten for the sole purpose of further advancing his academic skills. I highly recommend this school for both its academic and family-oriented environment. Do come by for a visit so you can experience for yourself what other Montessori schools can not of...        </div>

        Our son has been with AMA for more than a year, and he has improved a lot, especially when he has the new teacher - Ms Celene Nova - he gets along really well with her. She has a great personality, with her experience and dedication, she knows how to manage a strong-character toddler like our son :). The Management really supports us too. Ms Nazmun is also a really nice teacher that we feel thankful that our son has them as his teachers.        </div>

        I have two daughters, both of which have attended Allen Montessori Academy. We visited just about every major and some in-home childcare facilities before we settled on AMA. There was a night and day difference between AMA and the others. It was clear to us on our first visit that the educators at AMA were passionate about montessori teachings and practices and were not simply there to provide daycare. If you value education and are looking for a place to help your child learn both practical life and academically, AMA is that GREAT place.        </div>

        My first child joined 7 years ago, then my second one and now my third one is enrolled in this school. The school may not be very fancy but its most important asset is its staff. The dedication and concern of its teachers for my child's learning are phenomenal. All teachers are certified and highly experienced. I highly recommend this school to all parents. Before joining this school, I enrolled my first child in a very fancy school. I tried that school for a whole one year and finally with lot of disappointment, I pulled her out and enrolled in Allen Montessori and since then I never thought of any other school. My youngest one looks forward to go to school everyday and she loves her teachers. The parent-teacher communication is also remarkable.        </div>
                <div style="display:none">
        I have volunteered at AMA during past summer months and the one thing that puts it far and above other schools is the teaching staff. The teachers here do focus on providing the best Montessori education, and thus laying a sound foundation that will help them in their future educational careers. However, they go past just laying an educational foundation, but help to shape and mold the character of their students. The students learn to respect others, themselves, and their education. They learn valuable life skills that sometimes get overlooked, but that will probably help them more.        </div>
