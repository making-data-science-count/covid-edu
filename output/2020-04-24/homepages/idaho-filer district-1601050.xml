Please see linked document for more information. The Filer School District Board of Trustees has not approved a plan for re-opening at this time.</p>

<p>Please see the linked document for <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_iPgLSdZEYk-PE1Rle8qfSIrPKqXKTOGfZuNza5T39s/edit?usp=sharing">Special Education Information</a></strong> during the school closure.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus and School Closure Update</h2>

<p class="note">Updated April 7, 2020</p>

<p>Key Updates include the following: School Closure Date, Zoom, Graduation and Graduation Requirements, Chromebook Repair, Internet Access, etc</p>

<p>We are now into week two of online learning. Most things are going well, however we have
found out our procedures that need to be changed. We appreciate your patience as we make
those adjustments.</p>

<p>Zoom privacy is one of the potential issues with online learning. Teachers have been
instructed how to assure any meetings using this tool are private and only students are allowed
into the sessions.</p>

<p>Events continue to change rapidly and we will continue to make adjustments as the situation
changes and update you as soon as possible. Updates will come both from the District as a
whole and from individual schools as what works for one school may not work in the same
manner for another school.</p>

<p>As schools closed to move to online learning Governor Little called for “compassion in a time of
uncertainty” I shared before and it is worth sharing again, We are fortunate to live in Filer and
the communities that make up the Filer School District. These communities take care of their
neighbors. Continue to check on your neighbors. Reach out to your worship communities and if
you live in Filer you can contact cityclerk@cityoffiler.com to request support for someone in
need. Also contact the District or any building if you have food or other needs.</p>

<p>The following information will provide you with specific details:</p>

<p><strong>SCHOOL CLOSURE</strong></p>

<p>STATE BOARD ANNOUNCED CONTINUED SCHOOL CLOSURE UNTIL THE END
OF YEAR OR APPROVAL BY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD TO REOPEN SCHOOL IF
REQUIREMENTS TO BE ESTABLISHED BY STATE BOARD HAVE BEEN MET. 
The State Board of Education, due to the Coronavirus health concerns, has closed all Idaho
schools until the end of the scheduled school year. The State Board has provided local school
boards with the option to have students return to school if the social distancing requirement has
been lifted and the health requirements in the community have been met.</p>

<p><strong>To reopen school is only an option for the local school board,
it not a requirement.</strong></p>

<p>The State Board is working with state health officials to determine those requirements. Updates
will be available through text messages, email, the district website, and KMVT news.</p>

<p><strong>ONLINE LEARNING TARGET 4HR PER DAY:</strong></p>

<p>The Filer School District Staff developed plans to provide online learning which include
lessons and activities that would take approximately four hours a day to complete. Times
will vary based on each student.</p>

<p>Staff email addresses are available on our website. Voicemails will only be checked
intermittently, so the best way to reach district administration and building principals is by e-
mail. Principals at their building shared the details of their individual building plans. They will
continue to share building changes and if needed teachers will share individual class changes.</p>

<p><strong>GRADUATION CEREMONY</strong></p>
<p>The administration is working in conjunction with the senior class leadership and senior parents to
organize a graduation ceremony. They are committed to creating an opportunity for the class of 2020 to
celebrate their graduation success. The primary focus will be on creating a safe event that all can be a
part of. As soon as plans are created they will be shared with you. Jake Lee from Idaho Graduation
Sales will be shipping caps and gowns directly to seniors, instead of delivering them to the school for
pickup. If you need assistance with a cap and gown please email Mr. Lee at sales@idgrad.com</p>


<p><strong>GRADUATION REQUIREMENT CHANGES:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>College Entrance Exams waived by State Board if students are not able to take the SAT</li>
<li>Senior Project waived by State Board if students are not provided the opportunity to complete</li>
<li>ISAT Tests grades 3-8 and high school waived by State Board for the 2019 - 2020 school year</li>
<li>Civic exams waived by State Board if students are not able to take exam or
alternative assignment</li>
<li>Semester Hours Requirement for credit waived by State Board if provided the
opportunity to complete the necessary hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the State Board waived the above requirements, they did so only to assure all seniors
are able to graduate this year.</p>

<p>The State Board requested that we do our best to continue to provide the
education opportunities, which would have occurred in the school and
classroom, including those which have been waived by the State Board.
To the best of our ability, we will try to meet the State Board’s intent and at the same time
support the students as they give their best effort.</p>

<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY:</strong> Chromebook devices were sent home with students in 7-12<sup>th</sup> grade.
Students not at school were allowed to come to school to pick up a device before schools were
closed to students. The technology department is ensuring that core
systems and equipment remain functional until students return to school.</p>

<p><strong>CHROMEBOOK REPAIR:</strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday each week, parents and/or students will be able to bring in their Chromebooks
needing exchanged for a working model.</p>

<p>Location: Filer Middle School northeast entrance (by the Bandroom entrance)<br>
Day: Wednesdays<br>
Time: 7:30 AM - 8:30 AM</p>
 
<p>Procedures: </p>
<ol>
<li>Notify school contact that a replacement Chromebook is needed using this form link by
Tuesday at noon each week.  This will allow staff to have a replacement prepared.</li>
<li>Parents/students will drive up to the Filer Middle School northeast entrance.</li>
<li>Parents/students will be asked to stay in their car and turn-in Chromebook needing replaced after cleaning with sanitizing wipes provided.</li>
<li>A sanitized replacement Chromebook will then be issued to parents/students</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>INTERNET ACCESS</strong></p>
<p>Each building reached out to parents to determine internet access. If you are having problems in
this areas reach out to the building principal or your student’s teacher. The school district has
worked to extend access to the internet at the high school. All students in the district may logon
to the internet at the high school provided they have a district issue device or can logon to the
district sever using their device.</p>

<p>To assure health safety students are only to access this from their cars and not congregate with
other students. The best access is near the Ag. Shop, track area, and baseball field.</p>

<p><strong>FOOD SERVICE (DAILY)</strong></p>
<p>Filer School District has been serving about 300 students a day. Food is served at Filer
Elementary at 10:00 a.m. and Hollister Elementary at 12:00 noon. They provide breakfast and
lunch. Free breakfasts and lunch are available for children ages 1-18. Children will need to be
present to receive a meal and the meal will need to be taken offsite to be eaten.</p>

<p><strong>FOOD BANK:</strong> For many students we provide a back pack with food supplies each Friday.
We will continue that service until students return to school.</p>


<p><strong>MAINTENANCE:</strong> The custodial and maintenance staff have gone the extra mile to complete
deep cleaning and disinfect each building. They will continue to inspect the schools and work on
high touch areas as needed.</p>
