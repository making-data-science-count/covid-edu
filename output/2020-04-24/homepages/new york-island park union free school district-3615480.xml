<p>April 24, 2020</p>
<p>Dear Hegarty Family,  </p>
<p>I hope everyone is in good health and spirits. As the days go by, the staff and I miss seeing the children and families of FXH. To keep us all connected, the Hegarty teachers will be hosting Google Meet sessions with their students once a week. We will begin our Google Meets on Friday, May 1st. All Pre-K through grade two students will meet with their students on Mondays at 12:00 PM. In addition, grade three and four students will meet with their students on Fridays at 12:00 PM. Our special area teachers including art, music, FLES (Spanish), health, computer, gym and library will be meeting with the children on a rotating basis. Please be sure to check their daily websites for the schedule. All Google Meets will allow the children to connect with their peers and teachers. All classroom teachers will be contacting the children during the week of April 27th to give them their e-mail addresses. I am looking forward to seeing the children during these times. Below are some expectations for students during Google Meet sessions: </p>
<ul>
<li>All students must use their Island Park e-mails to attend Google Meet sessions</li>
<li>Use your computer, i-Pad, Chromebook or cell phone to join your session</li>
<li>Do not share or give out your e-mail address or password to anyone other than a parent or guardian</li>
<li>No recording of the Google Meet is permitted; no video or audio recording is permitted. This also includes pictures of the session</li>
<li>Be respectful of others </li>
<li>Take turns listening and speaking to others</li>
<li>Have a great time! </li>
</ul>
<p>During the month of May, Hegarty will be posting a Virtual Art Show. Students, please send pictures of your assigned art projects to Mrs. Horn to be part of our show. The deadline for all submissions is Friday, May 15th.  As we continue with our digital learning, please be sure to check the district and teacher websites daily for important updates. Also, be sure to visit the Island Park Schools page on Facebook for district updates.  </p>
<p>Please feel free to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:ccameron@islandparkschools.org" target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" rel="noopener">ccameron@islandparkschools.org</a>.  If you have any questions or concerns, please continue to use the “virtual hand raise” code in the email subject to communicate with your me and your child’s teacher(s). Be sure to check my principal page for daily updates and news.   </p>
<p>We are Hegarty Strong!    </p>

                            <p class="tinymce-block">Dear Parents and Community Members, <br><br>As this point, related service providers have contacted families and routines for telepractice are established. Students, teachers and parents are becoming more adept at the various modes of delivery (i.e., audio, video, audio/visual and virtual instruction). As we continue to develop and move forward with the District’s Distance Learning Program, the instructional/therapeutic process benefits students because they can hear and/or see the teacher/therapist modeling a skill for which students receive immediate feedback as soon as they emulate it. When remote learning is necessary, these are the advantages of telepractice. <br><br>Teacher websites continue to include practices for virtual instruction. They are “Virtual Hand Raise (in the Subject of an email),” Nearpod lessons, ThinkCentral (reteach materials), MyON access for digital books; iReady, and Khan Academy for modeling skills and strategies such as analyzing text passages. Also, teacher constructed materials continue to include tools such as graphic organizers for note-taking and independent reading, and response choice boards to support writing, decoding, encoding, visualizing, and sequencing. <br><br>In addition, for your information, the New York State Education Department has posted resources on a Digital Content Resources Page (<a href="http://www.nysed.gov/edtech/digital-contentresources" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">http://www.nysed.gov/edtech/digital-contentresources</a>). This is a list of websites that are options for virtual field trips and academic resources by topic for students and families. These sites include quality resources and learning activities available online. Some which may be ideal for students and families include: <br><br>• New York State Museum Facebook Live Field Trips <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nysmuseum" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/nysmuseum</a> The New York State Museum is taking viewers behind the scenes of exhibitions and collections by offering Facebook Live Field Trips. State Museum scientists, historians and educators highlight interesting finds and facts about New York State history, science and culture. Every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday students and families can join scientists, historians and educators behind the scenes of the Museum's exhibitions and collections. The Museum highlights interesting finds and facts about New York State history, science and culture.

                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Dear Island Park Families,</p>
<p>At the Tuesday, April 21, 2020 Board of Education meeting, “Emergency Grading Procedures” were presented to the Board for approval and public comment. Below, is our outline of grading practices for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. In addition, attached please see our presentation on Continuity of Learning: Phase II and Grading. More details on this will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the District’s grading practices is to communicate progress that is representative of each student’s achievement and work habits/effort.  It is intended to be helpful to parents, and supportive of students. Based upon the extended school closure, students’ grades will not be penalized by the loss of in-class learning days; nor will they be inflated because of it. As a result,grading by teachers of students working remotely from home through distance learning, will take into consideration several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an adjustment period for students and teachers as they transition to distance learning. </li>
<li>Students and families may be subject to illness, hospital stays, temporary housing, etc. that preclude students from doing and/or completing work.</li>
<li>Unless students are provided devices on an individual basis, there will be challenges in households to schedule time for home device usage and this will create inequitable learning opportunities among students.</li>
<li>Materials for project-based learning may not be available to students and families who are self-isolating.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Francis X. Hegarty Trimester 3 Grading</u></p>
<p>Based upon the length of the school closure, the District recognizes that there are many factors that hinder a teacher(s) ability to accurately report mastery of standards at the elementary level.  Therefore, the report card will remain blank in the standards-based boxes that typically indicate a 1-4 level.  Each student will receive comments regarding participation in online instruction and more individualized feedback regarding learning via the narrative comments. Work Habits/Effort for online instruction will be calculated and recorded as usual. It is important to note that based upon the District’s “do no harm” grading philosophy these grades will not be used to deny any student entrance to the Discovery program.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Lincoln Orens Middle School Quarter 4 Grading</u></strong></p>
<p>As with the elementary grading, assessing student achievement at the middle school level, will be based upon the District’s “do no harm” philosophy.  Students can “earn” a grade for achievement that is reflective of their work throughout the distance learning period as they would during any other time.  However, if the work during the distance learning period results in a total grade for that period that is lower than all other in-school periods previously rendered, it will be given a grade of NM (No Mark).  Comments by the teacher to the parent will explain the NM grade.  NMs, however, will not be averaged into the final grade. Work Habits/Effort grades, however, will be calculated and recorded as usual. It is important to note that based upon the District’s “do no harm” grading philosophy these grades will not be used to deny any student entrance to the Discovery program, Regents classes, Honor Roll, High Honor Roll, or National Junior Honor Society.</p>
<p>Under Governor Cuomo’s Executive Order, schools are closed through May 15, 2020. Given the current set of circumstances, there is the potential that the school closure will be extended.  Emergency Grading Practices will remain in effect whether or not we return to our school buildings, or if we continue with our distance learning plan.  In the meanwhile, it is important that you continue to support your child to follow-through with all digital learning assignments.  Continued active engagement over the long haul is essential to minimizing learning loss during this period. </p>
<p>Stay safe and healthy!</p>
<p>Fondly,</p>
<p>Vincent Randazzo<br>Assistant Superintendent\</p>

                        <h3 class="post-title">Superintendent’s Message: April 21, 2020</h3>
                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Dear Parents and School Community,</p>
<p>As we mark our sixth week of distance learning, I am working with administrators and teachers on a plan that will move us into our next phase of distance learning.  Through the “listening and learning” we have been involved in—each and every week—the Board, administrators and teachers have received meaningful feedback from you and your children.  Through this, we have become keenly aware that students miss their teachers, they miss the excitement of experiential and hands-on new learning, and they miss hours of being with classmates and friends. Our principals and teachers have been reaching out through emails, calls, and videos as well as spirit week activities to keep the connection between school and home both lively and meaningful. They have been also using a variety of teaching materials and strategies to meet students’ needs so that learning that occurred from September through mid-March could be solidified.  They have spent the last two weeks moving forward with new learning.</p>
<p>Though the Governor has closed schools through mid-May, we know we have an obligation to be prepared for schools to remain closed longer.  (Including this week, ten weeks of school remain. That’s two and a half months, which is a long time!) We also must be able to return to school at a moment’s notice and hit the road running the instant doors open. To this end, the next stage of learning must embrace, equally, new content and concepts as well as new means by which teachers make connections and communicate with students and parents.</p>
<p>Tonight, at our Regular Business Meeting of the Board of Education (7:00 PM), I will be presenting an outline of our new plan for “Continuity of Learning: Phase Two” to the Board. Mr. Randazzo will be explaining our plan for “Grading during Extended School Closure.”  It will focus on last quarter progress monitoring and grading (for the middle school students) and last trimester progress monitoring and grading (for the elementary school students).  Our combined PowerPoint presentations will be posted tonight.  We will also have them posted tomorrow morning with all other COVID-19 communications.  We welcome you to login to the Board Meeting through our website (see BoardDocs) for our Student of the Month recognition awards (February and March), which will be followed by the superintendents’ two reports (about 7:30 PM) as well as general news and business actions. As always, there is a Public Be Heard component of the meeting in which we welcome your questions.  You can participate through the email address <a href="mailto:PublicBeHeard@islandparkschools.org" target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" rel="noopener">PublicBeHeard@islandparkschools.org</a> or through the virtual hand raise function in Webex (be sure you have the Cisco app or software downloaded to your device).  Mr. Randazzo’s letter to you tomorrow will summarize highlights from tonight’s Board meeting presentation.</p>
<p>My continued best wishes to you and your family for good health and happiness.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rosmarie T. Bovino, Ed.D.<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>

                        <h3 class="post-title">Message from Kathleen McDonough, Board Trustee  4-20-20</h3>
                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Dear Neighbors, Friends and Loved Ones,<br><br>Over the past few weeks, we have been faced with unprecedented times. While Island Park might be a small town, we are without a doubt a strong one that always bands together. As someone who was born and raised here, Island Park has always been a town that puts our personal needs aside to help our fellow neighbors. I have witnessed the selflessness first hand with our residents purchasing food in our local grocery stores for their elderly neighbors and leaving them on their doorsteps. The daily birthday parades that have grown to thirty plus cars on any given day that put enormous smiles on faces both young and old along the route, are momentous. Residents making face masks and donating or delivering food to hospitals is another example of why I have such pride in our community. I would be remiss to not acknowledge our dedicated Island Park Fire Department volunteers for leading our birthday parades and driving the Easter Bunny around town the same as they do for Santa in December, in addition to their tireless efforts of ensuring our safety on a daily basis. Thank you for your service! Our school district community is no different. Please know that we are doing everything within our power to ensure that our students have a sense of normalcy with their education, while maintaining a healthy balance of down time which is a necessity for the mental health of the entire family.<br><br>As an educator and mother of a sixth and third grader, I understand the challenges of finding a healthy balance between working from home as a government employee and ensuring my children have completed their daily assignments, all while keeping everyone healthy, happy and safe. Some days are harder than others and that is okay. I have found that maintaining a schedule that consists of breaking up their day works best for us. You know your child best! If they need some down time then give it to them. You can always let them grab a snack, have a picnic in your backyard or go for a family walk while practicing social distancing to enable your child to regroup and then continue their assignments. Some children work best standing; let them stand. Other children work best laying on the floor, so let them lay. There will be plenty of time for them to sit still in their desks when everyone returns to school. If you need assistance with your school aged child I encourage you to reach out to your child’s principal, teachers, psychologist, social worker, related service provider or support staff. They are here and willing to assist you with any academic concerns you might have.<br><br>Just like our Island Park teachers, I must continue to provide instruction to my students through distance learning. The struggle of continuing to educate my students without my materials in hand is at times challenging. I have learned to embrace the internet and the available materials within it. Google Classroom and I have become best friends over the last few weeks. I have spent hours learning about new websites, programs and how to upload documents to make sure that my students continue to learn their third grade curriculum.<br><br>I have never been prouder than I am today to be an Island Park School District Trustee and represent this beautiful community. Our teachers and administration are truly top notch. Once again, they were faced to make last minute decisions with constant changing hurdles and did not once hesitate to put their personal needs aside and rise to the occasion. In doing so, their goals have always remained the same: to ensure the safety, well being and education of your child(ren). They have accomplished this without ever having missed a beat. Know that all we are asking of you is to try your very best. Once we are all back together in our classrooms, our faculty, staff and administration will ensure that any gaps your child may experience will be addressed. That is what we are trained to do. As educators, we worry about your children because they become ours the moment they walk through that door. Thank you for sharing them with us!<br><br>At this point in time my son should be playing on his Little League team, learning new karate moves and attending religion classes. My daughter should have been in school on her birthday celebrating by having her locker decorated for the first time, taking religion classes and performing in our school play. My mother had to celebrate her 75th birthday by herself because we are listening to the professionals and practicing social distancing. My hope is that we will all get past this and are back spending time with our loved ones and creating beautiful new memories together shortly.<br><br>I try to live my life by finding the positives, even in the worst scenarios. The Coronavirus pandemic is currently our worst scenario. So here are some positives that I have experienced; I have enjoyed lengthy family dinners with my children without having to race to a practice or meeting, I have cooked meals with my children, I have popped popcorn and cuddled with my children to watch movies or read books almost daily because we have the time, we have gone on walks keeping our distance from others, I have read Facebook posts encouraging people to support our local restaurants, I have watched families spending time together as they pass our home and most importantly, I have created lasting memories with my children that we will cherish forever. I encourage you to look for the daily positives in your life right now. I promise they are there, you just have to look.<br><br>A special thanks to our Island Park residents that are out there placing their lives in danger to keep us safe. Please join me in honoring their tireless efforts by staying home and practicing social distancing. I can’t wait to see you around town and back at our schools and events. Until then, stay safe.</p>
<p><br>Respectfully,<br><br>Kathleen McDonough<br>Island Park School Board Trustee</p>

                            <p class="tinymce-block">Dear New York State Educators,</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Please share this information with families in your community.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">As we work through these challenging times together, NY State of Health is committed to ensuring access to affordable, quality health insurance for all New Yorkers so they can get the care they need during this state of emergency.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">With the recent closure of businesses across the state, many New Yorkers are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage as a result of COVID-19. Many are likely to be eligible for health coverage with financial assistance through NY State of Health due to their loss of coverage and income. NY State of Health opened a Special Enrollment Period last month for people who are uninsured, and the Marketplace has started an awareness campaign to let people know that NY State of Health is there as a safety net in difficult times like these.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">New Yorkers who are without health insurance should apply now through NY State of Health. If you lost employer coverage, you must apply within 60 days of losing that coverage.

                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>I hope this week’s update finds you and your family well.</p>
<p data-event-added="1">At Monday’s Regular Business Meeting of the Board of Education, district participation in a county-wide partnership with SCOPE Educational Services for child care services was approved.  This arrangement, provides parents and guardians who are first responders or health care providers with child care coverage while they are at work.  It is a service that will be free of charge in appreciation for the selfless service these people are providing during the COVID-19 pandemic when schools and after-care programs are closed. First responders and health care providers can register by visiting <a href="http://www.scopeonline.us/" target="_blank" id="LPlnk998797" data-auth="NotApplicable" rel="noopener">www.scopeonline.us</a>. See the words, “Click Here for SCOPE Emergency Child Care.” The host site is Rhame Avenue School, <span class="_2HwZTce1zKwQJyzgqXpmAy" tabindex="0" role="link" data-markjs="true">100 Rhame Ave, East Rockaway, NY 11518</span>.  It begins Thursday, April 2.</p>
<p>Now that the Governor’s Executive Order has extended our work from home period until April 15<sup>th</sup>, we are working with our teachers to develop the next phase of distance learning for <u>all</u> students. Below are a few important updates.</p>
<p><strong><u>Early Elementary Digital Learning</u></strong></p>
<p>Our early elementary grade students (Pre K through Grade 2), were provided with print material such as books, workbooks, and other documents sent home via backpack. We recognize that our students have engaged in this print work over the past two-weeks, and are in need of new learning materials. In addition to digital learning, our teachers will continue to provide the students with learning activities that do not require the use of a computer. New learning for our Pre K through Grade 2 students will continue to be communicated via each teacher’s webpage.</p>
<p><strong><u>Technology-Based Learning</u></strong></p>
<p>The District continues to use a variety of technology-based solutions to ensure students continue their academic work while at home. We recognize that these are challenging times for our students and their parents, as many households are sharing computing devices to complete schoolwork, while parents are working from home. We understand that parents are making requests of both administrators and teachers regarding the need for additional computing devices. This is not possible.  We suggest that families create schedules to share their home device(s). Please note that the District’s technology-based solutions (iReady, myON, Google Classroom, etc.) can also be accessed using a smartphone.</p>
<p><strong><u>Quarter Three Reporting (LOMS)</u></strong></p>
<p>The third quarter for LOMS students is scheduled to end on Wednesday, April 8<sup>th</sup>. Due to the extended school closure, LOMS teachers will provide a third-quarter grade, for students in grades 5-8. This grade follows the District’s Grading Policy, considering only exams, quizzes, and other formative assessments such as  projects, presentations, etc completed through Friday, March 13, 2020. We acknowledge that students may have missing assignments, tests and quizzes that will be difficult to be made-up, submitted, and graded. Therefore, we will not expect that LOMS students submit missed assignments at this time. Given the current set of circumstances, no child’s grades and/or academic standing will be impacted by the extended school closure. Although students’ digital assignments will not be computed into their quarter-three achievement grades, students’ active participation via digital learning, will be factored into their “effort” grade.</p>
<p>The Island Park UFSD will continue to provide our parents and students with all pertinent information throughout this quickly evolving situation. We remind parents and students to contact teachers via the District’s email system using the code words “virtual hand raise” for any questions or concerns related to digital assignments. Our support staff, guidance counselor, school social workers, and school psychologists are also available to assist our families during these uncertain times. We hope that you and your loved ones remain in good health. We look forward to the having our schools, halls, classrooms and instructional spaces filled with our faculty, staff and most of all our students!</p>
<p>Together we are better!</p>
<p>Fond regards,</p>

                        <h3 class="post-title">Let’s Turn the Page on March …</h3>
                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Today we say farewell to March, and I’m sure none of us is sorry to see it go. The words “March Madness” will never again have quite the same meaning. In March, the world as we know it came grinding to a halt, and friends, neighbors, and relatives that we would always greet with a handshake, or a hug, or a kiss, were suddenly restricted to remain at least six feet away. Occasions and events were postponed or canceled or altered to fit “social distancing” guidelines. Kids that normally would spend their day in school with their classmates and playing outdoors with their friends were now confined to their homes, doing lessons remotely while their parents struggled to help them learn and keep them occupied – the struggle is real! Working from home became the norm and the fight for a quiet workspace and bandwidth replaced fighting through traffic and for a seat on a train.  And even though our first responders and healthcare workers have continued to report to their jobs as usual, it has been anything but business as usual for them; they are constantly exposed to danger and for the most part are separated from their families in some way as they care for the sick and keep all of us safe. Our elderly and most vulnerable are the loneliest among us, disconnected from loved ones which, although it is for their own good, cannot be easy on them as they sit anxiously waiting for something not (hopefully) to happen. There are those of us that are struggling economically, whether it be due to the closure of a business or the loss of a job, and even if those situations are temporary the unknown of when things will improve hangs over the heads of those that now are living month to month, or week to week, or day to day. Sadly, there are people that we know that have been infected and become seriously ill, and we have heard the news of those that have died. Our hearts hurt for those that are suffering and for the families of those that have passed away, and we hope that their pain is eased as time passes. There is a saying that “March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.” Well, we’ve certainly had our head in the lion’s mouth; it sure would be nice if the lamb would make an appearance.</p>
<p>Hidden in all the gloom that March has brought is the one glimmer of hope that always comes in March – Spring. While it was not “celebrated,” the world kept turning and the calendar kept changing and Spring arrived, and with it, perhaps some hope. As April dawns, we can begin to look ahead to better and brighter days while we remain vigilant in following the guidelines that will help keep us all safe and healthy. At some point, we will all emerge from our hibernation and be able to be together again, in school, at work, in parks, in restaurants and bars, in stores and anywhere we have gathered in the past. We naturally will be smarter and more cautious – this event will have a profound effect on how we interact with each other in the future – but with that knowledge we will regain the feeling that many of us are missing now, the feeling of community. Personally, I look forward to returning to work, to being in court doing the work I enjoy. I look forward to coaching my roller hockey team and little league team, and watching my kids play with their friends and ride their bikes without worrying if they are too close together. I look forward to being able to play hockey with my teammates and friends, and to being able to be together with friends. I look forward to seeing my daughter graduate from middle school and begin her new adventure in high school, and not worrying when my sons leave the house to hang out with their friends. And I’m sure we all look forward to the day our kids go back to school! I could go on and on, but probably most of all, I look forward to the little things, like being in a store where every other person is not wearing a mask and gloves, or shaking a friend’s hand and not worrying about getting sick or getting others sick. Unfortunately, many aspects of our old routines will change, possibly forever, but we can hope that in time we get back to somewhere we will consider normal, and that it will resemble what it used to be. Our job is to do everything in our power so that we <strong><em><u>all</u></em></strong> get to enjoy and experience the new “normal.”</p>
<p>It would be great if we all woke up tomorrow and this all turned out to be an April Fools’ Day prank, but if there is one thing we have learned, this is no joke. Nevertheless, in about a week, many of us will be celebrating – as we do each Spring – the religious holidays of Passover and Easter. These holidays bear great significance during this difficult time: Easter is a celebration of rebirth, and Passover is a celebration of freedom. Our celebrations may look different than they have in past years, but the concept is still the same – we look forward to a new beginning and better times with family and friends. Granted, the future is uncertain to the extent that we do not know when our lives will get back to normal, but as each day passes we get closer to that day. Faith and hope will help get us there.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing everyone in the near future at school events, on the little league field, and out and about in Island Park. Maybe the April showers will make it easier for us to pass the time indoors so we can all be out to enjoy the May flowers together (Sorry for the Dad joke – too corny?). Seriously, I hope everyone stays healthy and makes the most of their time together with family looking forward to being together again with friends and neighbors, as a community. Hope Springs Eternal.</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal">This has been a busy week.  There have been many outreach efforts on the part of our teachers to students. All grade levels are well underway with instruction that includes new learning, not just review.  Similarly, our principals initiated online faculty meetings in Zoom with their teachers. All shared their experiences with distance learning and new strategies for teaching as a result of their communications with parents, students, and each other. The Board of Education, to, will be conducting community outreach via its <strong>Board Meeting on Monday, March 30, 2020 at 7 pm via WebEx</strong>.  See our district website for instructions on how you can attend.  We encourage you to participate by asking questions you may have  through our new email address <a href="mailto:PublicBeHeard@islandparkschools.org." target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" rel="noopener"> PublicBeHeard@islandparkschools.org.</a></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">On Monday, March 30, we will resume our meal distribution program from Lincoln Orens Middle School for students who are eligible for free or reduced price breakfasts and lunches.  The meals are distributed  at the back of the cafeteria (in area where Fall Fair is held) during the hours of 8:30 am to 11:00 am. They are handed out through a sliding window in the kitchen so that parents/guardians and food service staff members are all able to maintain appropriate physical distance. We are most appreciative of our food service staff who are truly dedicated to the students and families of Island Park. </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We also want to thank our custodians who assisted with the opening and closing of our buildings this past week so that Belfor was able to decontaminate and sanitize all areas of our schools this past week. Thank you, too, to our clerical staff whose hours of work at home have enabled the continuity of operations throughout this period.  Everyone has truly pulled together.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As you may have heard today, the Governor stated <strong>schools will remain closed until at least April 15.</strong>  I have not received his updated Executive Order but look forward to reading it.  More to come on this.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">While schools remain closed, in addition to reaching out to the child’s teacher for assistance, other resources include:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Writing Skills</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Proper Posture When Writing on a Table Top</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Feet flat on the floor (A footstool or thick book can be placed under the feet to assist if feet do not reach the floor.) Sit upright in chair.</li>
<li>Wrist supported on table. Paper stabilized by nonwriting hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter Formation</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When printing, prompt your child to use a top down formation: “Start at the top!”</li>
<li>Try this routine: You write the letter…Your child writes the letter…You write the letter…Your child writes the letter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spacing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have child use their finger or a Popsicle stick after each word to create an appropriate space before beginning the next word.</li>
<li>Use graph paper to give a visual cue for spacing out words and letters.</li>
<li>There are many types of writing paper. Be sure to check with your child’s therapist on the best type of paper or strategy for your child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter and word placement</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a green line along the left margin of the paper and a red line on the right to signal where to “start” and “stop.”</li>
<li>If your child has difficulty writing on the line, darken the baseline with a marker.</li>
<li>Use a highlighter to indicate where to write between lines.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Self-regulation</strong> is the ability to control one’s thoughts, emotional responses, actions and level of alertness/attention. It can be influenced by several different factors including sensory processing. <strong>Sensory processing</strong> is how we process information from the world around us as well as what is going on inside of us to produce an appropriate behavioral response. </p>
<p><strong>Calming Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Play games that reinforce structure and require waiting/ turn-taking: red light green light, freeze dance, Simon says.</li>
<li>Yoga, meditation and belly breathing will help child develop better control of their physical body, thoughts, and emotional states. You can start by sitting still with eyes closed with a slow count of 5.</li>
<li>Routines, structure and clear expectations will help your child with selfcontrol. Review any changes to normal routine early.</li>
<li>Provide a quiet personal space for your child to calm. Relaxing music, a bean bag chair or soft pillows to burrow in may be helpful.</li>
<li>Encourage a variety of play/work positions such as standing, lying on the floor, kneeling.</li>
<li>Offer your child a chewy snack to provide organizing sensory input (i.e. Twizzlers, dried fruits, bagels, etc.).</li>
<li>“Heavy work” activities (carrying heavy items, push/pull activities, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energizing Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have your child jump on a mini-trampoline, perform jumping jacks or play hopscotch.</li>
<li>Push-ups on the floor or push-ups against the wall.</li>
<li>Organized sports activities- running, yoga, karate, gymnastics, bike riding.</li>
<li>Climbing on or hanging from playground equipment.</li>
<li>Eating crunchy foods (i.e. popcorn, pretzels, carrots, apples, etc.).</li>
<li>Play and dance to loud, fast-paced music.</li>
<li>Use toys that make noise or light up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for Children with Tactile Sensitivities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Gradually expose your child to different textures going from the least to most messy. (i.e. Play-doh is less messy than shaving cream or finger paints.)</li>
<li>Provide firm pressure rather than light touch when holding hands or giving hugs.</li>
<li>Make sure that blankets, pajamas and clothes are comfortable for the child as this may disrupt their sleep and other daily activities. (i.e. Cut out clothing tags if causing discomfort, wear socks inside out if irritating, etc.)</li>
<li>Use unscented laundry detergent. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attention and Focus</strong> </p>
<p>Also refer to the <strong>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing section</strong>; strategies may also result in improved attention and ability to focus. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a location in the home with minimal distractions when completing structured activities such as homework or studying.</li>
<li>Break down instructions into simple 1-2 step directions.</li>
<li>Have child repeat directions to reinforce understanding.</li>
<li>Use a visual timer to gradually increase attention to a non-preferred activity.</li>
<li>Allow your child to take short, intermittent movement breaks.</li>
<li>Use a reward chart with stickers or checkmarks to reinforce positive behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toilet Training</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Look for signs for readiness, like discomfort when wet or soiled or staying dry for several hours at a time.</li>
<li>Have your child wear easy to manage clothing (i.e. sweatpants).</li>
<li>Establish a schedule according to wetness pattern.</li>
<li>Toileting symbol may be helpful for requests.</li>
<li>Use charts for positive reinforcement and celebrate each success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shoe Tying</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Children typically require demonstration, explanation, and lots of practice to master tying their shoes.</li>
<li>Remember there are two common methods for tying laces; the bunny ear approach using two loops, or the wrap-around technique, making one single loop then wrapping the other string around and tucking through. Try both and see what works best for your child.</li>
<li>Be sure laces are long enough so that your child can make large loops if needed.</li>
<li>Practicing knots on a jump rope or pipe cleaner can also make it easier and more fun.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dressing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Practice dressing skills through pretend play with dress-up clothes or dolls. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Help your child up until the very last step to allow him/her to successfully complete the dressing task. Do less and less as your child can do more and more. For example:</li>
<li>Assist with fastening the zipper but allow the child to pull it up.</li>
<li>Help your child put each leg into his/her pants but have your child pull his/her pants up independently. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Insert a button halfway into the hole, but let your child pull it fully through.</li>
<li>Teach your child to locate the tag first to identify the front when putting on shirts or jackets. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand Washing</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Use Soap</li>
<li>Scrub palm to palm</li>
<li>Scrub back of hands</li>
<li>Wash between fingers</li>
<li>Wash thumbs</li>
<li>Scrub fingernails</li>
<li>Wash wrists</li>
<li>Rinse hands</li>
<li>Dry Hands</li>
</ol>

        <h2 class="tinymce-block" style="text-align: center;">NY State of Health Letter to Families</h2>
<p class="tinymce-block">Dear New York State Educators, </p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Please share this information with families in your community.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">As we work through these challenging times together, NY State of Health is committed to ensuring access to affordable, quality health insurance for all New Yorkers so they can get the care they need during this state of emergency.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">With the recent closure of businesses across the state, many New Yorkers are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage as a result of COVID-19. Many are likely to be eligible for health coverage with financial assistance through NY State of Health due to their loss of coverage and income. NY State of Health opened a Special Enrollment Period last month for people who are uninsured, and the Marketplace has started an awareness campaign to let people know that NY State of Health is there as a safety net in difficult times like these.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">New Yorkers who are without health insurance should apply now through NY State of Health. If you lost employer coverage, you must apply within 60 days of losing that coverage. Because of a loss of income, New Yorkers may also be eligible for Medicaid, the Essential Plan, Child Health Plus, or subsidized Qualified Health Plan coverage.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Thousands of assistors are ready throughout the state to help consumers enroll by phone. NY State of Health is committed to helping New Yorkers get the coverage they need so they can get the care they need. </p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Visit us at: <a href="http://www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov</a> and let us help you find a health care plan that works for you.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">If you have additional questions you can contact the Marketplace directly at 518-486-9102 or <a href="mailto:NYSOH@health.ny.gov" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">NYSOH@health.ny.gov</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Writing Skills</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Proper Posture When Writing on a Table Top</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Feet flat on the floor (A footstool or thick book can be placed under the feet to assist if feet do not reach the floor.) Sit upright in chair.</li>
<li>Wrist supported on table. Paper stabilized by nonwriting hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter Formation</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When printing, prompt your child to use a top down formation: “Start at the top!”</li>
<li>Try this routine: You write the letter…Your child writes the letter…You write the letter…Your child writes the letter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spacing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have child use their finger or a Popsicle stick after each word to create an appropriate space before beginning the next word.</li>
<li>Use graph paper to give a visual cue for spacing out words and letters.</li>
<li>There are many types of writing paper. Be sure to check with your child’s therapist on the best type of paper or strategy for your child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter and word placement</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a green line along the left margin of the paper and a red line on the right to signal where to “start” and “stop.”</li>
<li>If your child has difficulty writing on the line, darken the baseline with a marker.</li>
<li>Use a highlighter to indicate where to write between lines.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Self-regulation</strong> is the ability to control one’s thoughts, emotional responses, actions and level of alertness/attention. It can be influenced by several different factors including sensory processing. <strong>Sensory processing</strong> is how we process information from the world around us as well as what is going on inside of us to produce an appropriate behavioral response. </p>
<p><strong>Calming Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Play games that reinforce structure and require waiting/ turn-taking: red light green light, freeze dance, Simon says.</li>
<li>Yoga, meditation and belly breathing will help child develop better control of their physical body, thoughts, and emotional states. You can start by sitting still with eyes closed with a slow count of 5.</li>
<li>Routines, structure and clear expectations will help your child with selfcontrol. Review any changes to normal routine early.</li>
<li>Provide a quiet personal space for your child to calm. Relaxing music, a bean bag chair or soft pillows to burrow in may be helpful.</li>
<li>Encourage a variety of play/work positions such as standing, lying on the floor, kneeling.</li>
<li>Offer your child a chewy snack to provide organizing sensory input (i.e. Twizzlers, dried fruits, bagels, etc.).</li>
<li>“Heavy work” activities (carrying heavy items, push/pull activities, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energizing Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have your child jump on a mini-trampoline, perform jumping jacks or play hopscotch.</li>
<li>Push-ups on the floor or push-ups against the wall.</li>
<li>Organized sports activities- running, yoga, karate, gymnastics, bike riding.</li>
<li>Climbing on or hanging from playground equipment.</li>
<li>Eating crunchy foods (i.e. popcorn, pretzels, carrots, apples, etc.).</li>
<li>Play and dance to loud, fast-paced music.</li>
<li>Use toys that make noise or light up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for Children with Tactile Sensitivities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Gradually expose your child to different textures going from the least to most messy. (i.e. Play-doh is less messy than shaving cream or finger paints.)</li>
<li>Provide firm pressure rather than light touch when holding hands or giving hugs.</li>
<li>Make sure that blankets, pajamas and clothes are comfortable for the child as this may disrupt their sleep and other daily activities. (i.e. Cut out clothing tags if causing discomfort, wear socks inside out if irritating, etc.)</li>
<li>Use unscented laundry detergent. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attention and Focus</strong> </p>
<p>Also refer to the <strong>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing section</strong>; strategies may also result in improved attention and ability to focus. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a location in the home with minimal distractions when completing structured activities such as homework or studying.</li>
<li>Break down instructions into simple 1-2 step directions.</li>
<li>Have child repeat directions to reinforce understanding.</li>
<li>Use a visual timer to gradually increase attention to a non-preferred activity.</li>
<li>Allow your child to take short, intermittent movement breaks.</li>
<li>Use a reward chart with stickers or checkmarks to reinforce positive behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toilet Training</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Look for signs for readiness, like discomfort when wet or soiled or staying dry for several hours at a time.</li>
<li>Have your child wear easy to manage clothing (i.e. sweatpants).</li>
<li>Establish a schedule according to wetness pattern.</li>
<li>Toileting symbol may be helpful for requests.</li>
<li>Use charts for positive reinforcement and celebrate each success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shoe Tying</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Children typically require demonstration, explanation, and lots of practice to master tying their shoes.</li>
<li>Remember there are two common methods for tying laces; the bunny ear approach using two loops, or the wrap-around technique, making one single loop then wrapping the other string around and tucking through. Try both and see what works best for your child.</li>
<li>Be sure laces are long enough so that your child can make large loops if needed.</li>
<li>Practicing knots on a jump rope or pipe cleaner can also make it easier and more fun.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dressing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Practice dressing skills through pretend play with dress-up clothes or dolls. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Help your child up until the very last step to allow him/her to successfully complete the dressing task. Do less and less as your child can do more and more. For example:</li>
<li>Assist with fastening the zipper but allow the child to pull it up.</li>
<li>Help your child put each leg into his/her pants but have your child pull his/her pants up independently. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Insert a button halfway into the hole, but let your child pull it fully through.</li>
<li>Teach your child to locate the tag first to identify the front when putting on shirts or jackets. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand Washing</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Use Soap</li>
<li>Scrub palm to palm</li>
<li>Scrub back of hands</li>
<li>Wash between fingers</li>
<li>Wash thumbs</li>
<li>Scrub fingernails</li>
<li>Wash wrists</li>
<li>Rinse hands</li>
<li>Dry Hands</li>
</ol>
