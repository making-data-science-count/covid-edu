                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">April 14, 2020</p>
                  <p>Dear Spartan Parents – </p>
                  <p>On Thursday, April 9, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf extended his order to close Pennsylvania schools through the end of the academic year.  Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera issued a proclamation, under the authority granted under Act 13 of the PA School Code, to close all schools until the threat to health and safety caused by the Pandemic of 2020 has ended. While we have been preparing for this potential outcome for several weeks now, this news is difficult to hear. </p>
                  <p>I want to begin by reassuring our families that our Continuity of Education Plan is designed to enable us to continue teaching and learning through June 3, 2020. Our teachers are prepared and committed to provide the best instruction possible as they implement our distance-learning plan.  We will continue to support our families in every way we can during the challenging weeks and months ahead. </p>
                  <p>With the knowledge that schools are now closed for the duration of the school year, we turn our efforts more fully toward Phase II. These critical matters include considerations for graduation and more purposeful learning for our students.   Please see the <a href="covid/PHASE%20II%20FAQs.pdf">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a> for details. </p>
                  <p>Many parents of students have concerns about what the extended school closure means for their child’s long-term learning.  Please know we have already begun discussions on plans and programs to address lost skills when school resumes, as we know this is a reality for many of our students.  We realize recuperation of skills may take some time and we remain dedicated to working diligently with your child, both now within the confines of distance learning, and within in the future when we are back with your children in our schools.  We are here to work with you toward the common goal of closing any additional gaps that occur in your child’s progress because of these school closures.  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps now more than ever, our attention to the social and emotional well-being of our teachers, students, and other members of our community is extremely important. As we adjust to this new normal, it is important to ask for help when we need it, monitor the emotional health of our children and loved ones, and maintain connections with those who are isolated and in need. Resources are available on our website. </p>
                  <p>Our schools are more than just buildings where students gather to learn. Within our schools, students overcome challenges, learn to make friends, and find their spark. The passion our teachers have for their craft inspires ingenuity, perseverance, and hope. However, over the past few weeks, I am more confident than ever that our students and teachers can and will find new ways to connect and celebrate the joy that comes with learning. School is a beautiful place to be – but the spirit of North Schuylkill Schools is in each of us. </p>
                  <p>We share in the disappointment that our families feel, but we also know that the most important concern we share is for the health and well-being of those we care about. As we manage this crisis together, we take comfort in the knowledge that our community is united in our support for one another and for those most vulnerable. </p>

                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">April 9, 2020</p>
                  <p>Dear Spartan Parents – </p>
                  <p>This morning PA Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera issued an order under Act 13 of 2020, to close all public schools through the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. The extended shutdown order affects more than 1.7 million students in public and private K-12 schools. It means children will spend the rest of the year learning remotely. The order applies through the last day of the current academic year, a date that varies among districts because calendars are set by school boards. Currently, our final day is Wednesday, June 3, 2020. </p>
                  <p>Additionally, Governor Wolf is ordering all K-12 schools and programs, public and private, be closed through the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts, Head Start Supplemental Assistance Programs and Preschool Early Intervention programs will also remain closed, and institutions of higher education are prohibited from offering in-person instruction. All of these decisions were made in consultation with the Secretary of Health, based on the most recent information regarding COVID-19 as it relates to the health, safety, and welfare of students, school staff, and communities. </p>
                  <p>Please know that at this time, The North Schuylkill School District will continue with the Continuity of Education Plan found on our district website. We are currently in Phase I – Enrichment and Review of the plan. However, we will move into a more purposeful learning Phase II - Planned Instruction on April 17th. More details will be shared next week. Please encourage your children to continue checking in with their teachers. The administration will continue to work with our staff behind the scenes to provide additional tools and technology as needed during this pandemic. You will be notified by our calling system and/or email of any and all changes being made as we continue to navigate through the challenges that we all currently face. </p>
                  <p>Please know that we are all saddened by this news and all of the events and ceremonies that are lost, but we know that with your continued support we will come out of this stronger than ever. I want to thank all of you for your patience and perseverance. More details will be provided after the Spring Holiday. </p>
                  <p>Yours in Education, <br>

<br><p>Hello Spartan Families – </p>
                  <p>First, I apologize for the length of this correspondence. It does contain very important information. Please read carefully. I would like to personally thank you for your ongoing support during these unprecedented times. The COVID-19 outbreak and actions at the local and state level are continually evolving. We will continue to update our Spartan community periodically throughout this situation. At this time we have the following updates to share: </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Announcement of Flexible Learning</font></strong><br>
                    In light of the Pennsylvania Governor Wolf-imposed school shutdown, the North Schuylkill School District maintains a commitment to our mission to provide our students with opportunities designed to meet individual needs and to ensure that every child has experiences that promote growth and excellence in all academic and social development areas. Today, we are fully engaged in such a challenge. The District is going to offer our students the opportunity to engage in Flexible Learning activities while schools remain closed. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Phone call from Homeroom teacher</font></strong> <br>
                    Starting on Monday, March 30 and continuing Tuesday, March 31, homeroom teachers will begin making initial contact with all students and/or parents of Kindergarten through Twelfth Grade. Our goal is to provide updates, present our continuity of education plan, and ask questions regarding technology. Teachers will be calling using a Google Classroom function that may block or provide an out of the area phone number. Please answer your phone on Monday and Tuesday, expecting to receive an unknown number. Numbers could be originated from the Philadelphia or New York areas.</p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Enrichment and Review</font></strong><br>
                    The goal during this extended school closure is to ensure that everyone is successful – students, parents and teachers. Our teachers have planned weekly review and enrichment activities. It is recommended that students spend at the elementary level approximately 30-45 minutes per subject each week. At the high school level, it is recommended that students spend approximately 60 minutes per subject each week. These activities are not meant to replace daily classroom instruction. We are encouraging all students to do their best to complete the assigned material. </p>
                  <p>Teachers are providing technology (Google Classroom) and non-technology (packets) options. We ask that you choose the option that works for you. Your homeroom teacher will be able to provide you with an explanation of these options to guide you through this Flexible Instruction process. Families will be surveyed for Internet access and devices by homeroom teachers. Students who do have Internet access but not a devices will be issued a District Chromebook. </p>
                  <p>Schuylkill Technology Center (STC), Fountain Springs Cyber Academy (FSCA) and Bloomsburg Advance College Experience (ACE) students are expected to receive further clarification regarding their education in the upcoming week. </p>
                  <p><strong><font color="blue">Google Classroom</font></strong><br>
                    Connecting to Google Classroom on your computer, iPad or smartphone will give you a direct connection to your teacher. Your child can log on using their student id number @gapps.northschuylkill.net account. If your child is not able to access Google Classroom, you can contact your child’s teacher via email. Information will be available online on a weekly basis every Friday with the exception of this week which will be on Wednesday, April 1st. All virtual review and enrichment materials/activities will be available for you through Google Classroom. </p>
                  <p><strong><font color="blue">Packet Work</font></strong><br>
                  For student without Internet access distribution of paper handouts will occur bi-weekly on Fridays from 4PM-6PM and the following Monday from 9AM-11AM at the North Schuylkill Elementary School. The first pick up of physical materials will be Friday, April 3rd and Monday, April 6th. To ensure proper social distancing, we ask that you drive up to the curb at the elementary school and pop your trunk. A North Schuylkill staff member will bring the materials to you and place them in your trunk. No one is permitted to enter the school building. Packets will not be returned to teachers.</p>
				  <p><strong><font color="blue">Communication with Teacher</font></strong><br>
                    Your child's classroom teacher is your best resource to help you with the work he/she is being asked to complete. Communication will occur in other platforms including Google, remind, class dojo, email, phone calls, homework blogs, etc. Feedback will be provided on activities. All teachers will be hosting office hours every Tuesday and Thursday from 1PM-3PM in Google Meet to answer questions or provide clarification on any of the material for each week. </p>
				  <p><strong><font color="blue">Special Education</font></strong><br>
                    We understand that there may be unique challenges for students with disabilities and that this may be a stressful time for our families. Throughout the closure, your child’s special education team will work to provide access to the Flexible Learning framework while considering each child’s specific needs. For support, please reach out to your child’s teacher or therapist. You can also contact Special Education Director, Mr. Knute Brayford, <a href="mailto:kbrayford@northschuylkill.net">kbrayford@northschuylkill.net</a> or Assistant Director of Special Education, Mrs. Christine Greblick <a href="mailto:cgreblick@northschuylkill.net">cgreblick@northschuylkill.net</a>. </p>
				  <p><strong><font color="blue">Student Expectations</font></strong> <br></p>
<li> Monitoring Google Classroom daily or work on packet daily</li>
					  <li>Establishing daily routines for engaging in the learning experiences</li>
					  <li>Being responsible for independent learning and maintaining a positive growth mindset</li>
					  <li>Engaging in all learning with academic honesty</li>
					  <li>Being an advocate and communicating with your teachers</li>
					  <li>Complying with School Internet Safety policies including expectations for online etiquette</li>
				  <li>Completing work by Friday at 3:00PM which will serve as evidence of completion</li>
				  <br><strong><font color="blue">State Assessments</font></strong><br><p> All PSSA testing and Keystone exams for the 2019-20 school year have been cancelled by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Additionally, standardized testing for students in career and technical education (STC) programs for the 2019-20 school year have been cancelled. </p>
				  <p>On March 20, The College Board posted some very important information concerning this year's AP Exams. AP Exams will not be conducted face-to-face this year and tests will be adjusted to reflect school closures. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Technology Support</font></strong><br>
				    We will communicate our plans to distribute District issued Chromebooks in the near future, if one is requested. Additionally, we are not able to repair personal devices. If you need assistance with a District issued Chromebook or Google Classroom please view the student help documents and forms located on our District website. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">End of the 3rd Marking Period</font></strong><br>
				    Based on the most recent information from PDE in regards to the additional week closure, paired with the uncertainty of what may lie beyond April 7th, we will close the third marking period. Report cards will be available during the second week of April. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Meals</font></strong><br>
				    We will continue to provide Grab-and-Go Bagged Breakfast and Lunches at three locations throughout the district during the flexible learning days. In the first week we were able to provide 9,360 meals to our students. For more information visit: <a href="https://bit.ly/NSLunches">https://bit.ly/NSLunches </a></p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">School Calendar</font></strong><br>
				    At this point, we have been granted latitude in the mandatory 180 days of school. We will continue to monitor the situation, follow guidelines provided to us by governmental agencies and determine an updated calendar as soon as possible. The last day of school has not been determined at this point. Spring break will be one day, Good Friday, April 10th. Again, we are not sure if and when we will return to normal operations. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Prom and Graduation</font></strong><br>
				    Personally, of all the many negative things that this closure has caused, I think the most negative affect has been on our 12th graders’ senior year. Please know that we will do everything possible to safe guard these events. In addition, we also realize that some of our seniors have plans shortly after the original date of graduation. Students are going to the armed forces, military academies, and post-secondary education endeavors. We will certainly consider these issues when finalizing schedules and school calendars moving forward. At this time we have been in discussion with Capriottis and are certain the prom will need to be rescheduled to a date in the summer. </p>

                  <p>The North Schuylkill School District has collected a list of resources for parents to utilize during the mandatory school closure. Please note, these are optional and are not assignments. We hope these learning tools will help to keep your student engaged in the learning process during this unprecedented time.  Additional resources will be added to the resource pages as we find them. <br></p>

                  <p>Spartan Community -<br><br>
                    “The Department of Education (PDE) announced today that all schools in the commonwealth will remain closed through at least April 6 as a result of the COVID-19 response efforts. The closure order could be extended beyond April 6 if necessary, to save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>
                    Under the new timeline, school buildings would reopen on Tuesday, April 7 for two days to allow school administrators, teachers, and other staff time to prepare classrooms, set up cafeterias, schedule transportation and arrange other business operations. Students would return to school on Thursday, April 9, unless extending the closure is needed in response to the situation with the virus at that time.”<br><br>
                    The North Schuylkill School District will take the time needed to evaluate this decision and provide additional details specific to our school district over the next few days. We are still waiting for further clarification and direction from the state about what “continuity of learning” means and should look like. Please continue to check our web site and Facebook page during this time.<br><br>
                    On a final note, As each day of this pandemic passes, we are confronted with sadness and despair about what was lost or may be in jeopardy of being lost. Aside from worrying about basic needs being met, we worry about what will happen with the end of the marking period, student grades, musicals, spring sports, concerts, field trips, prom, graduation, etc. Your concerns about our ability to offer these, in some instances, once in a lifetime events, is understandable. I wish I had a definitive answer for each one of them, but I do not. However, I will leave you with this. As we continue down this uncharted path, we will do our best to postpone these moments that students looked forward to and worked to achieve and not cancel them. <br><br>
                    Again, I want to thank you for your support this past week and as we move forward.<br><br>
                    Stay healthy and be well,<br>

                  <p>Parents/Guardians, The North Schuylkill School District hopes to get back to normal operations in the very near future. We are still in the process of waiting for guidance from the state in regards to instructional days, assessments, etc. We also want to provide continuity of education to provide normalcy, connection, and of course education to our students.</p>
                  <p>We are formulating a plan in order to be able to deliver instruction to students without them physically being in one of our buildings. In order to plan for this, we need to know if students have access to the internet and if they have access to a computer or tablet. </p>
                  <p>We ask that you please visit the link below to complete a brief survey for each child in your home. This will provide us information about our potential next steps moving forward. If you are unable to complete the survey online, a member of our administrative team will reach out to you by phone beginning Tuesday, March 24, 2020. </p>

                  <p>We continue to navigate the continued challenges associated with the social distancing that is meant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We would like to provide you with a few reminders and updates.</p>
                  <p>Governor Wolf announced a statewide two-week school district closure and has provided additional guidance to districts regarding our responsibility for the continuity of instruction. We have compiled a list of Frequently Asked Question (FAQs) to assist you. </p>

                  <p>We know that you have many questions now and will have more in the days to come. While some of the more complex questions can’t be answered yet, we have created a page on our website to house resources and frequently asked questions associated with Coronavirus COVID-19. Visit <a href="http://www.northschuylkill.net/">www.northschuylkill.net </a></p>
                  <p>If you have any further questions or comments during this closure, the District set up an email account that will be monitored by multiple administrators.  Email <a href="mailto:concerns@northschuylkill.net">concerns@northschuylkill.net</a></p>
                  <p>Please know, it will take some time to consider what the impact of a prolonged closure will be for North Schuylkill. In addition, we are awaiting additional guidance on more complex matters from the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania such as the 180-school day requirements, state testing and much more.  We continue to be in regular contact with local, state, and federal authorities, as well as our neighboring districts. </p>
                  <p>As a reminder, all NSSD campuses and buildings are closed and secured. The coming weeks will continue to challenge us as a community and as a nation. We have said it many times, but we are deeply grateful for the support of our families and the entire North Schuylkill District community. Please continue to care for one another and reach out to those who are vulnerable. </p>

                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">March 13, 2020</p>
                  <p>North Schuylkill SD Families: <br><br>
                    The health, safety and security of our students and staff are our highest priorities. We take very seriously our role in the protection of our most precious people. It is my hope that you believe in our commitment to your child and the well-being of all in our school community.</p>
                  <p>The recent events surrounding the COVID-19, Coronavirus, have made for difficult decisions on the national, state and local level. While there is an abundance of information available, guidance and direction have been limited. With that being the case, we are left with trying to make the best decision possible, in areas that are not part of our expertise. </p>
                  <p>After conferring with state officials, county superintendents and analyzing the best data available at this time, we will institute the following: </p>
                  <p>• Beginning Monday, March 16, 2020, all schools in the North Schuylkill SD will be closed for two weeks. No one is to enter without approval of the Superintendent. <br>
                    • Tentative Reopen date would be March 30, 2020. <br>
                    • At the close of schools today, all students and staff should take home all resources that they may need for instruction. These would include textbooks, workbooks and technology. These items will only be expected to be used if the closure persists longer than the two weeks. <br>
                    • During the two-week break, the buildings will be thoroughly cleaned and then closed. For those essential people who are needed to clean and secure the buildings during that time, extra protocols will be in place to ensure contamination does not occur. <br>
                    • No school events of any kind will occur. They will be postponed when possible or cancelled if that is the only other option. <br>
                    • At this time, the makeup of school days will occur through the utilization of makeup days at the Easter Holiday and days added to the end of the year. This is subject to change should the Department of Education provide relief in some way. If so, our District will seek that relief whether it is in number of required days or hours. </p>
                  <p>During the two-week period, we highly recommend that students do not regularly leave their home, travel or place themselves in situations that promote the transmission of the virus. We ask that everyone follow the rules established for social distancing and the hygiene efforts that have been in place for some time. </p>
                  <p>Please know that this decision does not come without knowledge of the disruption this causes for our students, staff and families. It has not been taken lightly. We recognize the burden this places on families. We are also saddened with the possible opportunities that are lost because of the closure. It is only because of the possible health risks to so many that this decision, while difficult, is being made. None of us wants to be the one whose child is sick or whose grandparent becomes gravely ill. Mitigating the number infected is our main goal. </p>
                  <p>In a best case, the virus begins to fade, effects very few and we return to classes soon. The worst-case scenario has played out across the world. We hope to reduce that likelihood. </p>

                  <h5 class="blog-list-title">Coronavirus: COVID-19</h5>
                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">March 12, 2020</p>
                  <p>Spartan Community —<br><br></p>
<p>We are  receiving questions to the inevitable spread of COVID-19 (the “Coronavirus”).  Due to the rapidly changing manner in which regional and national organizations are working to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals and factoring in recent updates from local and national governmental and health agencies, North Schuylkill School District has teamed-up with other Schuylkill County Schools and the Schuylkill County Emergency Agency to develop a joint press release and a Schuylkill County Pandemic Action Plan.  <a href="pdf/district/COVID-19%20Press%20Release%203%2012%202020.pdf">Please see attached</a>. </p>

<p>In the North Schuylkill School District, students and staff will be asked to stay home for a period of 14 days from the time they left an area with widespread or ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).  China, Iran, Italy and South Korea are currently listed on the CDC Level 3 Travel Health Alert –   <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html</a>.
</p>

<p>Closures of schools serve two purposes: (1) to prevent the ready transmission of a disease in a community where that disease is known to be prevalent and (2) to allow for building decontamination or cleaning.  Again, given when the prevalence and duration of a COVID-19 outbreak in any given community is unknown.</p>

<p>At this time, the North Schuylkill School District’s plan to provide instruction to our students, if we have to close suddenly due to the coronavirus or other emergency, would be the same as a cancellation due to weather.   If the District would close before the scheduled Spring Break (April 9 – April 19), the District would utilize those built in snow make-up days (6 days available).  Good Friday, April 10th, would not be used as a make-up day and would remain a non-school day.  If the District would close after the Spring Break (April 20), the original graduation date of June 3, 2020, will be moved and make-up days will be added to the end of the year. </p> 

<p>At this time, there has been a small number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Pennsylvania. As a school district, we will continue to closely monitor the situation and take guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>Remember, we all play a role in reducing the likelihood of a coronavirus outbreak in our school district community. We encourage everyone to practice good habits, including: </p>
● Wash your hands regularly, especially after using the restroom and before preparing or consuming food. Using soap and hot water, wash for about 20 seconds. Be sure to also wash your fingertips.<br>
● Avoid coughing or sneezing into your hands or in the air. Always try to cough or sneeze into a tissue, and then throw the tissue away. If you don’t have a tissue, cough/sneeze into your arm. <br>
● As much as you can, avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.<br> 
● If children are feeling sick, please keep them home from school. Allow them some time to feel better so that they do not risk infecting others. 

<p>As we continue to engage in planning and discussion around the impact of coronavirus, both in and around our community, please remember that the virus is unpredictable causing a very dynamic and constantly changing response.</p> 

<p>If you have any questions, please contact me at rackell@northschuylkill.net</p> 

Stay Well, <br>

                  <p>First and foremost, thank you to our outstanding community here at North Schuylkill, Schuylkill County and the state! It has been awe-inspiring to see the response to the #Prayersfor6 tshirt. We had originally planned to hold a tshirt sale to the public tomorrow but due to the overwhelming response we will be unable to fulfill these plans. </p>
				<p> We want to ensure that all individuals and groups that would like to support Jaden and his family have an opportunity to purchase shirts and wristbands. In order to best accomplish this we will be doing the following.</p>	
                  <p>o	Starting tomorrow we will be taking prepaid orders at our High School.<br>
						o	Orders will not be filled until we are caught up on our current orders.<br>
						o	Once all existing orders are filled we will be filling new orders on a first come first served basis.<br>
						o	We will call you when your order is filled and hold it until you can pick it up.<br>
						o	Some Shirts and Wristbands may be available at tomorrow night’s game, although we cannot guarantee what sizes will be available.<br>
						o	We are committed to fulfilling all orders by next Friday, November 8.<br></p>
                  <p>We thank you in advance for your patience and understanding on this matter, and ask that we all remember to keep Jaden in our prayers. North Schuylkill School District and the surrounding communities have shown that when we work together anything is possible, we all can be proud to say that we are #JADENSTRONG!</p>

                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">October 4, 2019</p>
                  <p><img src="images/pahealth.jpg" width="297" height="72" alt=""></p>
				  <p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE <br>
					  October 4, 2019 </strong></p>
				  <p><strong>Department of Health Provides Update on Lung Injuries Associated with Vaping, Urges Caution and Awareness </strong></p>
					<p><strong>Harrisburg, PA</strong> –Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine today announced that the Pennsylvania Department of Health has confirmed one death and multiple cases attributed to lung injuries associated with vaping in Pennsylvania and recommends that people do not vape. </p>
					<p>“The lung injury cases are very serious, life-threatening and even fatal,” Dr. Levine said. “We do not yet know what is making people sick, and whether the illnesses are related to products being used, or potentially the delivery of those products. I strongly urge everyone who is vaping illegally bought products, in particular those with THC, to stop. In addition, there could be possible risks with legally purchased products. We want to warn people that investigations are ongoing and we advise they use extreme caution before using any vaping product at this time.” </p>
                  <p>Pennsylvania has reported nine confirmed and 12 probable cases of the lung illness to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and are investigating an additional 63 cases. Each of the individuals involved in the cases have suffered serious lung injuries and most have been hospitalized. </p>
                  <p>“Many medications carry risk and vaping medical marijuana products sold in our dispensaries carries risk in the same way that other medications do,” Dr. Levine said. “If you are vaping, whether as part of the medical marijuana program or not, it is essential that you have an honest conversation with your physician about the potential risk for serious illness. For those who are part of the medical marijuana program and have concerns, we encourage you to talk to your physician or the pharmacist at the dispensary.</p>
                  <p>Signs and symptoms of a potential lung injury associated with vaping include: </p>
                  <p>• Cough; <br>
                    • Shortness of breath; <br>
                    • Chest pain; <br>
                    • Nausea or vomiting; <br>
                    • Diarrhea; <br>
                    • Fatigue; <br>
                    • Fever; or <br>
                    • Weight loss. </p>
                  <p>Please see your health care provider if you or a loved one are showing signs or symptoms. </p>
                  <p>The department is continuing to work with the Poison Control Centers in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration as part of this widespread investigation. </p>
                  <p>Generally, e-cigarettes are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products. It is also important to remember that e-cigarette aerosol is not harmless “water vapor.” It can contain harmful substances, including nicotine and ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs; flavoring such as diacetyl, a chemical linked to a serious lung disease; volatile organic compounds; cancer-causing chemicals and heavy metals such as nickel, tin and lead. </p>
                  <p>Additional information on e-cigarettes, the dangers of vaping, and how to quit smoking can be found on the Department of Health’s website at <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx">health.pa.gov</a> or follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pennsylvaniadepartmentofhealth">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PAHealthDept">Twitter</a>.</p>

                    We are now set up to administer the Auto Desk Certified User Exam and the Certified Professional Exam. Currently, the closest testing centers for this are in Williamsport, York, and Quakertown. The fact that the North Schuylkill School District is now a testing site is extremely exciting! This is not just a wonderful opportunity for our students within the district, but also for our community members. They are also provided the opportunity to use the NSSD as the site of their choice for testing. <br><br><strong>Mr. Kelly Stone</strong>, a teacher within the North Schuylkill School District, is the certified instructor. <br><br>

                  <h5 class="blog-list-title">North Schuylkill Tax Increase</h5>
                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">June 26, 2018</p>
                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text"> </p>
                  <p>“The $29,627,835 Final Budget of the North Schuylkill School District reflects an $832,218 or 2.9 percent, in-crease in estimated expenditures over the prior year budget and includes a 1.38-mill tax increase. The annual tax increase for the average home owner would be approximately $30. The increase is primarily a reflection of the years of underfunded mandates placed on the district by the state legislature, specifically, retirement, charter schools and special education.” </p>
                  <p>That’s what the press release stated from our June 20, 2018 meeting. However, people need to understand what schools are up against in meeting the bottom line.<br><br>
                    If anyone believes that school board members want to raise taxes or have a cavalier attitude doing so really don’t have a clear understanding of the multitude of issues that school districts face. Do people truly believe that we want to pay more? We are taxpayers, too. <br><br>
                    Folks are quick to say that we need to live within our budget. We do have a budget that provides a spending framework. Unfortunately, it is the mandates that we must find money to pay for while relying on our representatives to ensure that they fund what they hold us accountable to follow. <br><br>
                    The talk of a budget in Harrisburg on time is welcome news; however, North Schuylkill’s increase from state sources is estimated at merely one percent, or only $89,724 more. While happy to have an increase, our contribution back to the state coffers for the pension plan has increased by 5.5 percent, or $202,000. We have not filled three positions, slashed the amount of allocation for supplies and are creating alternate learning environments to save money on out-of-district placements. </p>
                  <p>In the past few years, we have phased out double-digit positions, replaced full-time positions with part-time ones, changed how our health care plan operates and turned down some much-needed programs that we believe would be beneficial to save money. We are hopeful that the fair funding litigation gets cleared of all of legal hurdles in the appeal process and schools such as ours will have the same opportunities as all others in the state. <br><br>
                    Charter school tuition and costs to educate students who choose not to attend North Schuylkill have also created a financial hardship. We know people say there is a reason that families make the choice to use a different approach; however, some families have never stepped into our district to see what we can offer. They simply didn’t like the place they previously attended and moved into the district and that bill gets shifted onto our district. This cost has risen by $144,000 or 18.24 percent, from the previous year. The state has allowed more than triple the amount of charter or cyber charter schools than originally allocated. <br><br>
                    Property taxes are not a shared responsibility, but not for the reasons that you may think. We hear complaints that those renting don’t pay their fair share, but rest assured landlords aren’t going to pay that on their own and they pass it onto their tenants. One of the main concerns has been that some of our neighbors continue to allow their payments to go into arrears. A few million dollars is still owed to the district. If this was paid regularly we would not have to continue to increase taxes. That said, we encourage you to look on our website, <a>www.northschuylkill.net</a>, to see the lists of delinquents.</p>

                  <p>There is a buzz about property tax reform which, if a fiscally responsible plan would come along, we would support. It would make our volunteer “jobs” much easier and we could focus on what we all are here for, the kids. However, ask yourself some questions before jumping all in on this topic. What happened to the gas tax monies? Our roads are terrible, maybe the worst they have ever been. How about the casino money? PA’s casinos have broken revenue records; however, has the Homestead Act provided you with more money? Or the pension that was referenced earlier — our legislators allowed it to be unfunded for years and now have put the burden on local government to recoup the monies that they mishandled. </p>
                  <p>All of this on the backs of taxpayers. We will continue to try to be financial stewards of the tax dollars we collect and the allocations that we are provided; however, trying to provide a quality education with the dollars provided by our state versus the mandates that they expect you to fund is becoming more difficult. </p>

                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">August 8, 2017<br></p>
                  <p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health is changing the vaccination requirements for your child, beginning in August 2017.<br><br>
                  Your child must be vaccinated, or have a written plan to vaccinate, within one week of the first day of school, or they may not be allowed to attend school. Our first day of school at North Schuylkill is Monday, August 28, 2017. If your child is not vaccinated or does not have a written plan by your doctor for vaccination by Friday, September 1, 2017, your child will not be allowed to attend school starting Tuesday, September 5, 2017.</p>
                  <p>If your child has already received these vaccinations, please send in a written copy of the vaccines to your child’s school for review.<br><br>
                    If your child has NOT received these vaccines, please contact your doctor immediately about scheduling an appointment in order for your child to receive the recommended vaccines for school attendance.</p>
                  <p>If you do not have a doctor, please call the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 877-724-3258. You can also visit the website dontwaitvaccinate.pa.gov for information about these new regulations.</p>
                  <p>These regulations are meant to ensure that children attending school are adequately protected against outbreaks of vaccine preventable illnesses.<br></p>

                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">January 24, 2017<br></p>
                  <p>From HS Activity Director - Jennifer Cory: </p>
                  <p>One of the very first things that must be done when you contact me requesting to rent out the Natatorium is to fill out the <a href="pdf/district/Building%20Usage.pdf"><u>building usage request form</u>.</a> This building request form should be completed about a month and a half/two months before the party because it would need to get approved by the school board at their monthly school board meeting. This completed form, along with my signature, will ensure that there are no other events going on that day which would conflict with their request. Along with this form, a certificate of the party’s <em><u>homeowner’s insurance</u></em> must be handed in as well. <br><br>
                    Within about two weeks of handing in the building usage request form, another form must be handed in as well as a <em>deposit</em> to rent the pool. This form is called the <a href="pdf/hs/NS%20Swimming%20Pool%20Contract.pdf"><u>Swimming Pool Contract form</u></a> and this form illustrates the required documents that must be turned in before the pool party. <br><br>
                    Then, in regards to the specific details, I have a <a href="pdf/hs/NS%20Pool%20Party%20Request%20Form.pdf"><u>rules and rate schedule form</u></a> that must be looked over in advance because this represents what is allowed and what is NOT allowed at NS pool parties while explaining the rate schedule. Normally pool parties are scheduled to last for two hours. And, we have a rate schedule where they pay per hour. We have rates for families that are in the district and we also have rates for out of district families. These rates also increase as the amount of swimmers go up. <br><br>
                  If anyone would like to contact me in regards to having a pool party, my email is <a>jcory@northschuylkill.net </a>(my contact info is also on the forms as well). You can do so that way - and then I will provide all the information they would need to know in order to have a pool party at NS. </p>

                  <p>Dear Parent or Guardian:</p>
                  <p>Doctors and pediatricians in our area are seeing cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease.</p>
                  <p>Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease is <strong>caused</strong> by a virus and is usually seen in children under age 5 and infants. It can be seen in older children and adults. <strong>Pregnant women</strong> should consult with their doctor or obstetrician if they have been exposed or think they have been exposed to an infected individual.</p>
                  <p>The<strong> symptoms </strong>include: fever, decreased appetite, ulcers in mouth, rash primarily on the hands and soles of the feet, and in some cases blisters.</p>
                  <p>It is not usually serious and individuals with Hand, Foot, and mouth <strong>recover </strong>in 7-10 days <strong>without treatment</strong>. </p>
                  <p>It is <strong>spread</strong> by close contact such as coughing, sneezing, kissing, hugging, and sharing cups and utensils with infected individuals. Individuals infected with Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease are contagious <strong>before</strong> symptoms appear. </p>
                  <p>The best way to prevent it from <strong>spreading</strong> is practicing good hygiene: washing hands; sneezing and coughing into tissues and disposing of them immediately; and cleaning surfaces that could be touched by unwashed hands. </p>
                  <p><strong>Good hygiene</strong> at all times is the <strong>most effective method</strong> of preventing the spread of the disease. </p>

                  <p class="blog-list-meta small-text">September, 28 2016<br></p>
                  <p>Dear Parents,</p>
                  <p><strong>Any information contained in this letter is not intended as medical advice, but simply to alert families to the existence of alternatives to opioids and that any such choices should be discussed with their physicians.</strong></p>
                  <p>In 2014 nearly 2500 Pennsylvanians died from drug overdoses, many from opiate-based drugs. I am sure many of you know of people that have died in your area due to an overdose. Unfortunately, many have kept silent due to the social stigma, but that has only fueled an increase in deaths. Heroin does not discriminate among race, ethnicity, gender, nor socio-economic status. If you have chance, please watch this episode from CBS’s 60 Minutes, which originally aired in October, 2015. http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/heroin-in-the-heartland-2/</p>
                  <p>An increasing number of heroin overdoses are being experienced by young adults that have become addicted to opiate-based pharmaceuticals prescribed to them due to school sports injuries or common accidents. Oxycotin, Demerol, and Percoset, and many other opiate-based pain killers, can become highly addictive after an extended period of use. A person that is addicted could purchase Oxycotin on the black market for $80 a pill. Due to that expense, many switch to heroin, which is now only $5 per small bag. However, heroin transforms the brain to want this stimulus in ever increasing quantities. <strong>No one can just experiment with heroin, once you use it you are hooked, and in most cases, heroin will lead to death from overdose.</strong> </p>
                  <p>While we can not totally eradicate the drug problem, we can diminish its effects on society through education. That is the point of this letter. When your child is injured, you do not have to simply accept what the doctor is prescribing for pain. Below is a list of opiate-based drugs, and alternative non-addictive pain killers that can be prescribed instead. Please be aware of your options and ask your doctor or pharmacist these critical questions to save your child from the potential for addiction. Heroin overdoses have increased by over 400% in the last few years. By following this advice, we may finally start witnessing a decrease in opiate addiction, along with overdoses caused by addicts switching to the cheaper fix of heroin. Thank you for your consideration. </p>
