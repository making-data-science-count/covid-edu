Michigan has become the first state in the country to gain federal approval of a program that will provide nutritious food to children who were affected by school closings due to COVID-19.<br>
 <br><b>P-EBT</b> provides temporary funding to address emergency food needs and avert financial hardship for families affected by the pandemic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Families not currently receiving food assistance benefits will receive an EBT card in the mail by mid-May.</li>
<li>Those already receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits will see benefits added to their card.</li>
</ul>
Families can use your pre-loaded EBT card at any retailer that accepts SNAP EBT benefits. Visit the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailer-locator">SNAP Retailers website</a> for a list of retailers.<br>
 <br>
The food assistance benefits will go to Michigan families with students ages 5-18 who are enrolled in the Michigan Department of Education program for students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals prior to the unanticipated school closure.<br><br>
If your school participates in the Community Eligibility Provision, all students are eligible for free meals and qualify for P-EBT benefits.<br><br>
Families will see a combined benefit for March and April of $193.80 per eligible student. Benefits will be loaded to your family’s EBT card by mid-May. Additionally, the combined benefit for May and June will be $182.40 per eligible student, which will be loaded on the card at a later date.<br><br><strong>Please know, we have all data on file and there is no need to submit a new application at this time.</strong><br><br>
