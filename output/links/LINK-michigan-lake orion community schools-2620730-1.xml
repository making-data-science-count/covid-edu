<p>The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. The simple everyday actions you can take to help prevent the spread of flu and the common cold will also help prevent the spread of coronaviruses.</p>

<p>These include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Washing your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throwing the tissue in the trash.</li>
	<li>Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, sharing cups, or sharing eating utensils, with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs.</li>

<p>If you are sick with COVID-19 or suspect you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, follow the steps below to help prevent the disease from spreading to people in your home and community.</p>

<p><strong>Stay home except to get medical care</strong></p>

<p>You should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</p>

<p><strong>Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home</strong></p>

<p>People: As much as possible, you should stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.</p>

<p>Animals: You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask. See <u><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#2019-nCoV-and-animals">COVID-19 and Animals</a></u> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Call ahead before visiting your doctor</strong></p>

<p>If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.</p>

<p><strong>Wear a facemask</strong></p>

<p>You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) or pets and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then people who live with you should not stay in the same room with you, or they should wear a facemask if they enter your room.</p>

<p><strong>Cover your coughs and sneezes</strong></p>

<p>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw used tissues in a lined trash can; immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.</p>

<p><strong>Clean your hands often</strong></p>

<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid sharing personal household items</strong></p>

<p>You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home. After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.</p>

<p><strong>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces everyday</strong></p>

<p>High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.</p>

<p><strong>Monitor your symptoms</strong></p>

<p>Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening (e.g., difficulty breathing). <strong>Before</strong> seeking care, call your healthcare provider and tell them that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19. Put on a facemask before you enter the facility. These steps will help the healthcare provider’s office to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected or exposed. Ask your healthcare provider to call the local or state health department. Persons who are placed under active monitoring or facilitated self-monitoring should follow instructions provided by their local health department or occupational health professionals, as appropriate.</p>

<p>If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have, or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before emergency medical services arrive.</p>

<p><strong>Discontinuing home isolation</strong></p>

<p>Patients with confirmed COVID-19 should remain under home isolation precautions until the risk of secondary transmission to others is thought to be low. The decision to discontinue home isolation precautions should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong> </p>

<p>April 24, 2020 </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Governor Whitmer Extends Stay Home, Stay Safe Order, Directs Michiganders to Wear Homemade Masks in Enclosed Public Spaces</strong> </p>

<p align="center"><em>Governor’s Executive Order Lifts Restrictions on Activities like Lawn Care, Golfing, Boating</em> </p>

<p align="center"><strong> </strong> </p>

<p><strong>LANSING, Mich. -- </strong>Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed executive order 2020-59, extending her “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order through May 15. The new order will require people to wear homemade face coverings when they enter enclosed public spaces. It will also lift some restrictions on outdoor activities and allow some workers who perform previously suspended activities to go back to work. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Data shows that most Michiganders are doing their part by staying home and staying safe. That’s good, but we must keep it up. Social distancing is our best weapon to defeat this enemy,” said<strong>Governor Whitmer.</strong> “With new COVID-19 cases leveling off, however, we are lifting some of the restrictions put in place in the previous order. I want to be crystal clear: the overarching message today is still the same. We must all do our part by staying home and staying safe as much as possible.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The numbers we’ve seen in the past week have shown a plateau in positive cases, but Michiganders must continue doing their part to fight this virus and protect their families,” said MDHHS Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive <strong>Dr. Joneigh Khaldun</strong>. “The governor has taken a number of critical steps to protect Michigan families, and this order today will allow that work to continue. We will keep monitoring the data closely and work with our partners across state government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The order will require people to wear homemade, non-medical grade face coverings when they enter enclosed public spaces. It will also require employers to provide at least cloth face coverings to their employees. People won’t have to wear face coverings when they’re taking a walk in the neighborhood, but when they go to the grocery store, they should be wearing one. Under the order, however, no one will be subject to criminal penalty for going without a mask. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The new executive order will also allow some workers who perform very previously suspended activities to go back on the job. Landscapers, lawn-service companies, and nurseries can return to work, subject to strict social distancing. Retailers to that do not sell necessary supplies may reopen for curbside pick-up and for delivery. Big box stores can reopen “closed areas,” like garden centers. And bike repair and maintenance can come back online. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the same time, the order will ease up on some restrictions on members of the public. It will, for example, allow motorized boating and golf (but no golf carts), consistent with sound social distancing. It will also permit individuals to travel between their residences, though such travel during the epidemic is strongly discouraged. And it will clarify that state parks remain open, as they have been throughout the emergency. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The governor’s actions today are in close alignment with other Midwest states. On April 16, Governor Whitmer announced that she and Governors Mike DeWine (OH), Tony Evers (WI), Tim Walz (MN), JB Pritzker (IL), Eric Holcomb (IN), and Andy Beshear (KY) will work in close coordination to reopen the economy in the Midwest region. The governor is committed to continuing to work closely with other governors to protect families and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. </p>

			<p>Governor Whitmer Extends, Expands “Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive Order to Save Lives</p>

<p>LANSING, Mich. -- Today, Governor Whitmer signed executive order 2020-42, extending her prior “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order through the end of April. As with the prior order, Executive Order 2020-42 limits gatherings and travel and requires all workers who are not necessary to sustain or protect life to stay home. Executive Order 2020-42 also imposes more stringent limitations on stores to reduce foot traffic, slow the spread of the coronavirus, and save lives.</p>

<p>“Michigan has the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country, and we’re still on the upswing. We must continue to do everything we can to slow the spread and protect our families,” said Governor Whitmer. “Data shows that most Michiganders are doing their part by staying home and staying safe. That’s good, but we must keep it up. When we do, we can save lives and shorten the amount of time we’re working through this crisis, which will be good for our families and good for our economy in the long-run. We can also protect critical infrastructure workers like doctors, nurses, grocery store employees, and child care workers. Now more than ever, it’s crucial that people stay home and stay safe.”</p>

<p>“It’s clear that staying home is the most effective way we can slow the spread of COVID-19 in Michigan,” said Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. “This aggressive action will help us protect more people and ease the strain on our health care system.”</p>

<p>Executive Order 2020-42 prohibits all businesses and operations from requiring workers to leave their homes, unless those workers are necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic operations. Businesses and operations are to designate the workers who meet those criteria, and must adopt social distancing practices and other mitigation measures to protect workers and patrons in the performance of that in-person work.</p>

<p>Workers who are necessary to sustain or protect life include those in health care and public health, law enforcement and public safety, grocery store workers, and more. For a full list of these critical infrastructure workers, click the link to Executive Order 2020-42 at the bottom of this page. To enable these critical workers to get to their workplaces, automobile dealerships will now be allowed to open for remote sales, though showrooms must remain closed.</p>

<p>Under the new order, all public and private gatherings among persons outside a single household remain temporarily prohibited. Though Michiganders may leave the house to get groceries or needed supplies, the new order encourages people to limit the number of household members running errands to the maximum extent possible. As before, people may engage in outdoor activities like walking, hiking, running, cycling, kayaking, canoeing, or any other recreational activity, consistent with remaining at least six feet from people from outside a person’s household and with other restrictions imposed by prior executive orders. The order clarifies, however, that travel for vacations or for any other purpose is prohibited.</p>

<p>A new section of the order imposes restrictions on stores in an effort to reduce crowds. Large stores must limit the number of people in the store at one time to no more than 4 customers for every 1,000 square feet of customer floor space; small stores must limit capacity to 25% of the total occupancy limits (including employees) under the fire codes. To regulate entry, stores must establish lines with markings for patrons to enable them to stand at least six feet apart from one another while waiting. Large stores must also close areas of the store that are dedicated to carpeting, flooring, furniture, garden centers, plant nurseries, or paint.</p>

<p>“This doesn’t mean everything will go back to normal on May 1,” Gov. Whitmer continued. “But based on the data we have right now, this is the appropriate window for an extension. It will take time to safely and responsibly re-open the economy, which is why we will continue to provide critical unemployment support and assistance to our small businesses during this challenging time. We will get through this if we all continue to do our part.”</p>

<p>All individuals who leave their home or place of residence must adhere to social distancing measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including remaining at least six feet from people from outside the individual’s household.</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>

<p>April 2, 2020</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Governor Whitmer Signs Executive Order Suspending Face-to-Face Learning at K-12 Schools for Remainder of School Year </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><em>Executive Order sets guidelines for remote learning, ensures teachers, school employees will be paid for remainder of school year</em></font></p>

<p><strong>LANSING, Mich.</strong> — Governor Gretchen Whitmer today signed Executive Order 2020-35, which orders all K-12 school buildings to close for the remainder of the school year — unless restrictions are lifted — and ensures continuing of learning by setting guidelines for remote learning. District facilities may be used by public school employees and contractors for the purposes of facilitating learning at a distance while also practicing social distancing.</p>

<p>“My number one priority right now is protecting Michigan families from the spread of COVID-19. For the sake of our students, their families, and the more than 100,000 teachers and staff in our state, I have made the difficult decision to close our school facilities for the remainder of the school year,” <strong>Governor Whitmer</strong> said. “As a parent, I understand the challenge closing schools creates for parents and guardians across the state, which is why we are setting guidelines for schools to continue remote learning and ensuring parents have resources to continue their children’s education from the safety of their homes. There is no video chat or homework packet that can replace the value of a highly trained, experienced teacher working with students in a classroom, but we must continue to provide equitable educational opportunities for students during this public health crisis.”</p>

<p>The Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators and the Michigan Council of Charter School Authorizers are currently developing a Continuity of Learning Plan template application for schools to utilize in order to create their localized plan. The application will be made available by April 3. District plans will need to detail how districts will provide opportunities for students to learn remotely and how schools will manage and monitor their progress. It will also provide information on how parents and guardians can learn more about the local plan. Each district must have its plan approved by their regional intermediate school district before being implemented. Public school academies must have their plans approved by their authorizer. Districts can also partner with one another to create joint plans.  </p>

<p>Every district’s plan will be different and will reflect what’s best and feasible for their community. A plan can include learning by any number of modes of instruction delivery, including a hybrid approach. However they are designed, districts must ensure their plans are appropriate, equitable and accessible for students and families.</p>

<p>If the plan relies on some online instruction, the district should ensure every student who needs it has access to an appropriate device with an ability to connect to the internet. Students and families will not be penalized if they are unable to participate in their alternate learning plan. </p>

<p>Schools should continue to provide mental health care services for students, to the extent possible, and should be ready and willing to help efforts to establish disaster relief childcare centers. School districts will also continue to provide meals for families who need them during the COVID-19 crisis. If any schools have unused personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies or other materials, they are allowed and encouraged to donate them to organizations that could put them to use.</p>

<p>School districts will have the flexibility to adopt a balanced calendar for the 2019-2020 school year and/or to begin the 2020-2021 school year before Labor Day without having to seek additional approval. Teachers and school employees will be paid for the remainder of the school year. Student teachers will still be able to get a temporary certification and current teachers will still be able to get their certifications renewed, even if they can’t meet all the requirements due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>All Michigan high school seniors will be given the opportunity to graduate this year so that they may make a successful postsecondary transition. Additionally, all standardized tests previously scheduled for the remainder of the school year, including the M-STEP and the SAT, will be canceled. There will be a date in October for rising high school seniors to take the SAT and for other high school students to take the PSAT.</p>

<p>Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus and CDC.gov/Coronavirus.</p>

			<p><b>Governor Whitmer Announces Statewide Closure of All K-12 School Buildings</b> </p>

<p><i>School building closures will last Monday, March 16 through Sunday, April 5</i> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>LANSING, Mich. -- </b>Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced that in order to slow the spread of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Michigan, she is ordering the closure of all K-12 school buildings, public, private, and boarding, to students starting Monday, March 16 until Sunday, April 5. School buildings are scheduled to reopen on Monday, April 6. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As of tonight, the number of presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Michigan is 12. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“This is a necessary step to protect our kids, our families, and our overall public health,” said Governor Whitmer<b>.</b> “I am working with partners across state government to ensure educators, parents, and students have the support they need during this time, and to ensure our children who rely on school for meals have access to food. I know this will be a tough time, but we’re doing this to keep the most people we can safe. I urge everyone to make smart choices during this time and to do everything they can to protect themselves and their families.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Closing our K-12 school buildings is the responsible choice that will minimize the risk of exposure for children, educators, and families and mitigate the spread of coronavirus,” said Michigan State Superintendent Michael Rice. “The Department of Education will continue to work closely with our partners in state government to help our students and educators in each school district get through this time. This is about protecting the most people in Michigan.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Governors across the country, including Mike DeWine (R-OH), Andy Beshear (D-KY), and Larry Hogan (R-MD), have taken similar steps to close schools and ensure the protection of children and families in their states. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Closing our school buildings is the smart thing and the right thing to do for the public’s health,” said Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. “These actions will help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Michigan. I will continue to work with Governor Whitmer and our four COVID-19 task forces to ensure we protect our children, our families, and our communities.”  </p>

<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">“We are taking the identification of COVID-19 in our state very seriously,” said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health. “We continue to urge Michiganders to take precautions to prevent the spread of this virus in our state.”</font></p>

<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">"This patient in Wayne County is currently under isolation. Our Public Health Division is working to identify individuals who may have come into close contact with the patient so we can take appropriate steps and monitor them closely,” said Wayne County Executive Warren C.

<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">“Oakland County and our Health Division will investigate the circumstances around this case so we understand if there are any potential close contacts," said Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter. "We must all as individuals and communities continue our prevention and preparedness strategies as we hope for a full recovery for this member of the community.”</font></p>

<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Local health departments will be working diligently to identify anyone who has come in close contact with these cases and recommend they be assessed for symptoms and monitored appropriately.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There are steps residents can take to prevent spread of flu and the common cold that will also help prevent coronavirus disease, including:</font></p>

	<li><font size="3">Covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing.</font></li>
	<li><font size="3">Avoiding contact with people who are sick.</font></li>

				<div class="fsElementContent">
			<p><strong>DATE</strong>: February 28, 2020</p>

<p><strong>TO</strong>: Local and Intermediate School District Superintendents, Public School Academy Directors, Nonpublic School Administrators, Public Health Officers, Public Library Directors</p>

<p><strong>FROM</strong>: Dr. Michael F. Rice, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Michigan Department of Education, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Chief Medical Executive and Chief Deputy for Health, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services</p>

<p><strong>SUBJECT</strong>: COVID-19 Updated Guidance</p>

<p>Currently, the State of Michigan has no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, but the state is closely monitoring the situation as knowledge evolves daily. Today, Governor Whitmer announced the activation of the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) where state, local, and federal agencies will coordinate statewide readiness and communication related to COVID-19. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) will continue actively preparing, monitoring, and coordinating response activities through the SEOC.</p>

<p>At this time, the health risk to the general public of Michigan from COVID-19 remains low, but schools and public libraries can take commonsense precautions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 appears to spread via respiratory transmission. Symptoms are similar to those of influenza (e.g., fever, cough, and shortness of breath). The current outbreak is occurring during a time of year when respiratory illnesses from influenza and other viruses are highly prevalent.</p>

<p>For schools, we all need to do what we can to keep students and staff engaged in the learning process while mitigating the spread of infections. We strongly recommend that schools and school districts partner with their local health departments to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Report influenza-like activity, absenteeism, and potential school dismissals.</li>
	<li>Educate students and the community about COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other recommendations for schools, public libraries, and public health agencies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Educating students, parents, library patrons, and staff regarding preventative hygiene practices including:
	<ul>
<li>Remain at home if you are sick and avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
		<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
		<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are unavailable.</li>
		<li>Cover cough with a tissue or sleeve. Provide adequate supplies within easy reach, including tissues and no-touch trash cans.</li>
		<li>Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Separate sick students and staff from others until they can go home. When feasible, identify a “sick room” through which others do not regularly pass.</li>
	<li>Examine existing contracts for any employee issues or stipulations if school is dismissed or if staff are asked to stay home if they are ill.</li>
	<li>Review school curriculum and ensure plans are adaptable and flexible to ensure the required hours of instruction are completed.</li>
	<li>Investigate how your meal programs and after-school programs may be affected if you have to dismiss a school in your district or cancel large gatherings of individuals for sporting events, concerts, or celebrations.</li>
	<li>Schools should engage directly with their local health departments in preparing parental communications.</li>
	<li>Encourage influenza vaccines to help avoid other seasonal respiratory illness.</li>
	<li>Review additional documentation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has developed guidance for child care programs, K-12 schools, and colleges/universities. Those documents are available at: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/guidance-for-schools.html" target="_blank"><u>cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/guidance-for-schools.html</u></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions to exclude a student or staff member, or to close schools altogether, must be taken on a case-by-case basis, in coordination with local health departments. These decisions are local in nature and could vary from district to district or school to school.</p>

<p>MDHHS has developed a COVID-19 website located at <a href="http://michigan.gov/coronavirus" target="_blank"><u>michigan.gov/coronavirus</u></a>. It is updated regularly with the most current available information. We encourage you to visit the website for tools to assist you with your preparations.</p>

<p>We will continue to share with you as more information becomes available. Thank you for all you do to keep Michigan schools and communities safe.</p>

			<p>April 24, 2020</p>

<p>Dear LOCS Families-</p>

<p>As we conclude another week in our COVID-19 world, I am pleased with our progress.</p>

<p>While respecting the state of Michigan’s executive orders to Stay Home and Stay Safe, our staff and families have adapted to our changing reality and found a rhythm.</p>

<p>I hope you were able to view <u><a href="https://youtu.be/uS1xqAr2VHI">my video message</a></u> last week about my pride in our LOCS and Orion community, thoughts shared by all of our administrators.</p>

<p>Today, I’d like to share a few updates on district-related programs and important information.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>STAY HOME ORDER</p>

<p>State of Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer <u><a href="https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90640-526896--,00.html">extended the state’s Stay Home order</a></u> for an additional two weeks, scheduled to expire on May 15.</p>

<p>She explained the restrictions will relax in a few areas, but none of those items directly impacted the school plans, so LOCS buildings and facilities remain closed as we abide by the state order.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PROGRAM REGISTRATIONS</p>

<p>We understand that many families would like to begin registering for programs. At this time, with the Stay Home order in place, our departments are only operating remotely. When that changes, we intend for the registrations to follow as we will have a better idea of what programs will be possible. Until then, all registrations are on hold. If alternative means are available, we will share that information.</p>

<p>There are many uncertainties with our programs and celebrations scheduled for the end of the school year. LOCS administrators are working to keep as many intact as possible, in whatever form is available. These are constant internal conversations, taking into account the health guidelines and we will share details on the programs as they are determined and adjusted.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>POWERSCHOOL</p>

<p>Earlier this month we shared that PowerSchool’s server was reset, changing our access links. We have updated them on our website and you can update your browser bookmark (<u><a href="https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/public/">https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/public/</a></u>). If you use the mobile app and are having any problems, please remove it and re-install it to ensure it is updated to the new server.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>MINDFULNESS</p>

<p>LOCS Mindfulness Instructor Stephanie Harris continues to produce three Mindfulness sessions each week, one for elementary students, one for teens and one for adults. Please embrace these free opportunities to calm and boost the mental health of you and your students. Featured on Fox 2 News this week, they are available to all residents in and out of the community at <u><a href="http://lakeorionschools.org/Mindfulness">LakeOrionSchools.org/Mindfulness</a></u>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>MEALS DISTRIBUTION</p>

<p>Pre-packaged meals continue to be distributed each Monday and Thursday for children in need. The meals are distributed from 11 a.m.-12 p.m. at Carpenter Elementary and the CERC Building, with the LOCS staff taking appropriate social distancing precautions in preparation and distribution. Each distribution contains a bag with enough meals to cover the span until the next distribution (i.e. Monday has 3 days of meals and Thursday has four days.) The meals are intended for children 18 years and under, as well as those with intellectual disabilities age 26 and younger.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ACADEMIC PLAN</p>

<p>The LOCS Continuity of Learning Academic Plan, approved by the state of Michigan’s guidelines, continues to offer lessons for LOCS students each week. The Home Learning Plans are distributed by Grades DK-8 teachers through email each Friday afternoon, as well as posted at <u><a href="http://lakeorionschools.org/HomeLearning">LakeOrionSchools.org/HomeLearning</a></u>. The high school plans are shared from teachers to students each Monday morning. More details about the high school plans are available at <u><a href="http://lakeorionschools.org/LOHS">LakeOrionSchools.org/LOHS</a></u>. Specific questions about the Grades 9-11 plans were also <u><a href="https://youtu.be/bkA1CoZlc5c">clarified in a video</a></u> from Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Heidi Mercer. Special Education students are contacted directly by their teachers. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>BOARD OF EDUCATION</p>

<p>The LOCS Board of Education has resumed its regular meeting schedule, in a virtual setting. As with their previous meetings in the board room, the meetings are live-streamed on ONTV’s website (<u><a href="https://orionontv.org/live-stream/">https://orionontv.org/live-stream/</a></u>) and broadcast on the Education Channel. They’re also archived for playback at any time (<u><a href="https://playback.orionontv.org/CablecastPublicSite/?channel=2" title="https://playback.orionontv.org/CablecastPublicSite/?channel=2">https://playback.orionontv.org/CablecastPublicSite/?channel=2</a>)</u>. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT SEARCH</p>

<p>The Board took action during a special meeting on Monday, April 20, to re-open the Superintendent Search. The next step will be reviewing applicants and narrowing the field to the interviewees at an upcoming closed-session meeting. Once the interviewees are determined, their names will be released publicly and public interview times will be shared so the public can view on the live-stream broadcast. All Superintendent Search details are available at <u><a href="http://lakeorionschools.org/SuptSearch">LakeOrionSchools.org/SuptSearch</a></u>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Our country and world are experiencing an ever-changing traumatic event and we are all doing our best to adapt daily. My thoughts go out to the families who have faced personal loss during this time and we hope to support you if we can. Please reach out to LOCS at <a href="mailto:communications@lok12.org">communications@lok12.org</a> if we can assist your family.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Please stay safe,</p>

<p>Marion Ginopolis</p>

<p>Superintendent, Lake Orion Community Schools</p>

			<p>Dear LOCS Families-</p>

<p>At the end of another week of our unexpected circumstances due to the COVID-19 virus, we all should be proud of how we’re handling the challenges, how we’re modifying our routines and how we’re embracing the adjustments.</p>

<p>While school buildings are closed for instruction through the remainder of the school year, the work of Lake Orion Community Schools rolls on, although in a different form.</p>

<p>We will continue to bring you these updates, both to remind that we are still connected to your children and your family as well as sharing the impressive work continuing among our staff.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ACADEMIC PLAN</p>

<p>Hopefully, your student found the upgraded Home Learning Plan this week and began finding a rhythm to complete the opportunities. LOCS staff members have created the plans tailored to each grade for DK-8, shared in emails to all students/families on Monday and also posted at <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/uJ7A9RyNUtwquxVWTUeL0w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgcexSP0QoaHR0cDovL0xha2VPcmlvblNjaG9vbHMub3JnL0hvbWVMZWFybmluZ1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAADSuJBeMGV7qVIVTWFyay5TbnlkZXJAbG9rMTIub3JnWAQAAAAB"><u>LakeOrionSchools.org/HomeLearning</u></a>. Students in Grades 9-12 will receive an email from their individual teachers on Monday and special education students also will be contacted by their teachers. Please check emails and the website link the morning of Monday, April 13 for the new week’s opportunities. </p>

<p>As the Teaching and Learning Department continues to process the state’s academic plan requirements, the plans will continue to evolve.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>STAY HOME, STAY SAFE ORDER</p>

<p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer extended the state’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order on Thursday, shifting the end to April 30. LOCS is making every effort to abide by the order, which requires all non-essential jobs to remain shut down. The order also instructs citizens to observe and follow appropriate social distancing polices and not gather with a group beyond those in an immediate household.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>LOCS BUILDINGS/FACILITIES CLOSED</p>

<p>Due to the Stay Home order, all LOCS buildings/fields/facilities are closed. That means all fields and playgrounds are off-limits to everyone. While many students and parents have inquired about retrieving items from the school buildings, due to the order, the buildings are closed until the order is lifted. When that occurs, LOCS will notify families of the process to enter buildings for specific items. Please do not try to enter schools or buildings at this time.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>MEALS DISTRIBUTION FOR CHILDREN IN NEED</p>

<p>Thanks to our wonderful Food Service and Transportation staff members, the meals distribution for children in need continues on the new schedule – Monday and Thursday from 11 a.m.-12 p.m. The same two sites, the CERC Building and Carpenter Elementary, are the locations for the orderly pick-up of meals, which last for the duration until the next pick-up date. Please remember, families are asked to pick up only at one site and only for children in need.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>BOARD MEETING</p>

<p>The LOCS Board of Education held its first remote board meeting on Wednesday afternoon to hear about the multitude of district-related issues during the school closure and discuss district business. The meeting was live-streamed on ONTV, is currently re-airing on the education channel and is available for on-demand replay at <a href="https://playback.orionontv.org/CablecastPublicSite/show/986?channel=2"><u>https://playback.orionontv.org/CablecastPublicSite/show/986?channel=2</u></a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELING</p>

<p>The LOCS counseling staff and Family School Coordinators at each school are available for student connection via email. Students can contact the counseling staff at their individual email addresses to set up an email exchange appointment. For families looking for some calming resources for their children and themselves, please check out our Mindfulness sessions posted three times each week at <a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/Mindfulness"><u>LakeOrionSchools.org/Mindfulness</u></a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As we continue to move forward, we are thinking of you and your families, especially as many are experiencing a holiday season. Please stay safe and reach out to us at <u><a href="mailto:communications@lok12.org">communications@lok12.org</a></u> if there is anything we can do or assist in finding help beyond our district roles.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

			<p>Dear Dragon Family,</p>

			<p>We hope this communication finds you and your family healthy. We are all in uncharted waters. The global pandemic is impacting every corner of our lives, which is hard not only on our children, but also us, as parents and educators. Learning remains our mission, so we in Lake Orion Community Schools will continue to find ways to enhance that, even from a distance.</p>

			<p>Based on our school closure extending through this school year, staff have been working hard to prepare remote learning opportunities for all of our students. As we get used to this “new normal,” we are asking for patience and understanding from all stakeholders. Although we want work to be rigorous and meaningful, we also do not want to overwhelm or add stress to our students and families. </p>

			<p>There is no replacing the interactions between teachers and students. But we can offer suggestions and supports to help our students stay engaged through this unprecedented disruption in their education.  Our intent is to offer flexible academic options for our students, understanding the family support varies, due to personal circumstances.   </p>

			<p> </p>

			<p><strong>Elementary</strong></p>

			<p>On Monday, April 6, parents of Grades DK-5 students will be receiving the first week’s activities.  These activities will be sent via email by your student’s teacher at 10:00 a.m. These activities will also be posted on our website. The plans will come out each Monday for the week. Students can work at their own pace and time. There will not be a specific scheduled time for elementary students to have to “attend class” via a video platform. All students across the district will be receiving the same activities, according to their grade level. There will be one template with all content areas and specials included, <u><a data-file-name="At_Home_Learning_Resources_Template_Elementary.pdf" href="/uploaded/Lake_Orion/Documents/Teaching_and_Learning/At_Home_Learning_--_Spring_2020/At_Home_Learning_Resources_Template_Elementary.pdf">see the attached document</a></u>. These activities are not required but strongly suggested. The Home Learning Resource Padlet that has been on the website will also continue to be available. Students can send their work/activities via email to teachers and teachers will provide feedback.  </p>

			<p> </p>

			<p><strong>Middle School</strong></p>

			<p>On Monday, April 6, parents of Grades 6-8 students will be receiving the first week’s activities. These activities will be sent via email by your student’s teacher/team at 10:00 a.m. These activities will also be posted on our website. The plans will come out each Monday for the week. Students can work at their own pace and time. There will not be a specific scheduled time for middle school students to have to “attend class” via a video platform. All students across the district will be receiving the same activities, according to their grade level. There will be one template with all content areas and elective classes included, <u><a data-file-name="At_Home_Learning_Resources_Template_Gr7.pdf" href="/uploaded/Lake_Orion/Documents/Teaching_and_Learning/At_Home_Learning_--_Spring_2020/At_Home_Learning_Resources_Template_Gr7.pdf">see the attached document</a></u>. These activities are not required but strongly suggested. The Home Learning Resource Padlet that has been on the website will also continue to be available. Students can send their work/activities via email to teachers and teachers will provide feedback. No standards-based grades will be given at this point.  </p>

			<p> </p>

			<p><strong>High School</strong></p>

			<p>On Monday, April 6 at 10:00 a.m., students will be receiving emails from each of their teachers with classwork. This classwork is not required at this point but strongly encouraged.  Students can send their work/activities via email to teachers and teachers will provide feedback. No grades will be given at this point.  </p>

			<p> </p>

			<p><strong>All Students</strong></p>

			<p>It is important to note that we are continuing to evolve our academic plan to best meet our students' needs. There may be changes to the plan as time progresses, such as grading of work and work being required especially at the high school level. We are currently reviewing the executive order from Governor Whitmer to ensure we meet all requirements. The district must submit a learning plan to our local intermediate school district. That template is not available currently. It is expected later today.  The district will then further work on the learning plan to ensure all requirements are met and submit the plan as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>We do not anticipate at any time for there to be required class times via Zoom or other internet-based platforms that students would need to engage with their teacher at a specific scheduled time of day for DK-8. We realize that many families are sharing devices and to stipulate a specific time would be difficult for many families.</p>

			<p>We continue to work on technology distribution. The district did conduct a survey. We are prioritizing based on need. We do not have enough devices for every family. In addition, Governor Whitmer’s executive order states that the learning plan cannot be 100% online. Our plan will have a variety of activities, all will not require a device. Below are a couple links for wi-fi:</p>

			<p>As always, thank you for your understanding and dedication in making the 2019-20 school year a success, regardless of the unprecedented situations we all face together. Please know that we take your child’s education seriously and are committed to doing the best we can to support your child both academically and social emotionally. As a reminder, there are many resources for parents and students on the Home Learning Resource Padlet that may help you support your child’s emotional and mental well-being during this time. We will get through this together! We are DRAGON strong!</p>

			<p>Dear LOCS Families:</p>

<p>At the end of another week of our school closure, I remain very proud of our staff, students and community members for their resiliency.</p>

<p>The twists and turns continue and everyone is adapting the best they can.</p>

<p>This week’s executive order from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stated that all school buildings will be closed through the rest of the 2019-20 school year. She detailed the need for remote learning during the continued school closure. While the requirements of her order are still being interpreted by administrators across the state, our team in Lake Orion Community Schools is already ahead of this process.</p>

<p>The district’s remote learning opportunities will launch next week, under the direction of Assistant Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Heidi Mercer and her team. They’ve spent numerous hours preparing for Monday’s launch and I have full confidence that it supports our students and their educational growth.</p>

<p>REMOTE ACADEMIC PLAN</p>

<p>The LOCS remote academic plan will begin on Monday, April 6, 2020. The K-8 plan will be distributed in two ways: via teachers directly through emails to parents and it will be posted on LakeOrionSchools.org. High school staff will communicate directly with the students. Rest assured, there will not be specific times in which students will be required to complete their work. More specific information will be shared in a district-wide communication on Friday, April 3.</p>

<p>ONLINE AWARENESS</p>

<p>With families remaining home during the stay at home order from Gov. Whitmer, online time has likely increased within your homes. Now, more than ever, we ask that parents be vigilant in protecting their children’s online privacy and be aware of their online interactions.</p>

<p>The remote conferencing platforms (Zoom, GoToMeeting, WebEx, Google Hangouts) are wonderful communication tools, but all have vulnerabilities as well. Please remind students to act and dress appropriately when in front of the camera, do not accept online invitations from anyone unknown and not to share information with anyone they do not know.</p>

<p>Parents, please make your best effort to monitor what sites and tools your students are using and ask them not to record or take photos of the screen when anyone else is visible. Under no circumstances should they share an online group conference photo or screen on social media, due to the privacy concerns of the other children on screen.</p>

<p>POWERSCHOOL UPDATE</p>

<p>PowerSchool will be updated and available by the end of the week. The website links have changed for all staff, students and parents. But usernames and passwords remain the same.</p>

<p>New link for Parents and Students: <u><a href="https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/public/home.html" target="_blank" title="https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/public/home.html">https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/public/home.html</a></u></p>

<p>Teachers: <u><a href="https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/teachers/pw.html" target="_blank" title="https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/teachers/pw.html">https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/teachers/pw.html</a></u></p>

<p>Administrators:  <u><a href="https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/admin/pw.html" target="_blank">https://lakeorion.powerschool.com/admin/pw.html</a></u></p>

<p>The links are also updated on the LOCS website (<u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/Resources" target="_blank">LakeOrionSchools.org/Resources</a></u>).</p>

<p>The PowerSchool mobile app login remains the same. If a parent/student has a problem with the app, remove it and reinstall. The app’s LOCS district code is ZWXF.</p>

<p>BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING</p>

<p>The LOCS Board of Education will hold its regularly scheduled meeting on April 8, with a few modifications for the current situation. The meeting will be held remotely, at 2 p.m., with all board members and LOCS administrators participating via a remote platform. The community will be able to watch the meeting on the usual ONTV livestream: <u><a href="https://orionontv.org/live-stream">https://orionontv.org/live-stream</a></u></p>

<p>MEAL DISTRIBUTION UPDATE</p>

<p>LOCS will continue to distribute meals to all children in the community ages 18 and younger. The distribution schedule will shift slightly beginning Monday, April 6, as meal distributions will be held only on Monday (three days of meals) and Thursday (four days of meals.)  We will still have our planned distribution this Friday, April 3. The distribution will continue at the same locations (CERC and Carpenter Elementary) and remain from 11 a.m.-12 p.m. on each of the two days.</p>

<p>In closing, there are many unknowns based on the executive order that will have to be examined in the coming days, so we don’t have all the answers yet. But as we finalize them, I will continue to keep you informed.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding in our evolving world.</p>

<p>Marion Ginopolis, Superintendent</p>

<p>Dear LOCS Families-</p>

<p>We’ve progressed through another week few could have imagined and I’m so impressed with our community. Seeing our students’ creativity at home, our teachers’ remote collaboration and our staff and Board of Education trustees assisting with meals inspires me.</p>

<p>The Orion community, in and around our district, encourages me daily in this process. Each week, I participate in group online meetings with the leaders of the Orion area and the way our community rallies, helping those who need it and understanding the severity of the situation, is rare among cites and townships.</p>

<p>These experiences and seeing your social media sharing remind me why I have enjoyed my time in LOCS over the past decade and it heartens me for when we reach the other side of this trying time.</p>

<p>SCHOOL CLOSURE</p>

<p>Though Governor Gretchen Whitmer made a public statement on Friday about her expectation for the school schedule, I would like to remind our families that nothing is definitive. I am aware of her comments, but my understanding is that a conclusive answer will come in the future, not today. As we have previously, LOCS will inform you when we have an official notice of the plans beyond the April 13 expiration of the stay-at-home order.</p>

<p>POWERSCHOOL</p>

<p>Due to a previously planned server update, families and staff members will not be able to access Powerschool next week, March 29 through at least April 3<a dir="ltr" href="x-apple-data-detectors://4" x-apple-data-detectors="true" x-apple-data-detectors-result="4" x-apple-data-detectors-type="calendar-event">.</a> LOCS will send out an email with more information once it is up and running again.</p>

<p>FIELDS, BUILDINGS, FACILITIES CLOSED</p>

<p>LOCS buildings, fields and facilities are closed to the public. As the district complies with the state of Michigan’s stay-at-home order, the goal is to avoid public gatherings. By having our fields and buildings closed, that is one significant way to assist that process.</p>

<p>MINDFULNESS</p>

<p>Thanks to our LOCS Mindfulness expert, Stephanie Harris, students and parents in our district have an opportunity to ease their anxiety in this time of need. She is producing short videos to be released once each week for three different groups – one for our middle and high school students on Mondays, one for adults on Wednesdays and one for elementary students on Fridays – as an opportunity to help community members cope. The videos are available on our Mindfulness page: <u><a href="https://www.lakeorionschools.org/resources/mindfulness" target="_blank" title="https://www.lakeorionschools.org/resources/mindfulness">https://www.lakeorionschools.org/resources/mindfulness</a></u>.</p>

<p>HOME LEARNING</p>

<p>The Teaching and Learning Department has spent the recent weeks creating the next phase of home learning for our students. Following spring break, the LOCS educational program will evolve. Using remote learning capabilities, students will connect with teachers in a designed program with more specific materials than the current padlet. While the padlet will still be available and updated for supplementary resources, teachers will be reaching out with grade and class-specific lessons. More details will be sent to families prior to April 6<a dir="ltr" href="x-apple-data-detectors://6" x-apple-data-detectors="true" x-apple-data-detectors-result="6" x-apple-data-detectors-type="calendar-event">.</a></p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT SEARCH</p>

<p>The LOCS Board of Education has suspended the Superintendent Search process during the school closure. President Jim Weidman's letter to the community is available for more details:  <u><a href="https://www.lakeorionschools.org/board-of-education/superintendent-search" target="_blank" title="https://www.lakeorionschools.org/board-of-education/superintendent-search">https://www.lakeorionschools.org/board-of-education/superintendent-search</a></u>.</p>

<p>FOOD</p>

<p>The LOCS meals distribution program will continue moving forward on the Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule from 11 a.m.-12 p.m<a dir="ltr" href="x-apple-data-detectors://9" x-apple-data-detectors="true" x-apple-data-detectors-result="9" x-apple-data-detectors-type="calendar-event">.</a> at the CERC building and Carpenter Elementary site. The process is extremely efficient with our food service, transportation, and administrative staff all playing a role while respecting social distancing. We would like to thank those families who have picked up food for their orderly and respectful understanding of the procedures.</p>

<p>SOCIAL MEDIA  </p>

<p>Twitter: If you don't already have a twitter account, you may want to sign up so that you can receive very current information from me and from the district. If you need help setting up a Twitter account, email <u><a href="mailto:communications@lok12.org" target="_blank">communications@lok12.org</a></u> and we can send you instructions. To follow me: @marionginopolis. To follow the district @LKOrionSchools.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Marion Ginopolis</p>

<p>LOCS families –</p>

<p>As we enter the second week of the COVID-19 school closure, we wanted to reach out and keep connecting with you. We miss seeing your students in person, so we hope you will continue to reach out on social media to share the adventures and experiences everyone is embracing in their adjusted home life.</p>

<p>The serious nature of our society’s shift continues to intensify and we want to be a resource for families and students who need help. If there are circumstances you feel are weighing down your family or children, please reach out to us confidentially at <u><a href="mailto:communications@lok12.org">communications@lok12.org</a></u> and we will try to find assistance wherever we can.</p>

<p>We are keeping in close touch with Orion community leaders as well and we have a strong belief that working together is an essential component in unusual times.</p>

<p>Today, we have a few topical updates to share:</p>

<p><strong>STATE ORDER: STAY HOME</strong></p>

<p>Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer issued a three-week “stay home” order for the state of Michigan for all citizens, with only essential personnel considered exceptions. The order details were announced earlier today. Because the order extends until April 13, the school closure will continue until at least that point.</p>

<p><strong>HOME LEARNING</strong></p>

<p>When LOCS returns to its home learning on April 6, following spring break, the LOCS educational program will evolve. Using remote learning capabilities, students will connect with teachers in a designed program with more specific materials than the current padlet. While the padlet will still be available and updated for supplementary resources, teachers will be reaching out with grade and class-specific lessons. More details will come prior to April 6.</p>

<p><strong>STATE ASSESSMENTS</strong></p>

<p>The annual M-STEP state assessment testing will likely be waived for this year. The state of Michigan applied for a waiver to be released from those assessment tests this year and it was granted by the federal government on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>MINDFULNESS</strong></p>

<p>Our LOCS mindfulness expert, Oakview Middle School teacher Stephanie Harris, is preparing short resources for our students to embrace and ease their anxiety in this time of need.</p>

<p>The short videos will be released once each week – one for our Grade K-6 students and one for our Grade 7-12 students – as an opportunity to help them cope.</p>

<p>Ms. Harris is also working on a presentation to support adults and we will share more information about that when it is finalized.</p>

<p><strong>MEALS</strong></p>

<p>The first week of meal pick-up went smoothly at the CERC building and Carpenter Elementary. The LOCS Food Service workers, Transportation staff, Safe-Ed employees and a few administrators were wonderful participants, providing meals for the community’s children.</p>

<p>LOCS will continue the program on Wednesday, March 25, from 11 a.m.-12 p.m. at the same sites -- the CERC building (455 E. Scripps Road) and Carpenter Elementary (2290 Flintridge) – with meals for all children 18 and younger.</p>

<p><strong>BUILDINGS CLEANED</strong></p>

<p>After closing the LOCS buildings for six full days to allow any strains of the virus to die off a hard surface, the schools are scheduled to be disinfected this week by the cleaning crews. That is an extensive process that will take much of the week and prepare the building for when our students and staff members return.</p>

<p><strong>KINDERGARTEN REGISTRATION POSTPONED</strong></p>

<p>The Kindergarten Registration Day previously scheduled for this week is postponed indefinitely. Please share that information with family, friends and neighbors who were planning to attend, as they are not in our School Messenger system. LOCS will widely announce a rescheduled date when it is available.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Marion Ginopolis</p>

<p>Superintendent</p>

<p>Lake Orion Community Schools</p>

			<p>Dear LOCS Families –</p>

<p>Hopefully your families are staying safe as the COVID-19 school closure continues.</p>

<p>Lake Orion Community Schools will continue to reach out with information on a regular basis, as developments emerge.</p>

<p>Today, we wanted to share just a few items.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>MEALS</strong></p>

<p>The first day of meal pick-up (Wednesday, March 18) went smoothly at the CERC building and Carpenter Elementary. The LOCS Food Service workers, Transportation staff and Safe-Ed employees did a great job providing meals for the community and handling a process that was brand new to everyone.</p>

<p>LOCS will continue the program on Friday, March 20, from 11 a.m.-12 p.m. at the same sites -- the CERC building (455 E. Scripps Road) and Carpenter Elementary (2290 Flintridge) – with meals for all children 18 and younger. Because it is a Friday, there will be meals provided to last through the weekend, until Monday’s distribution.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>COMMUNITY INTERACTION</strong></p>

<p>As stated in national briefings, the recommendation is to keep gatherings to under 10 people to help flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Nationally and regionally, that has involved various group events being canceled.</p>

<p>Locally, we want to remind families that should extend to avoiding playdates and sleepovers.</p>

<p>We understand it is challenging to have children at home with only their family members for extended periods of time, but we are all following these recommendations for the greater community result and hopefully a quicker resumption of our usual lives.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>HOME LEARNING RESOURCES</strong></p>

<p>LOCS takes seriously the mission of educating every student every day while in the classroom. We also take special care regarding our students emotionally. </p>

<p>The LOCS academic plan is built on the foundation that we cannot replicate the classroom experience and we are trying to minimize student and family stress. </p>

<p>All resources are optional and designed to offer students the chance to enjoy learning, at their own pace and discretion.</p>

<p>LOCS also recognizes that our teachers need to take care of their own families during this time.</p>

<p>The information we receive regarding the situation changes frequently and our administration is processing and adapting to it as it shifts. Our Teaching and Learning staff members meet in a virtual setting every day to discuss the programs.</p>

<p><u><a href="https://padlet.com/loteachingandlearning/j1jg1u0i2qv3">The padlet</a></u> is our academic plan through April 5. We are facing two weeks of lost instruction time. The third week (March 30-April 3) is our scheduled spring break. If the district is required to remain closed after April 5, further details will be provided.</p>

<p>Teachers will not assign new classwork through April 5.</p>

<p>All Home Learning Resources on the padlet are linked on the front page of each school’s website.</p>

<p>There are many areas children can grow during this time that are just as valuable as core content. Students may learn to cook, work around the house, write a letter, practice filling out a job application, interviewing skills, create a resume, enjoy the outdoors, among other opportunities.</p>

<p>For those looking for more specific information about the LOCS curriculum for your student’s grade level, check out the curriculum pages: <u><a href="https://www.lakeorionschools.org/teaching-and-learning/curriculum">https://www.lakeorionschools.org/teaching-and-learning/curriculum</a></u></p>

<p>Please be sure that you are staying in tune with your child’s emotional state. This is a very unsettling time and your child’s mental well-being should come first over academic learning.  </p>

<p>If a family has more questions about the Home Learning Resources, there is an <u><a href="https://www.lakeorionschools.org/teaching-and-learning/padlet-resources/learning-resources-faq">LOCS Frequently Asked Questions</a></u> page addressing many of those.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>PHYSICAL HEALTH</strong></p>

<p>The health and safety of LOCS students remains a high priority and, even away from the LOCS buildings, remaining vigilant about health is essential.</p>

<p>As Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said, mitigation of the virus is the reason for closing schools and that should remain foremost in everyone’s thoughts during the period away from school as well.</p>

<p>Please monitor students and all others in their families for any signs of compromised health.</p>

<p>Oakland County has set up an Emergency Hotline for COVID-19 (248-858-1000).</p>

<p>It is important for families to be aware of the signs of the virus and to report to a health official if symptoms indicate concern of the situation.</p>

<p>Patients with confirmed infection have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Cough</li>
	<li>Shortness of breath </li>
</ul>
<p>The precautions and recommendations from state health officials remain in place.</p>

<ul>
<li>The best prevention for viruses, such as influenza, the common cold or COVID-19 is to: </li>
	<li>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.   </li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing.   </li>
	<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>If you are sick, stay home, and avoid contact with others.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>MENTAL HEALTH</strong></p>

<p>With such a significant disruption, students may be confused or struggling to process the extreme events of the recent days and weeks.</p>

<p>There are many resources available from reputable organizations to address anxiety and explain the virus, as well as the process unfolding. We have posted a number of these on the <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus">LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus</a></u> page.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Our LOCS students and families remain in our thoughts, even as they are away from the buildings during this required closure.</p>

<p>LOCS will continue to share information as it evolves and is pertinent to our students and staff.</p>

<p>Resources continue to be updated on the <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus">LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus</a></u> page, day by day.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Marion Ginopolis</p>

<p>Superintendent, Lake Orion Community Schools</p>

			<p>Dear LOCS Families-</p>

<p>This is an unprecedented time in our country battling the COVID-19 coronavirus and, like all of you, we are trying to make the best decisions for everyone, particularly the Lake Orion Community Schools students.</p>

<p>As we all adjust our current reality, we will try to keep you informed as we acquire more information.</p>

<p>Thank you for those who entered the buildings briefly Monday to retrieve necessary student personal items. It was an efficient process and reminded of our community’s understanding of the circumstances.</p>

<p>This update shares information about the Home Learning Resources, the food distribution plan, wireless connectivity, building access and the LOCS communication channels.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>HOME LEARNING RESOURCES</strong></p>

<p>LOCS takes seriously the mission of educating every student every day while in the classroom.  We also take special care regarding our students emotionally.  The following plan is built on the foundation that we cannot replicate the classroom experience and we are trying to minimize student and family stress. All resources are optional and designed to offer students the chance to enjoy learning, at their own pace and discretion. </p>

<p>LOCS also recognizes that our teachers need to take care of their own families during this time.  In addition, the information we receive regarding the situation changes frequently.  We are doing the best we can with the information. </p>

<ul>
<li>Please be sure that you are staying in tune with your child’s emotional state. This is a very unsettling time and your child’s mental well-being should come first over academic learning.  </li>
	<li>
<a href="https://padlet.com/loteachingandlearning/j1jg1u0i2qv3"><u>The padlet</u></a> is our academic plan through April 5. We are dealing with two weeks of lost instruction time. The third week is our scheduled spring break. If the district is required to remain closed after April 5, further details will be provided.</li>
	<li>Teachers will not assign new classwork through April 5.</li>
	<li>There are many things that children can learn during this time that are just as valuable as core content.  This is an opportunity where students may learn to cook, work around the house, write a letter, practice filling out a job application, interviewing skills, create a resume, enjoy the outdoors, among other opportunities.</li>
	<li>All learning resources are linked on the front page of each school’s website.</li>
	<li>LOCS continues to monitor end of the marking period dates. Lake Orion High School exams will be postponed. No new dates have been set.</li>
	<li>State standardized testing (M-STEP, PSAT/SAT) remains suspended, while grad requirements, make up of instructional time and AP testing will be communicated at some point in the future.</li>
	<li>For those looking for more specific information about the LOCS curriculum for your student’s grade level, check out the curriculum pages: <u><a href="https://www.lakeorionschools.org/teaching-and-learning/curriculum">https://www.lakeorionschools.org/teaching-and-learning/curriculum</a></u>.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>FOOD DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>

<p>LOCS established a food distribution plan for all children 18 years old and younger, regardless of their school or the community where they live. Meals will be available Monday, Wednesday and Fridays from 11 a.m.-12 p.m. at the CERC Building (455 E. Scripps Road) and Carpenter Elementary (2290 Flintridge.) </p>

<p>The distribution will begin this Wednesday, March 18.</p>

<p>Packaged breakfast and lunch will be available for enough days until the next pick-up appointment. Parents may pick up meals for their children, without the children present.</p>

<p>A flyer detailing the pickup details is available at <a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/FoodService"><u>LakeOrionSchools.org/FoodService</u></a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY</strong></p>

<p>With many residents remaining home as they practice social distancing, Internet access remains a priority.</p>

<p>Comcast shared information on Monday, with a few offers.</p>

<p>From the press release: Xfinity WiFi hotspots across the country will be available to anyone who needs them for free – including non-Xfinity Internet subscribers. For a map of Xfinity WiFi hotspots, visit <a href="http://www.xfinity.com/wifi"><u>www.xfinity.com/wifi</u></a>. Once at a hotspot, consumers should select the “xfinitywifi” network name in the list of available hotspots, and then launch a browser.</p>

<p>New customers will receive 60 days of complimentary Internet Essentials service, which is normally available to all qualified low-income households for $9.95/month.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>BUILDING ACCESS/CLEANING</strong></p>

<p>With COVID-19 spreading, cleaning the facilities is critical.</p>

<p>To accomplish that in the most effective manner, the buildings will be closed from Tuesday, March 17-Sunday, March 22, to all personnel, public and LOCS staff members. </p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control shared that the virus can live up to three days on a hard surface. As a precaution, the district will close all buildings for twice that long, six full days, to ensure any potential remnants of the virus are eliminated.</p>

<p>Beginning the week of March 23 and continuing the week of March 30, the cleaning crews will disinfect the buildings, technology and school buses with only limited access to certain LOCS staff members.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>PHYSICAL HEALTH</strong></p>

<p>The health and safety of LOCS students remains a high priority and, even away from the LOCS buildings, remaining vigilant about health is essential.</p>

<p>As Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said, mitigation of the virus is the reason for closing schools and that should remain foremost in everyone’s thoughts during the period away from school as well.</p>

<p>Please monitor students and all others in their families for any signs of compromised health.</p>

<p>Oakland County has set up an Emergency Hotline for COVID-19 (248-858-1000).</p>

<p>It is important for families to be aware of the signs of the virus and to report to a health official if symptoms indicate concern of the situation.</p>

<p>Patients with confirmed infection have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Cough</li>
	<li>Shortness of breath </li>
</ul>
<p>The precautions and recommendations from state health officials remain in place.</p>

<p>The best prevention for viruses, such as influenza, the common cold or COVID-19 is to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.   </li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing.   </li>
	<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>If you are sick, stay home, and avoid contact with others.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>MENTAL HEALTH</strong></p>

<p>With such a significant disruption, students may be confused or struggling to process the extreme events of the recent days and weeks.</p>

<p>There are many resources available from reputable organizations to address anxiety and explain the virus, as well as the process unfolding. We have posted a number of these on the <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus">LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus</a></u> page.</p>

<p>Our LOCS students and families remain in our thoughts, even as they are away from the buildings during this required closure.</p>

<p>LOCS will continue to share information as it evolves and is pertinent to our students and staff.</p>

<p>Resources continue to be updated on the <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus">LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus</a></u> page, day by day and often hour by hour.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>

<p>Please rely on official sources of communication to obtain information about the district’s intentions and plans.</p>

<p>The LakeOrionSchools.org website and social media channels will be monitored and updated as usual during the school closure. If there is a pressing matter, please contact the district at <u><a href="mailto:communications@lok12.org">communications@lok12.org</a></u>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thank you for your patience during this uncertainty. Even as your students are away from our classrooms, we know they are growing in the world and learning in many unseen ways. We look forward to having them back in our schools and all of us together as soon as it is safe.</p>

<p>I wish the best for you and your families in this period of time.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Marion Ginopolis</p>

<p>Superintendent, Lake Orion Community Schools</p>

			<p>Dear LOCS Families-</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>In these unique times amid the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the Lake Orion Community Schools administrative team is working day and night to live up to our promise to provide the best education and support for our students.</p>

<p>With the closure of all LOCS schools through at least April 5, that promise extends beyond the traditional learning environment and today our administrators worked to address many of the questions from our community.</p>

<p>This communication will address many of those topics and, as with all communications, will be posted at <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org">LakeOrionSchools.org</a></u>.</p>

<p>With rapidly-changing events and declarations, please remember to rely only on LOCS official district channels for pertinent school-related information.</p>

<p>School Messenger’s email/text/phone is the official direct communication tool, as well as the website <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org">LakeOrionSchools.org</a></u> and the district social media sites.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>ACCESS</strong></p>

<p>The LOCS school facilities will be open on Monday, March 16 from 8:30 a.m.-2 p.m. for students to retrieve any necessary personal items, including individual medication, needed for the duration of the closure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Following Monday’s opportunity, the facilities will be closed to the public for an indefinite period of time, so students and staff are asked to remove everything necessary.</li>
	<li>On Monday, staff members will be in their classrooms, secretaries will be in the office and administrators will be available in the buildings from 8:30 a.m.-2 p.m. as a resource for students and parents.</li>
	<li>LOCS buildings will close at 2 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>CLEANING</strong></p>

<p>With COVID-19 spreading, cleaning the facilities is critical.</p>

<ul>
<li>To accomplish that in the most effective manner, the buildings will be closed from Tuesday, March 17-Sunday, March 22, to all personnel, public and LOCS staff members.

</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</strong></p>

<p>LOCS takes seriously the mission of educating every student every day while in the classroom.</p>

<ul>
<li>During this unprecedented period, LOCS will offer home learning resources and activities, but there will be no mandatory academic work. We cannot replicate the classroom experience. We are trying to minimize student and family stress. All resources are optional and designed to offer students the chance to enjoy learning, at their own pace and discretion.</li>
	<li>The Home Learning Resources are available in a document attached to this email and also will be linked from <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus">LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus</a></u>.</li>
	<li>The two pages feature a <u><a href="https://padlet.com/loteachingandlearning/j1jg1u0i2qv3">padlet of external academic resources</a></u> (password: Dragons) and enjoyable learning opportunities for students.</li>
	<li>All of these resources are not part of the graded curriculum and are only offered as an option for students while away from school.</li>
	<li>Virtual learning students will continue as scheduled and connect with their mentor about the next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>

<p>LOCS will not be providing devices or home Internet access to students during this period.</p>

<p>For those seeking discounted Internet access, there is a potential resource at <u><a href="https://www.internetessentials.com/covid19">https://www.internetessentials.com/covid19</a></u> and families can contact their mobile phone provider for other options.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>FOOD</strong></p>

<p>LOCS will not be offering food service to any student during the week of March 16-20.</p>

<ul>
<li>Decisions about food service for the following weeks will be made at a later date and time and be communicated, if available.</li>
	<li>Blessings in a Backpack recipients will be able to accept their food on Monday, March 16, at their school during the 8:30 a.m.-2 p.m. visiting opportunity.</li>
	<li>Community resources for local food banks are located on the LOCS website at <u><a href="http://LakeOrionSchools.org/FoodService">LakeOrionSchools.org/FoodService</a></u>.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>EVENTS/SCHEDULE</strong></p>

<p>All events in and out of the district associated in any way with LOCS students, staff and facilities will not occur.</p>

<ul>
<li>In most cases, those are cancellations. Should there be a rescheduled event, such as the Kindergarten Registration Day, that information will be communicated as soon as a new date is secured.</li>
	<li>The lone exception to the schedule is the LOCS Bond construction work, which is contracted to continue outdoors on the existing sites.</li>
	<li>Potential refunds for any events, if appropriate, will be addressed at a later time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The extended calendar and potential resumption of school remains undetermined. Those decisions involve multiple entities, including federal and state governments and health organizations, in addition to LOCS.</p>

<p>As soon as it is appropriate to share a resumption date, LOCS will communicate to the community.</p>

			<p>Dear LOCS Families-</p>

<p>Late Tuesday night, the first presumptive positive cases of the coronavirus COVID-19 in the state of Michigan were announced by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

<p>She shared that they remain presumptive cases, still to be confirmed by the national Centers for Disease Control, but the state is operating as if they are positive based on testing at the state lab in Lansing.</p>

<p>Though it was mentioned that one case is in Oakland County and one is in Wayne County, no more specific details or locations were provided.</p>

<p>At this time, Lake Orion Community Schools will remain in session.</p>

<p>Until we get further guidance from Gov. Whitmer and the Oakland County Health Division, the following measures are being enacted by LOCS.</p>

<p>For the immediate future, the following are being suspended:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building rentals</li>
	<li>All field trips, activities and events outside the district</li>
	<li>All middle school athletic competitions, including the Oakland County middle school wrestling tournament on Saturday</li>
	<li>All LOCS Enrichment Services/Community Education classes, including Saturday’s mom-to-mom sale at CERC</li>
	<li>All parent-teacher conferences</li>
	<li>All large-group activities</li>
</ul>
<p>The district will defer to the MHSAA regarding those high school athletic competitions and, <u><a href="https://twitter.com/MHSAA/status/1237769209955979266?s=20">currently, those are proceeding</a></u>. Athletic practices will continue for the time being.</p>

<p>The following events remain on as scheduled:</p>

<ul>
<li>SACC (School Age Child Care)</li>
	<li>GAP/Elementary enrichment programs</li>
	<li>Mini-Daze camps at CERC March 13 and March 19</li>
</ul>
<p>LOCS will continue to reassess as events warrant.</p>

<p>Unless there is information that the LOCS community is directly affected, our staff and students will continue to take great care of their hygiene, while the district custodial staff will remain vigilant in the cleaning processes.</p>

<p>The same requests remain, as previously shared: sick students should remain home and be examined by a medical professional if any of the virus warning signs are apparent. When healthy students and staff are in school, they should continue to follow proper hygiene and wash hands with increased frequency.</p>

<p>The web page for information and trusted sources remains active at <u><a href="http://lakeorionschools.org/coronavirus">LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus</a></u>. Governor Whitmer’s press release from Tuesday night is currently posted on the page.</p>

<p>LOCS remains focused on best practices to keep students safe and provide the best education every day.</p>

<p>Updates will be shared as appropriate.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Update on the coronavirus in Michigan</p>

<p>Governor Gretchen Whitmer created a task force “to combat the spread of coronavirus and assess the impact it may have on Michiganders’ day-to-day lives. The task force includes K-12 and university/college education, which will be a significant consideration as the state assesses the response and oversight.</p>

<p>“While there have been no confirmed cases in Michigan yet, we must recognize that this virus has the potential to impact nearly every aspect of our lives,” Governor Whitmer said in a released statement. “From our public schools, colleges, and universities to our businesses and hospitals, we must harness all of the resources we have to ensure we can prevent the spread of coronavirus and keep Michiganders safe. This is a strong, smart team that will make protecting our public health their number one priority and work closely with me to protect the people of our state.”</p>

<p>Within the district, the school and classroom cleanings continue.</p>

<p>Students and staff are encouraged to continue hand-washing whenever possible. The LOCS elementary schools have sinks and those are being used for students to wash their hands. Though hand sanitizer in every classroom is not immediately achievable due to the shortages, the district is making every effort to procure as many as possible as soon as they become available. The current dispensers are being converted to the alcohol-base when available. Spray bottles in the classroom are also being filled with disinfectant.</p>

<p>LOCS continues to make every effort to monitor the virus and, currently, that involves everyone in the schools and buildings practicing proper hygiene.</p>

<p>The district will continue to post updates on this page, including resources for parents to share with their children to help explain the situation.</p>

			<p>Dear LOCS Families-</p>

<p>We are reaching out today to share Lake Orion Community Schools’ focus on the coronavirus (COVID-19) and district’s oversight as the virus spreads wider throughout the world and the United States.</p>

<p>LOCS’ goal is to keep our students as safe as possible and, at the current point, much of that centers around education and a proactive approach about the virus.</p>

<p>LOCS has created a webpage (<u><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/vaQvqYlFiZEonH1JQEFxrg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgPpZaP0QnaHR0cDovL0xha2VPcmlvblNjaG9vbHMub3JnL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAANpiXV64KEkgUhVNYXJrLlNueWRlckBsb2sxMi5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" title="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/vaQvqYlFiZEonH1JQEFxrg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgPpZaP0QnaHR0cDovL0xha2VPcmlvblNjaG9vbHMub3JnL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAANpiXV64KEkgUhVNYXJrLlNueWRlckBsb2sxMi5vcmdYBAAAAAE~">LakeOrionSchools.org/coronavirus</a></u>) to contain relevant and appropriately sourced information. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Oakland County Health Division are the reputable organizations regarding the virus and updates. Those sites are linked off the LOCS coronavirus page and are continuously updated with the latest news for the general public.</p>

<p>At the district level, we have increased our focus on educating students and staff about the best ways to remain healthy.</p>

<ul>
<li>The CDC passed along information for K-12 school districts, including: “staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often.”</li>
	<li>Handwashing is a particular emphasis, specifically “washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The LOCS custodial staff has taken increased measures with the building cleanings during this period of heightened sensitivity. Large bottles of hand sanitizer will be placed in every classroom, while every student desk, table and community shared area will be regularly wiped down, as well as door knobs and frequently touched areas. All of these actions are to reinforce the importance of cleanliness and hygiene.</p>

<p>As the coronavirus progresses, the district will continue to monitor changes and update the web page accordingly.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>LOCS Administration</p>

	<li>All of these resources are not part of the graded curriculum and are only offered as an option for students while away from school.</li>
	<li>Virtual learning students will continue as scheduled and connect with their mentor about the next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this unprecedented period, LOCS will offer home learning resources and activities, but there will be no mandatory academic work. We cannot replicate the classroom experience. We are trying to minimize student and family stress. All resources are optional and designed to offer students the chance to enjoy learning, at their own pace and discretion.</p>
