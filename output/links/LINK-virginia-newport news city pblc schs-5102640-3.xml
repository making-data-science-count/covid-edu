            <p class="mb-1_5"><strong><a href="#faq13" data-cfw="collapse">What is the learning plan for middle and high school students?</a></strong></p>
            <div id="faq13" class="mb-1 collapse">
              <p>On April 20, 2020, middle and high school students will begin the fourth  quarter marking period (MP4) with a new At-Home Virtual Learning Plan for the  remainder of the school year.  The plan  includes the continuation of learning with opportunities for students to think  creatively and learn using a variety of innovative online tools and resources.  Teacher prepared lessons align with the Virginia Standards of Learning;  therefore, it is the expectation that students participate and complete  assignments, so that they are prepared for the next phase (grade, level,  course) of their academic journey.</p>

            <p class="mb-1_5"><strong><a href="#faq13a" data-cfw="collapse">Is instructional support available for students with disabilities and English learners?</a></strong></p>
            <div id="faq13a" class="mb-1 collapse">
<p>
	<strong>Instructional Support for Students with Disabilities</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The Special Education Department is working to assist teachers with
	supporting small group instruction virtually. Collaborative teachers should
	plan with general education teachers to organize differentiated, small
	group instruction. A variety of online resources are also available to
	assist students and provide additional support for learning. Teachers are
	contacting students directly to meet their individual learning needs.
</p>
<p>
	For meetings, the division will be utilizing electronic signatures for
	IEP/504 documents. When appropriate, parents will be contacted and provided
instructions for the online signature process.	<em>In addition,<strong> </strong></em>computer-based testing will be
	administered, as needed. If necessary for eligibility determination,
	evaluations requiring face-to-face testing administration may be delayed
	with parental permission.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>
	Special education teachers are providing work and communicating in the same
	manner as general education teachers to meet the needs of students. Special
	education teachers are working with general education teachers to provide
	strategies and accommodations to meet Student Learning Plans. IEP Progress
	Reports will be mailed with report cards.
</p>
<p>
	504 case managers and general education teachers are providing specific
	accommodations for students with a 504 plan to meet the Student Leaning
	Plan.
</p>
<p>
	If you have additional questions, please use the following link to contact
	a Special Education Administrator: <a href="/sped/contact.html">www.nnschools.org/sped/contact.html</a></p>
<p>
	<strong>Instructional Support for </strong>
	<strong>English Learners</strong>
</p>
<p>
	English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers are providing work and
	communicating in the same manner as general education teachers to meet the
	needs of students. ESL teachers are working with their collaborative
	general education teachers to provide ESL strategies and accommodations
	based upon each student's English Learner Support Plan (ELSP) as
	appropriate.
</p>
<p>
	In order to support communication with families, teachers and staff will
	utilize the <em>Voiance</em> interpreting services. At the district level,
	all communications are transmitted in English and Spanish.
</p>
<p>
	Newcomer students are also receiving instructional packets mailed to their
	homes in order to provide a hybrid of online and paper practice for
	students. Newcomer and Transition English students have access to Imagine
	Learning. The ESL department is working with teachers on supporting
	literacy instruction and providing needed small group mini lessons for
	literacy gaps.
</p>
<p>
	EL Language Progress Reports will be mailed with report cards.

                use the accounts. All high school students who already had Gmail accounts
                may communicate directly with their teachers via email. To continue with
                online learning for all students, a limited number of Chromebooks are
                available for students. Middle and high school students who do not have a
                computer in the home or internet access, should contact their teacher or
                principal immediately. </p>
              <p> Teachers are planning lessons and using various instructional tools, videos
                and resources to provide engaging lessons for students. Additionally,
                teachers are communicating with students and families to provide support
                and feedback on their learning. Grades will be recorded in StudentVue and
                ParentVue regularly. Students who do not master learning will be provided
                opportunities to improve assignments by completing a similar task or
                assessment. It is the expectation that all students will complete the
                lessons and assignments to continue their learning and to receive credit
                for courses for the 2019-2020 academic school year.  <a href="https://sites.google.com/nn.k12.va.us/nnpscoronavirusacademics/home"> View additional at-home learning resources</a>.</p>

            <p class="mb-1_5"><strong><a href="#faq15" data-cfw="collapse">How will my child's grade be determined? (Secondary Students Grades 6-12)</a></strong></p>
            <div id="faq15" class="mb-1 collapse">
              <p>Based on  federal and state guidance, instruction at the middle and high school levels  will be continued. Clear guidance from the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE)  dictates that students must show mastery of learning for the full year in each  content area. Therefore, NNPS has developed a plan for continuous instruction  to ensure that all students are engaged in continuous learning for the  remainder of the school year. The following section outlines grading  practices for third (MP3) and fourth (MP4) marking period grades.</p>
              <p><strong>MP3  Grading Practices</strong></p>
              <p> Third  quarter (MP3) grades concluded as scheduled on April 3, 2020. For MP3, grades  will be calculated based on a student's grade as of March 13, 2020. Please note,  students can improve their third-quarter grade by completing missing  assignments and assessments that would have normally been allowed had the  quarter continued with schools open. This includes any work that has been  completed since schools have closed. </p>
              <p> MP3  grades were due on April 14, 2020.  MP3  grades will be calculated based on a student's grade as of March 13, 2020.  Any final  grade of F for MP3 will be converted to an I (Incomplete) and submitted as the MP3  grade on April 14, 2020. <u>All (I) Incompletes for MP3 work should be  submitted by May 15, 2020.</u></p>
              <p><em>Note:</em> <em>Teacher  discretion to support individual students will vary with guidance from lead  teachers and school administration.</em></p>
              <p><strong>MP4 Grading Practices</strong></p>
              <p> The new at-home virtual learning plan will begin on April 20,  2020. In order for students to receive credit for the course and move to the  next level, students <u>must</u> show mastery of new learning during the fourth  quarter (MP4). All students who do not show mastery of new learning will  receive a grade of (I) Incomplete; this  includes seniors. Teachers will  make every effort to provide students with opportunities to improve  assignments/grades to resolve the “Incomplete.” However, we do ask students to  follow the suggestions listed in the <em>Expectations  for Student Learning</em> section.</p>
              <p> Students will engage in a variety of  lessons that align with the Virginia Standards of Learning that will require  independent work.  However, some instruction  will be flexible and provide opportunities for students to work collaboratively  with their teachers and peers. Teachers  will provide on-going written and verbal feedback to students and provide  opportunities to improve work before a final grade is recorded.  Teachers will communicate through Google  Classroom, Google Docs, emails, Zoom conferences, Student/Parent Vue and/or  phone calls. </p>
              <p>In an effort to keep parents and  students informed of work being completed and received, or not received,  teachers will use the following codes as placeholders until the assignment has  been graded, and/or feedback has been provided to students to improve a grade.</p>
              <ul>
<li>
<strong>TI</strong> - Turned In - Student has submitted the assignment and the  teacher is in the process of grading the assignment. Teachers will convert to a  numerical grade once the assignment has been graded, and/or the teacher has  provided feedback to the student to improve the grade, if needed. </li>
                <li>
<strong>NT</strong> - Not Turned In - Student has not submitted the assignment. </li>
              </ul>
<p>If a student does not receive a minimum passing grade of 60 on the  first submission of an assignment, students will have up to 5 days to improve  assignments.  <em>Note: Teacher discretion  to support individual students will vary with guidance from lead teachers and  school administration.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Final Grades </strong></p>
              <p>At the conclusion of the school year, grades will be calculated two  ways: </p>
              <ul>
<li>Grades  will calculate using students’ cumulative grades up to March 13, 2020. For  year-long courses, grades will be calculated (1/3+1/3+1/3).</li>
                <li>Students’  grades will also be calculated for grades during the fourth quarter (MP4),  April 20-June 12.  If a student’s average  improves with the inclusion of the MP4 grades, then the MP4 grade will be  “included” in the calculation for the final grade.</li>
              </ul>
<p><strong>Important  Note:</strong> While students may be able to use #1 above as their final grade, students are  still required to complete work during the MP4 (4th quarter) to demonstrate  mastery of new learning.  Any student who does not show mastery (60 or  higher) of new learning during MP4, will receive a grade of (I) Incomplete and  final grades will not be calculated, nor will the student be able to move to  the next level course until the (I) Incomplete has been removed.<strong> </strong></p>
            <em>Report cards will be mailed  to the students’ address in Synergy (the student information system).</em> </div>

              <p> Seniors who have not completed the necessary work to be successful as of
                March 13 will be contacted by their teachers and/or school counselor to
                ensure they are aware of the possibility of not graduating on time. Any
                seniors who were not on track for graduation on March 13 due to grades will
                have the opportunity to improve their grades during the fourth quarter.
                Seniors at risk of not graduating as of March 13 will be contacted by their
                school counselors to develop a specific plan towards graduation. <strong> For determination of the final grade for the course, all seniors will
                have the option of accepting their final average on March 13, 2020 or
                the inclusion of their fourth quarter assignments. </strong> This will allow all seniors the opportunity of improving their final grade.
                All seniors are expected to complete work being assigned by their teachers
                through the remainder of the school year. </p>

              <p> The State Superintendent has given assurances that seniors who have either
                completed or are currently enrolled in all needed classes and who were on
                track to graduate as of March 13, 2020, will graduate. It is imperative
                that those seniors who are determined to be in jeopardy of not graduating
                make every effort to work with their teachers and school counselors for the
                remainder of the year to ensure their grades are on track for graduation.
                Doing so will allow NNPS to grant our seniors the credits needed to
                graduate. We encourage parents or seniors to email their school counselor
                regarding their eligibility for graduation or other related questions. </p>
              <p> The U.S. Department of Education has waived accreditation requirements this
                year. Consequently, the Virginia Department of Education has approved the
                cancellation of the administration of the Standards of Learning Assessments
                (SOLs) for the 2019-2020 school year. While specific graduation
                requirements such as verified credits (of courses students are currently
                enrolled in), CTE Credentials, online learning, CPR, W!SE Financial
                Literacy and the like is still being determined, school divisions have been
                given the ability to waive these requirements, and those that are required
                by law are likely to be addressed by the General Assembly soon. </p>
              <p> Again, we want all our seniors to know that we are going to do everything
                we can do to make sure that they will still receive their diploma. Our high
                school staff will be working with each student and family to make sure they

            <div id="faq30" class="mb-1 collapse">
              <p> We have heard from many of our seniors and their families. High school
                graduation is an important milestone and we will do all that we can to
                ensure that the Class of 2020 is able to participate in this significant
                occasion. Currently, our high school commencement ceremonies are scheduled
                for June 4-7, 2020. We have secured the alternate dates of July 9-12, 2020,
                with the Ferguson Center for the Arts and the Hampton Coliseum should the
                June dates be deemed unsafe for a community gathering. We have also
                explored the option of hosting commencement exercises virtually. As always,
                we will solicit input from our students, schools and community as we
                finalize any plans. </p>

            <p class="mb-1_5"><strong><a href="#faq32" data-cfw="collapse">Can we go to school to pick up what we need?</a></strong></p>
            <div id="faq32" class="mb-1 collapse">
              <p> Beginning April 15, all schools will have office hours every Wednesday from
                8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Parents will be able to pick up medications and other
                essential items, and register and withdraw their children by appointment
                only. Parents may request an appointment by visiting the "contact us" link
                at the top of the school's webpage or by calling the school and leaving a
                message. A school administrator or office professional will contact the
                parent to set up an appointment time. Parents are asked to bring a photo ID
                to their scheduled appointment and should avoid coming to the school if
                they are ill. </p>

            <div id="faq34" class="mb-1 collapse">

                refunds. Click on the "contact us" link at the top of the school's webpage
                or call the school and leave a message. Please be sure to include your

                or event. A school staff member will contact you and provide you with

            <div id="faq36" class="mb-1 collapse">
              <p>The school division would like to continue to provide these valuable internship experiences for our high school students but is unable to make that determination at this time given building access restrictions and social distancing requirements. If the internship program and STEP are reinstituted for this summer, the information will be posted on the NNPS webpage in upcoming months. </p>
