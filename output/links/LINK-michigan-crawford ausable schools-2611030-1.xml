To provide you with the latest information and updates as to how the COVID-19 virus is affecting our school district, we have created this webpage.

<p class="content_intro">The following information will provide a summary overview of our distance learning plans and efforts moving forward.</p>

<h3>● Stage 1 - <strong>Technology and Learning Resource Assessments </strong><br>
                   <em>Immediately and Continuing </em><br>
 </h3>

<p><strong>○ Device/Internet Access:</strong> We have already completed an initial survey of families and staff regarding device availability and home internet capabilities. This information, along with other data, has helped to inform our decisions and planning.<br><br><strong>○ Device Checkouts: </strong>We have already distributed several hundred Chromebooks. We want to thank our families for their cooperation during the checkouts to follow social distancing measures. As mentioned previously, we are waiving initial fees for the remainder of the year provided the devices are returned in working order. If you have internet access at home, these devices will be key tools for learning engagement. If you do not have the internet at home, these devices may still provide opportunities for learning engagement by accessing public <span>wifi</span>, combined with “offline” work options within the Google platform. These devices will be collected in June at the conclusion of the school year.<br><br><strong>○ Device Security and Monitoring:</strong> Parents who elect to check out a device are reminded to monitor student use. Inappropriate use of district technology will result in the individual account/device being disabled.<br><br><strong>○ <span>Repurpose</span> Technology: </strong>We are planning to move some of our <span>wifi</span> routers off our buses to position them in key locations around our district area. These will likely be placed at or near locations already serving as meal pick up points. While <span>Chromebook</span> devices require an internet connection, data can be “synced” to these devices for “offline” work options. Please note that any public wifi location may be used for this purpose.<br><br><strong>○ Engaging Students and Families: </strong>Beginning the week of April 6, building teachers will be contacting individual students/families who have not yet had direct contact with teachers. The purpose of these calls is to establish communication and provide a more detailed picture of learning resources/technology at home. Please note that you may receive phone calls from unfamiliar numbers. While many staff will be calling from <span>CASD</span> phones, because of our need to support remote operations, some may be using alternative numbers. We all know that unwanted calls can be a nuisance, and we will make every effort to limit non-essential calls to families following these initial contacts.</p>

<h3>● Stage 2 - Continuity of Learning Plans</h3>

<h3>                   <em>March 16 and Continuing </em>
</h3>

<p>○ <strong>Building Level Planning:</strong> Each building has been working by department and/or grade to address the unique needs of each level and each building. This work will continue in the weeks ahead. This information will help inform the overall plan required for review and approval by the <span>ISD</span> and Board of Education. Once finalized and approved, the plan will be published on our website. We anticipate the plan will be published the week of April 13.</p>

<h3><strong>● Stage 3 - Engagement and Monitoring<br><em>                   Week of April 13 and Continuing</em></strong></h3>

<p><strong>○ Supportive Learning Opportunities: </strong>All staff will initiate these efforts the week of April 13. Some staff have already generated online options as well as hardcopy packets of learning materials that may have arrived in the mail previously. These options will continue to scale up during the week of April 13. All families across all grade levels will have access to these options.<br><br><strong>○ Alternatives to Online:</strong> As a part of the initial calls, staff will be determining the need for paper packets for families without technology resources. These packets will be delivered either through the mail or through coordinated pickups at meal sites. Staff will be available to consult and work with these students via phone or other appropriate means to support learning with these materials.<br><br><strong>○ Google Classroom and Related Technologies: </strong>All staff will be utilizing Google Classroom and Google Suite applications as a part of our learning engagement. Staff may also be utilizing additional applications including Zoom video conferencing, <span>Edmodo</span>, and others.<br><br><strong>○ Office Hours: </strong>All teaching staff and related personnel will be keeping weekly office hours. These times will be published on our webpage during the week of April 13. During these times, the staff member will be active within their district Google account, responding to emails, providing direct and/or group support to students/families, scheduling individual meetings with students/families, or other related tasks. Staff members are also available outside these times for additional support based on parent/student requests.</p>

<h3>Returning Students' Assignments to Buildings</h3>

<p>Procedures for returning completed hardcopy activities to your teacher are outlined below. Please remember that most staff will work to find an alternative to returning materials/activities.  </p>

<h4>
<em><strong>Only activities requested to be returned should be returned. </strong></em> <br>
 </h4>

<h4>
<em>Please make sure your student’s name is on each document returned and the building name is clearly visible on the envelope.</em><br>
 </h4>

<p><strong>Take a Picture/Email:</strong> If a student or family is able, take a picture of the document using a cellphone and forward that image to the teacher via his/her email address. </p>

<p><strong>Drop Off at Any Meal Pickup Locations:</strong> <em><strong>Using the original envelope,</strong></em> place any items/activities needing to be returned and drop them off at any of the meal pickup locations on the schedule noted below.</p>

<p>Meals are available for pickup at the following locations from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grayling Elementary - Entrance near Devereaux Library</li>
	<li>Grayling Middle School - Entrance off Ottawa Street</li>
	<li>Beaver Creek Township Hall</li>
	<li>Frederic Township Hall</li>
	<li>Maple Forest Township Hall</li>
	<li>Lovells Township Hall</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drop Off at GHS:</strong> <strong><em>Using the original envelope, </em></strong>you can drop these off in the entryway at the high school. There will be a box designated for each building. Please place the envelope in the correct box.  </p>

<p>All materials will be routed to the respective buildings/teachers, as appropriate. Please remember that there will be delays in interschool mail during our closure, and staff is aware to make efforts to work with students/families to use alternative means to communicate.  </p>

<p>If you are unable to return items per the above process, please contact your teacher during office hours to discuss options, or you may contact your building principal.  </p>

<h2>CASD FAQs - Coronavirus Closure</h2>

<p><strong>● Is this (GVDL) work required for students and will they be given “credit”?<br>
A: </strong>Yes and yes. Schools must make a good-faith effort to continue to provide the highest level of educational opportunities possible under difficult circumstances. For this to have value, the same is required of our students and families. Students and families should approach this as a requirement. If families feel they have barriers to engaging in learning activities, please contact your teacher or building principals for assistance. We are prepared to work closely with our families to support learning.</p>

<p><strong>● Is my student expected to complete all the work they would normally do in a regular trimester?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>No. Staff recognize the need to scale work down significantly and/or develop alternative ways to demonstrate learning. These efforts will also be in support of essential learning already completed.<br><br><strong>● What about grades on report cards/transcripts for Trimester 3?<br>
A: </strong>Teachers will continue to utilize Skyward to communicate learning with grades, where appropriate, but transcripts will reflect credit or no credit for Trimester 3 at the secondary level. Elementary students’ progress toward meeting essential learning will be communicated to families by the teacher. We are continuing to examine potential implications for transcripts and will update information here as necessary.<br><br><strong>● Will my student advance a grade level next year?<br>
A: </strong>Students who were on track to move up a grade level will have the opportunity to do so. Again, it is important that students/families make a good faith effort to engage in these learning opportunities. The decision to not advance a grade level and the process to consider this option is different in each of our buildings. Our efforts will be focused on advancing all students forward. We also recognize that our classes may look different next fall and opportunities for additional support or remediation may need to be built in or added to our schedule to support students.<br><br><strong>● Will my senior graduate?<br>
A: </strong>High school seniors who were on track will have the opportunity to graduate. Per the executive order, the district “shall implement a process to issue grades to pupils in grade 12, award credits needed for graduation, provide for completion of the Michigan Merit Curriculum, issue diplomas to pupils in grade 12, and reflect continued learning by pupils in grade 12 pursuant to this order.” Again, it is important that seniors continue to make a good faith effort moving forward. For those students who were behind in credits, the high school staff will be working with those students to determine a path to graduation.<br><br><strong>● What about the graduation ceremony and other senior events?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>Conversations have already started with our seniors and with parents about the events that will have to change during the term of the executive order. Mrs. Sarah Allen, GHS Principal, will be working with this group to find new ways to celebrate our students. More information will follow on this.<br><br><strong>● What about other events like prom, concerts, and sports?<br>
A: </strong>These events are postponed indefinitely. The Michigan High School Athletic Association has canceled the remainder of the 2019-20 winter and spring sports seasons, in compliance with the April 2 "state of disaster" directive by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer closing school buildings and moving education online for the remainder of the school year to help decrease the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.<br><br>
● <strong>I have my Chromebook but need my charging cord from my locker. What do I do?<br>
A: </strong>Contact the building office to arrange to pick up.<br><br><strong>● What about state testing?<br>
A: </strong>All testing previously scheduled, including the M-STEP and the SAT, will be canceled. We anticipate a fall date for current juniors to take the SAT.<br><br><strong>● What about AP tests?<br>
A: </strong>The College Board has already published information for students enrolled in AP testing, and our AP staff has already been working to provide guidance to these students. If any student has not yet been contacted, please call Mrs. Allen at 344-3532.<br><br><strong>● What about the items in my locker?<br>
A: </strong>Locker clean-out will be done at another time. It is more likely that lockers will be cleaned out by staff and items returned through a curbside pickup. It will be several weeks before this process is started.<br><br><strong>● I deposited money for a class trip. What will happen to these funds?<br>
A: </strong>Deposits will be returned in the weeks ahead. Please remember that we are still operating with limited staff in our buildings.<br><br><strong>● When/How will I return my Chromebook or other school property?<br>
A: </strong>School property, including Chromebooks/other devices, will be collected at the end of the school year in June.<br><br><strong>● I am a parent and I need help with the Chromebook or other software. Can someone help me?<br>
A: </strong>Yes, we are working on providing contact information for families for assistance and training.</p>

<p>April 17, 2020<br><br>
Hello CASD Staff, Families, and Community:<br><br>
We are concluding the first week of our Grayling Viking Distance Learning program. I have heard of many successes and positive stories about these first days. I want to extend my thanks to our students, families, and staff for the collective effort and patience shown by everyone. There have been some frustrations as well, and there will continue to be challenges as we move forward. I am confident that as a school family we can overcome these obstacles.<br><br>
These first weeks of our distance learning program are extremely important. As shared from the beginning, the success of our program will rest on the good faith efforts we all make during this difficult time -- our schools, our staff, our students, and our families. Course and grade-level content has been modified to the most essential work, and our staff is committed to working closely with our students and families to support learning.<br><br>
It is important that students engage with their teacher(s) from the beginning. We have shared previously that students who were on track to move up a grade level will have the opportunity to do so. Likewise, seniors who were on track will have the opportunity to graduate. Our efforts remain focused on advancing all students, but it is critical for students to remain engaged in learning as we move forward.<br><br>
For elementary students, progress toward meeting essential learning will be communicated to families by the teacher. For our secondary students, transcripts will reflect credit or no credit for Trimester 3. It is important to note that “credit” on a transcript will not impact the GPA but will help document the completion of the course/credit. However, a “no credit” score will have a negative impact on GPA and may require additional work (summer school, etc.) prior to credit being awarded. This is particularly important for high school students. Again, it remains our goal to engage and advance all students appropriately.<br><br>
We are continuing to work through the setup for our Skylert messenger system. In addition to our email communications, this new system will integrate with our Skyward student information system (SIS) and allow us to send text messages and recorded announcements to our staff and families when necessary. To receive text messages, staff and families will need to “opt-in” to this feature. Staff and parents can text <strong>“Y”</strong> or <strong>“Yes”</strong> to 67587. This will register the mobile number with our system. Please note that this option is only available to staff and families registered in our Skyward SIS. This is an optional feature, and you can stop this service by replying “Stop” to any one of our messages later. We plan to have it online and operational in the next few weeks.<br><br><a href="/downloads/administration/sms_text_opt-in_flyer_67587.pdf" target="_blank">View the opt-in flyer for more information.</a><br><br>
Please continue to check our COVID-19 resources and updates section on our website. Additional and/or updated information will be posted there to keep our staff and families informed. Included in this update is information on how to return completed hardcopy activities. Please remember that only those activities requested to be returned by the teacher need to be turned in using this process. Please check with your teacher before returning any items.<br><br>
Spring in Northern Michigan always carries with it a sense of hope and renewal. These are difficult times, but our staff is here to assist. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.<br><br><em>We will get through this together!</em><br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Justin Gluesing</p>

<p>I am including the information that was previously sent to families through email. Some of the information has been updated and some new information has been added. Specifically, you will find information on Device Repair as well as Tech Support for software issues or assistance. Please review this information carefully and consider reviewing it with your student. </p>

<p>I want to remind families that key updates and related forms and information (Device Checkout, Device Repair, FAQ’s, etc.) can be found on our website by following the link to the COVID-19 Resources and Updates page. This area will be updated continually as we move forward. This letter will be posted on our website but is being sent through traditional mail to ensure all families receive it. If you are unable to access this information online or if you have a general question, please call 344-3754. </p>

<p>Again, please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My sincere thanks to you and to our staff and community. </p>

<p>We will get through this together! </p>

<h2>Grayling Viking Distance Learning (GVDL) </h2>

<p>The following information will provide a summary overview of our distance learning plans and efforts moving forward. </p>

<h3>● Stage 1 - Technology and Learning Resource Assessments<br>
    <em>Immediately and Continuing </em><br>
 </h3>

<p>○ Device/Internet Access: We have already completed an initial survey of families and staff regarding device availability and home internet capabilities. This information, along with other data, has helped to inform our decisions and planning. </p>

<p>○ Device Checkouts: We have already distributed several hundred Chromebooks. We want to thank our families for their cooperation during the checkouts to follow social distancing measures. As mentioned previously, we are waiving initial fees for the remainder of the year provided the devices are returned in working order. If you have internet access at home, these devices will be key tools for learning engagement. If you do not have the internet at home, these devices may still provide opportunities for learning engagement by accessing public wifi, combined with “offline” work options within the Google platform. These devices will be collected in June at the conclusion of the school year. </p>

<p>○ Device Security and Monitoring: Parents who elect to check out a device are reminded to monitor student use. Inappropriate use of district technology will result in the individual account/device being disabled. </p>

<p>○ Repurpose Technology: We are planning to move some of our wifi routers off our buses to position them in key locations around our district area. These will likely be placed at or near locations already serving as meal pick up points. While Chromebook devices require an internet connection, data can be “synced” to these devices for “offline” work options. Please note that any public wifi location may be used for this purpose. </p>

<p>○ Engaging Students and Families: Beginning the week of April 6, building teachers will be contacting individual students/families who have not yet had direct contact with teachers. The purpose of these calls is to establish communication and provide a more detailed picture of learning resources/technology at home. Please note that you may receive phone calls from unfamiliar numbers. While many staff will be calling from CASD phones, because of our need to support remote operations, some may be using alternative numbers. We all know that unwanted calls can be a nuisance, and we will make every effort to limit non-essential calls to families following these initial contacts. </p>

<h3>● Stage 2 - Continuity of Learning Plans<br>
    <em>March 16 and Continuing </em><br>
 </h3>

<p>○ Building Level Planning: Each building has been working by department and/or grade to address the unique needs of each level and each building. This work will continue in the week ahead. This information will help inform the overall plan required for review and approval by the ISD and Board of Education. Once finalized and approved, the plan will be published on our website. We anticipate the Plan will be published early the week of April 13. </p>

<h3>● Stage 3 - Engagement and Monitoring<br>
    <em>Week of April 13 and Continuing</em> </h3>

<p>○ Supportive Learning Opportunities: All staff will initiate these efforts the week of April 13. Some staff have already generated online options as well as hardcopy packets of learning materials that may have arrived in the mail previously. These options will continue to scale up during the week of April 13. All families across all grade levels will have access to these options. </p>

<p>○ Alternatives to Online: As a part of the initial calls, staff will be determining the need for paper packets for families without technology resources. These packets will be delivered either through the mail or through coordinated pickups at meal sites. Staff will be available to consult and work with these students via phone or other appropriate means to support learning with these materials. </p>

<p>○ Google Classroom and Related Technologies: All staff will be utilizing Google Classroom and Google Suite applications as a part of our learning engagement. Staff may also be utilizing additional applications including Zoom video conferencing, Edmodo, and others. </p>

<p>○ Office Hours: All teaching staff and related personnel will be keeping weekly Office Hours. These times will be published on our webpage during the week of April 13. During these times, the staff member will be active within their district Google account, responding to emails, providing direct and/or group support to students/families, scheduling individual meetings with students/families, or other related tasks. Staff members are also available outside these times for additional support based on parent/student requests.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions </h2>

<p><strong>● Is this work required for students and will they be given “credit”?<br>
A: </strong>Yes and yes. Schools must make a good-faith effort to continue to provide the highest level of educational opportunities possible under difficult circumstances. For this to have value, the same is required of our students and families. Students and families should approach this as a requirement. If families feel they have barriers to engaging in learning activities, please contact your teacher or building principals for assistance. We are prepared to work closely with our families to support learning. </p>

<p><strong>● Is my student expected to complete all the work they would normally do in a regular trimester?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>No. Staff recognize the need to scale work down significantly and/or develop alternative ways to demonstrate learning. These efforts will also be in support of essential learning already completed. </p>

<p><strong>● Will my student get a “grade” for the work they do?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>We recognize that “grades” are another issue for some students in our upper grade levels. Clarification on the issue of grades will follow. Whatever the final solution, students will be held harmless. </p>

<p><strong>● Will my student advance a grade level next year?<br>
A: </strong>Students who were on track to move up a grade level will have the opportunity to do so. Again, it is important that students/families make a good faith effort to engage in these learning opportunities. The decision to not advance a grade level and the process to consider this option is different between each of our buildings. Our efforts will be focused on advancing all students forward. We also recognize that our classes may look different next fall and opportunities for additional support or remediation may need to be built in or added to our schedule to support students. </p>

<p><strong>● Will my senior graduate?<br>
A: </strong>High school seniors who were on track will have the opportunity to graduate. Per the executive order, the district “shall implement a process to issue grades to pupils in grade 12, award credits needed for graduation, provide for completion of the Michigan Merit Curriculum, issue diplomas to pupils in grade 12, and reflect continued learning by pupils in grade 12 pursuant to this order.” Again, it is important that seniors continue to make a good faith effort moving forward. For those students who were behind in credits, the high school staff will be working with those students to determine a path to graduation. </p>

<p><strong>● What about the graduation ceremony and other senior events?<br>
A:</strong> Conversations have already started with our seniors and with parents about the events that will have to change during the term of the executive order. Mrs. Sarah Allen, GHS Principal, will be working with this group to find new ways to celebrate our students. More information will follow on this. </p>

<p><strong>● What about other events like prom, concerts, and sports?<br>
A: </strong>These events are postponed indefinitely. The Michigan High School Athletic Association has canceled the remainder of the 2019-20 Winter and Spring sports seasons, in compliance with the April 2 “state of disaster” directive by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer closing school buildings and moving education online for the remainder of the school year to help decrease the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. </p>

<p><strong>● I have my Chromebook but need my charging cord from my locker. What do I do?<br>
A: </strong>Contact the building office to arrange to pick up. </p>

<p><strong>● What about state testing?<br>
A: </strong>All testing previously scheduled, including the M-STEP and the SAT, will be canceled. We anticipate a fall date for current juniors to take the SAT. </p>

<p><strong>● What about AP tests?<br>
A: </strong>The College Board has already published information for students enrolled in AP testing and our AP staff has already been working to provide guidance to these students. If any student has yet to have contact, please contact Mrs. Allen at 344-3532. </p>

<p><strong>● What about the items in my locker?<br>
A: </strong>Locker clean-out will be done at another time. It is more likely that lockers will be cleaned out by staff and items returned through a curbside pickup. It will be several weeks before this process is started. </p>

<p><strong>● I deposited money for a class trip.<br>
A: </strong>What will happen to these funds? Deposits will be returned in the weeks ahead. Please remember that we are still operating with limited staff in our buildings. </p>

<p><strong>● When/How will I return my Chromebook or other school property?<br>
A: </strong>School property, including Chromebooks/other devices, will be collected at the end of the school year in June. </p>

<p><strong>● I am a parent and I need help with the Chromebook or other software. Can someone help me?<br>
A: </strong>Yes, we are working on providing contact information for families for assistance and training. </p>

<p>April 3, 2020</p>

<p>Hello CASD Staff, Families, and Community:<br><br><em>We will get through this together! </em>I have concluded each of my updates with this but felt it important to begin there today.<br><br>
While the building closures were anticipated, the governor’s executive order on Thursday stirred up many emotions. In recent conversations with staff, many have been moved to tears over the closure. We feel for our kindergarteners just beginning school, and for our senior class nearing graduation, and for all “our kids” across the grade levels and buildings. Though our buildings are closed, learning will not stop and our staff is working to engage with our students and families.<br><br>
Under the Executive Order, schools “must continue to provide, and students must continue to receive, the highest level of educational opportunities possible under the difficult circumstances now before us.” Since we first closed and through our spring break, staff have been meeting continuously, and we have been planning to deliver supportive learning opportunities for students moving forward. In the coming week, buildings will be finalizing plans to rollout information to families regarding these opportunities. How we interact will change for the time being. We will all have to learn how to do some new things and how to do some old things in new ways.<br><br>
COOR ISD must approve our local district plans, and we will be working with our ISD partners to finalize these details. These plans must be in place not later than April 28, but we know learning activities will scale up more quickly for our district. All families should expect learning engagement to be started not later than the week of April 13. Again, there are many details yet to be worked out, and we are prepared to adjust where necessary to meet the needs of our students and families.<br><br>
We know that there will be setbacks as we continue to respond to our new normal, but we will continue to do everything in our power to support our students, families, staff, and community. Please review the information on the following pages. More information will follow in the week ahead.<br><br>
Sincerely, Justin Gluesing<br><br><br><br>

<p>March 27, 2020<br><br>
Hello CASD Staff, Families, and Community:<br><br>
This afternoon I was able to participate in a call with Dr. Michael Rice, State Superintendent, and several hundred district superintendents from across Michigan. Dr. Rice did not share any new information but did stress that he expects better clarification in the week ahead on the most pressing issues for schools and school families. As I have shared, districts are needing clarification on several items before making decisions about the next steps. State lawmakers are scheduled to return to session on Wednesday. Between now and then, I expect leadership from the governor’s office, the Michigan Department of Education, and the legislature to be meeting to craft out more definitive guidance for schools.<br><br>
The call took place after comments from Governor Whitmer were reported in the media regarding a return to school being “very unlikely” given what is happening globally and within our own state relative to COVID-19. Dr. Rice clarified that while he understands her comments, this is yet to be determined or ordered by the governor. Again, it is likely that we will learn more in the week ahead.</p>

<p>During the closure, our meal program has been tremendous. Today, over 3,800 meals were picked up/delivered to more than 600 children! This is our highest total yet. In response to this growth, beginning Wednesday, April 1, Grayling Middle School and Grayling High School will be added as temporary meal pickup locations. In addition, we will be offering an <em>optional</em> device checkout for CASD students during meal pickup times at school buildings.<br><br>
Again, this is <strong>optional</strong>, and students/families are not required to check out a device. Please remember that most devices (e.g. Chromebooks) will only work with an internet connection.<br><br>
Parents/Guardians wishing to check out their student’s assigned device <strong>must complete </strong>the online form found on the CASD website in advance of meal pickups, or you may follow the appropriate link below.</p>

<p>● <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGSnIUA7NLeV1_Cg7dJWI_JAz2K6VoHzJ1msA-3datk/viewform?ts=5e7e42ac&amp;edit_requested=true" target="_blank">GES Device Checkout</a><br>

Devices will <strong>only </strong>be available by appointment at school buildings during scheduled meal pickup times. For GE or GMS students, devices will only be issued to a parent/guardian. Please note that other belongings will <strong>not </strong>be retrieved from lockers or other areas. Devices will be returned/collected once school resumes, and initial checkout fees will be waived for the remainder of the school year provided the device is returned in operating condition.<br><br>
CASD Food Service will continue to offer FREE breakfast and lunch to ALL children ages 18 and under, as well as students with disabilities ages 18-26 with an active IEP, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Meals provided are for multiple days and are available for pickup at the following locations from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm:</p>

          ○ Grayling Middle School - Entrance off of Ottawa Street <br><br><strong>Families are reminded to follow social distancing during meal pickups. </strong><br><br>
As mentioned, I hope the week ahead provides additional clarity for our schools. I will keep you informed. My thanks again to our entire CASD family.<br><br><em>We will get through this together! </em></p>

<p>March 24, 2020 <br><br>
Hello CASD Staff, Families, and Community: <br><br>
Yesterday, Governor Whitmer signed the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order that became effective at 12:01 a.m. today. The order remains in effect ​until April 13 at 11:59 p.m.​ If schools are able to return to operations, the first day back will be Tuesday, April 14.<br>
  <br>
Since the initial school closure announcement, CASD has been operating with minimal staff in our buildings. With our Spring Break beginning this past Friday, staffing has already reduced naturally. On-campus operations will further narrow to the extent necessary and allowable under this new order and related guidance.  </p>

<p>According to this most recent order, critical workers include those staff described by the Director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency guidance of March 19, 2020, on the COVID-19 response. To review the full guidance, click ​<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA-Guidance-on-Essential-Critical-Infrastructure-Workers-1-20-508c.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>​.  </p>

<p>Consistent with the governor’s order and the guidance noted, workers necessary to conduct minimum basic operations include the following: </p>

<p>● Food Service staff, Bus Drivers, and other support personnel specifically involved in operations related to the preparation and delivery of the special meals program.  </p>

<p>● Staff and volunteers necessary to complete student Pantry Bag (food supply) assembly and distribution. </p>

<p>● Information Technology (I.T.) personnel required to maintain digital systems infrastructure, communications systems, and other technology-related operations. </p>

<p>● Custodial staff necessary to ensure continuity of building functions and physical plant operations, including essential ​facility cleaning and disinfecting​. Custodial staff are directed to deep clean and disinfect all food preparation areas currently in use daily. </p>

<p>● Bargaining unit leaders who perform critical labor union functions, including those who monitor the well-being and safety of members. Duties should be done by telephone or remotely where possible. </p>

<p>● Staff necessary to conduct basic operations including payroll, employee benefits, or other functions as determined by the superintendent as essential for operations. </p>

<p>● Educators supporting or facilitating distance learning or performing other functions determined by the superintendent to be essential for operations. <br><br>
Consistent with prior directives, staff designated as essential are permitted on campus only to the extent necessary to complete duties. Any staff member or other individual authorized to be on campus must adhere to social distancing practices (6 ft. apart) and other mitigation measures (frequent handwashing, cover coughs and sneezes, etc.). </p>

<p>During the remaining term of the school closure, principals and supervisors are directed to limit in-person work, activities, and interactions to the extent possible. Face-to-face meetings should be shifted to virtual options where practicable and/or adhere to social distancing minimums.  In addition, staff are to work from home where able and if necessary to operations. Work from home options must be authorized by the building principal and/or supervisor and the superintendent. <br>
 <br>
Those staff permitted to work under the current order must stay home if sick. Further, if any staff member has been notified as having had contact with a person suspected to have COVID-19 and is advised by community health professionals to self-quarantine, you must follow these guidelines.  </p>

<p>I am sharing this information broadly to our staff, families, and community so that we are all aware of the efforts CASD is making to comply with the executive order while maintaining safe and essential operations.  <br><br>
For our students and families, thank you for your support and patience. We continue to process information day-by-day, and I will keep you updated as we know more. Though we are currently on our regularly scheduled spring break, our CASD leadership team has been in contact daily. While we are all eager to return to normal operations, we recognize that we need to see where the facts take us and that our new normal may look different as we move through the remainder of this school year.  <br>
We are also waiting on clear guidance from our state legislature and state leaders on items specific to school operations. Critical among these decisions are those related to online and other instructional delivery options, as well as makeup days. These decisions are important and needed to inform our next steps.  <br><br>
My thanks again to our entire CASD family. <em>We will get through this together!</em><br>
 <br>
Sincerely, <br>
Justin Gluesing </p>

<p>March 20, 2020<br><br>
Hello CASD Staff, Parents, and Community Members:<br><br>
I want to begin by giving thanks to our staff, parents, students, and community members. These first days have brought with them many questions and concerns, but across our staff and community, the offers to help and positive messages continue to overwhelm the worry and uncertainty.<br><br>
I know you have questions, and we want to keep each of you informed. We have launched a new form through our website that will allow you to submit your questions online. Below, you will find a link to an online form to submit questions. We will periodically review questions and generate an FAQ document for you to reference. We will do our best to respond to each question, but questions of a similar nature may be combined into one answer summary.<br><br>
On Thursday, I participated in a webinar with Governor Whitmer, State Superintendent Dr. Michael Rice, and other lead health and education officials. This update primarily reiterated the information we already knew. Officials underscored that we are still in a monitoring phase, and again noted that our return to school on Monday, April 6 will depend on where the facts take us.<br><br>
During these last four days, staff from each building have met multiple times to advance our planning around instructional delivery alternatives should our closure be extended. Today, the Michigan Department of Education released a memo addressing virtual learning options. The memo reads in part, “There is no mechanism to earn instructional time during a period of mandated school closure.” This statement is referring to the mandated hours and days of instruction required for schools and is only stating the "legislated" facts as they currently exist. All districts are hoping that our legislature works to provide the needed flexibility for districts to maintain student engagement. Not unlike the flexibility provided to get food to our families, our state leaders need to show the same initiative to get teachers re-connected with kids should the closure be extended.<br><br>
We are being patient, but we are not sitting still. Our staff will continue to work during the closure to prepare as needed. The professionalism and “can do” attitudes displayed by our staff have been amazing. My sincere thanks to all of them!</p>

<p>I recognize that this remains a difficult situation for all our families. I know, too, that for our seniors, this can be particularly unsettling. To help answer questions specific to this group, Olivia VanDeVen, a senior and GHS Student Senate Governor, will be communicating regularly with Mrs. Sara Allen, GHS Principal. We will look to provide answers to the questions and concerns we receive.<br><br>
I also want to remind all our families again about our FREE meal program. On Friday, over 3,400 meals were picked up/delivered across our district. Please remember that our meal service will continue next week over the regularly scheduled Spring Break.<br><br>
Lastly, I want to encourage our staff and community to help our local businesses during this time as well. Our community businesses continually support our schools and school programs. Now is our opportunity to support them.<br><br>
Again, my deepest thanks to our community and to our entire CASD family. <em>We will get through this together!</em><br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Justin Gluesing</p>

Hello CASD Staff, Parents, and Community Members:<br><br>
As of today, we are expecting to return to school on Monday, April 6, but as a district, we are making contingency plans should our closure be extended. Over the last two days, administrative and teacher leadership team members have been meeting and discussing plans on how we move forward with instruction should we be unable to return to school on April 6.<br><br>
In the days ahead, we will begin gathering some of the data we need. We will be sending home a survey with report cards, as well as sharing a link via email and social media for families. This will help us gauge how many CASD families currently have internet access at home. We request that the survey be completed only once per family. We are also planning for an optional device checkout during the week of March 30 for students/families interested (Chromebook, etc.). Again, these small steps will help us continue to prepare for an extended closure should it become necessary to move forward with an alternative plan for instruction. In addition, we recognize that online delivery may not be an option for all, and we are working to personalize our instructional delivery to the learning needs of our students.<br><br>
This remains a fluid situation, and how this issue evolves in the days/weeks ahead within our state will inform and guide our next steps.<br><br>
I know that many of our families are wondering about upcoming events (Prom, etc.) that are scheduled for April and May. Moving forward, as I know more, you will know more. When decisions are made on these major events, you will be informed immediately.<br><br>
We have a great staff, and we love the communities and people who make up the Crawford AuSable School District. You have supported and stood by our distrcit, and we will meet any challenge necessary to continue to provide a quality education and educational experience for our students.<br><br>
As a reminder, the CASD Food Service Department is continuing to offer FREE breakfast and lunch to ALL children ages 18 and under, as well as students with disabilities ages 18-26 with an active IEP (individualized education program) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Meals are available for pickup at the following locations from 10:00 am – 1:00 pm:<br>
○ Grayling Elementary Building - Main Entrance near Devereaux Library<br>
○ Beaver Creek Township Hall<br>
○ Frederic Township Hall<br>
○ Maple Forest Township Hall<br>
○ Lovells Township Hall<br><br>
If any families have difficulty making it to the pickup locations or if you have any questions, please call 344-3757.<br><br>
Again, my deepest thanks to our staff, students, parents, and community. <em>We will get through this together!</em><br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Justin Gluesing</p>

March 13, 2020<br><br>
Hello CASD Staff, Parents, and Community Members:<br><br>
Late last night, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and State Superintendent Dr. Michael Rice announced that all K-12 school buildings—public, private and boarding—are ordered to be <strong>closed from Monday, March 16 to Sunday, April 5, 2020. </strong><br><br>
Consistent with this announcement, CASD schools will be closed until Monday, April 6. During this window, CASD was already scheduled to be closed for spring break from Friday, March 20 through Friday, March 27. Though this will extend our break, we recognize that this will be a significant disruption to the daily lives of our students, families, and our staff.<br><br>
Consistent with Governor Whitmer’s directive, we will enact the following measures related to district operations, events, and other programs effective immediately:<br><br>
● All community meetings or gatherings scheduled to take place within our school facilities are suspended until further notice. This includes the recently announced walking track hours for the Viking Activity Center and any other weekend, before school, or after school community events.<br><br>
● The Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) has directed all member schools to suspend activities in all sports for all seasons. All athletic activities are to be halted include practices, scrimmages and competitions, as well as strength training, conditioning, and any other organized sessions and activities in all MHSAA in-season and out-of-season sports. In addition to athletic programming, all afterschool activities, clubs, or other programs are suspended during the closure. School fundraisers scheduled to be held during the dates of the closure are postponed until further notice. Beginning Monday, April 6, pending any further action by the governor, any after-school activity consisting of a group smaller than 100 individuals (clubs, athletic practices, etc.) may resume.<br><br>
● During the district closure, the Viking Wellness Center inside Grayling High School will be closed. However, the VWC staff will be working to provide medical services for students by appointment only at District Health Department #10, 501 Norway Street, Grayling. If you have questions or if your child is in need of medical services, please call 989-710-5050 to schedule an appointment.<br><br>
● Assemblies and performances in our schools involving participation by the general public are suspended until further notice.<br><br>
● All field trips are suspended until further notice.<br><br>
● During the closure, our custodial staff will be reporting to buildings to deep clean and sanitize all touch surfaces. This includes keyboards, bathrooms, door handles, and any other high-contact surfaces.<br><br>
● For those CASD families participating in Friday Food Pantry Bags, we were able to “double-up” and/or provide additional supplies today before dismissal. We are still working on plans for additional pantry supplies to be available for families currently participating in the program. Additional information will follow in the coming week.<br><br>
● During the next three weeks (March 16 – April 3), the CASD Food Service Department will be offering FREE breakfast and lunch to ALL children age 18 and under on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The package will include two breakfasts and two lunches and will only be available for pickup at the following locations from 10:00 am – 1:00 pm:<br><br>
○ Grayling Elementary Building - Main Entrance near Devereaux Library<br>
○ Beaver Creek Township Hall<br>
○ Frederic Township Hall<br>
○ Maple Forest Township Hall<br>
○ Lovells Township Hall<br><br>
Please contact Kim Schmidt at 344-3757 if you have any questions.<br><br>
● Effective Monday, March 16, only staff essential to district operations are allowed in buildings to the extent necessary. Only payroll, custodial/maintenance, central office staff, building administrators, and other personnel specifically authorized by the administration are permitted in district buildings. School offices should be considered closed for non-essential business. For next week, main office staff in each building will be available on a limited basis for calls.<br><br>
We know that this has impacted our entire district family in varying ways and that this will no doubt create additional anxiety among many. For our students, you can help by taking the following measures:<br><br>
● Offer Comfort and Facts - Correct misinformation and be open to discussing their concerns. Answer questions honestly and calmly. Make sure you are educating yourself by visiting michigan.gov/coronavirus or cdc.gov/Coronavirus/ for the best information.<br><br>
● Help Them Feel in Control - By focusing on what they can do to stay healthy, you help them establish a sense of control. Continue to stress proper handwashing procedures and make sure students continue to get proper rest.</p>

<p>● Keep Students Mentally Active - With the extended break, we encourage families to have their student(s) read every day. If you have internet access, students can utilize online services like Khan Academy, STMath, or other free resources.<br><br>
As Governor Whitmer also shared, the return to school on Monday, April 6 will depend on where the facts take us. This remains a fluid situation, and we will continue to provide updates to our staff, families, and community. Please continue to monitor your email, our district website, and our school Facebook pages for updates or other alerts.<br><br>
My deepest thanks to our staff, students, parents, and community. All the challenges that unfolded today were overshadowed by the patience and the outpouring of help offered by so many. <em>We will get through this together!</em><br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Justin Gluesing<br>
