        <p><span>Dear Marcellus Elementary Family,</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>First let me say I hope you and your family are safe and healthy as you read this letter. Thank you so much for your patience and understanding as we have adjusted as a school community. I am extremely appreciative of our students, parents, teachers and staff for their positivity, flexibility and resilience during this difficult time. </span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>As you know, our continuity of learning plan goes into effect today. Our goal is to provide continuous learning for our students while the school buildings are closed. As we do this, we want to eliminate as much stress as possible for our students, parents, and teachers. While it is our responsibility to continue to educate our children, we also recognize the difficulties this brings to many families. Please know our team at Marcellus Elementary is here to support you as we continue through the remainder of the school year.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Due to the unusual circumstances this year, there will be no 3rd or 4th marking period report card.  Instead, the students will receive a second semester report card at the conclusion of the school year. We have provided you with a report of progress based upon your student’s grades on March 13, 2020, the date of the original closing of the schools. Students who were performing at an undesirable level can improve their grades by completing the work assigned to them during the closure. Although we know some students may be unable to fully participate, teachers and administration expect all students to participate to the extent possible.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Over the next several weeks, district administration will monitor student participation in the distance learning program and will look for ways to improve our plan. Please contact the school office if you need assistance or need to change how your child is receiving their learning assignments.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

        <p><strong>April 19, 2020</strong></p>

<p>  Welcome back to school- distance learning style.  Marcellus Community Schools rolled out the Continuity of Learning (COL) or distance learning plan on Monday.  The plan includes an online learning option for those students who have internet access and a paper option for those without internet access.  Printed packets were made available at Friday’s Grab and Go food distribution and many were mailed to students’ homes.  </p>

<p>     It is important to know that while no student will be penalized if they are unable to<strong> fully </strong>participate, teachers and principals expect all students to participate<strong> to the extent possible.</strong>  Nonetheless, teachers and district officials understand that the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent school closure have created challenges and hardships for students and their families.  Further, it is understood that circumstances for each family may be very different.   It is with a keen awareness of that context that the district created two options (online and printed packets) within the COL plan.  Regardless of the option, successful implementation will require cooperation, flexibility and frequent communication.  While teachers and staff will work hard to communicate with all students and/or parents each week, parents are encouraged to contact school staff for any needed assistance.  Working together will better position our students for the return of face to face instruction. </p>

<p>    Moving forward, the district is working to provide access to the internet in the parking lots of both the middle high school and the old middle school.  This means students/parents may be able to access the internet and/or download materials when in or near those parking lots. Parents will be notified when this project is completed.   While this is not a perfect solution, it is another avenue to access online instructional material.  None of this can replace face-to-face instruction with our teachers, but it may help students be better prepared to return to school when it reopens. </p>

<p>     Over the next several weeks, district officials will monitor student participation in the distance learning program and will look for ways to improve the delivery of services.  Suggestions and feedback are welcome.  Parents may contact me at 269-646-7655 or <a href="mailto:npauley@marcelluscs.org">npauley@marcelluscs.org</a>. </p>

        <h2>From Our Superintendent Mrs. Pauley</h2>

<p>As a result of the school closure and pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order 2020-35, face- to-face instruction is prohibited and Michigan school districts must design and implement a distance learning plan or “continuity of learning plan” for all students.  Marcellus Community Schools will roll out a distance learning plan that includes an online and a printed learning packet option.  Printed packets will be available on April 17 and online instruction will begin on April 20. Parents will receive a letter with details about each learning track this week.</p>

<p>Last week, school staff attempted to contact parents by phone to discuss the learning options and determine which learning track was best suited for their family circumstances.   While district staff was unable to connect with every family, a good portion of parents were reached.  Those parents who did not have contact with the school are asked to email the school principal or call the school and leave a message with updated contact information.   <br>
 </p>

<p>Other important information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grab and Go breakfasts and lunches will continue on Tuesdays and Fridays, from 11:30a.m. until 12:30 p.m.  Parents may also pick up and drop off learning packets during those food distribution times.  While food distribution will conclude at 12:30 p.m., packet pick up will be available until 1:30 p.m.   Additionally, curbside drop boxes will be available for packet drop off on Tuesdays and Fridays, until 7:00 p.m. <span> Please note that the times, dates and procedures for this exchange of student work are subject to change based on safety recommendations and feedback from parents. </span>
</li>
	<li>Seniors who were on track to graduate at the time of the closure will graduate. Any senior who was not on track to graduate will be provided an opportunity to complete coursework that will allow them to graduate.  </li>
	<li>The district’s goal is to have a graduation ceremony when the situation allows.  At this time, district officials are unable to schedule a ceremony or determine what the ceremony might look like.</li>
	<li>All state assessments have been suspended for this year.   This year’s juniors will take the SAT in the fall. </li>
	<li>The Read by Third Grade Law was supposed to be implemented this school year.  As a result of the school closure, the state has suspended the law.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is understood that many students and families will face challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  District staff will do everything possible to ensure students and families are supported throughout the school closure. </span> <span>As our teachers and staff work to implement this new system of learning, we ask for patience and understanding. We will get through this together.  Wildcat Strong!</span></p>

<span class="fa fbcms_ec_titleicon"></span>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <h2>COVID-19 Update, Alt. Learning Plan</h2>

<p><strong>April 5, 2020</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>On April 2, 2020, Governor Whitmer issued executive order No. 2020-35 which temporarily suspends in-person instruction of K-12 students.  The order is meant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The executive order states, “given the virus’s aggressively persistent spread and potentially fatal consequences, in-person instruction in our schools is too dangerous to resume in the near future, and very likely for the remainder of the 2019- 2020 school year.  Nonetheless, as section 1 of article 8 of the Michigan Constitution provides, ‘schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.’  In the face of this pandemic, the education of K-12 students must continue as fully and effectively as possible. While there is no substitute for a highly trained and experienced teacher interacting with students in a classroom, <em>schools must continue to provide, and students must continue to receive, the highest level of educational opportunities possible under the difficult circumstances now before us</em> {emphasis added}.”</p>

<p>As a result of the executive order, schools are charged with designing and implementing an alternative learning plan to ensure students can meaningfully participate in distance or remote learning.   Prior to the roll out, the district must first complete a Continuity of Learning Application and submit it to the Lewis Cass Intermediate School District (LCISD) for approval.  Once approved, the LCISD will submit it to the state. </p>

<p>The tentative plan is for the faculty and administration at Marcellus Community Schools to  deliver distance learning to students through two delivery methods- online or paper learning packets.</p>

<p>For those students who have adequate internet and device access, the instructional delivery mode will be online.  For those students who do not have adequate internet and/or device access, printed learning packets will be provided. The district’s <strong>goal</strong> is to implement this alternative learning plan on April 20. (However, the initial printed learning packet may be available as early as  April 17). In any event, the district will implement the plan by April 28 at the latest.</p>

<p>The district’s <strong>tentative</strong> plan for those who cannot participate in district provided online instruction is as follows.  Printed packets will be provided every Friday, from 11:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m., at the middle high school main entrance and at the Grab and Go meal distribution at the elementary school. Parents or students can also drop off completed work at the same time.  Teacher feedback and communication will be provided on the student’s completed work and will be available for pick up to the parent/ student in the same manner, the following week.  Essentially, those sites will provide avenues to exchange student assignments and completed work.  It is acceptable for parents to arrange for another person (neighbor, family member, friend) to pick up and return student work.  </p>

<p>The exchange process will be done in a drive-through fashion so as to promote social distancing.  Those who walk to the site will be asked to observe posted safety guidelines.   Please note that the times and days for this exchange of student work are subject to change based on safety and feedback from our stakeholders. </p>

<p>For those students who have adequate access to the internet and devices, online instruction will be provided using applications such as Study Island (Edmentum) and Imagine Math. These applications were already being used at some Marcellus buildings and grade levels prior to the school closure.   Once the district’s learning plan has been approved, students and parents will be given instructions about how to access the programs.  As we move forward, it is possible that online applications and tools may evolve in order to improve delivery and instruction. </p>

<p>In the event a student has access to adequate internet, but does not have a device, the parent should contact the school office or principal to arrange possible participation in a Chromebook loan program.  The loan program will require a parent to sign a Chromebook Loan Agreement.</p>

<p>To facilitate this new manner of teaching and learning, it is important that students and parents remain informed. The district will provide information or make announcements on our website, in students’ printed learning packet bags, and on facebook.  In addition, district staff will reach out through phone calls, email and, when needed, through the phone alert system and postal mail.   Parents and students can reach out to district staff through email, phone calls, or notes in the students’ learning packet bag.   The best way to reach teachers and administrators is through email.  However,  parents and students may call the school office, leave a message, and a staff member will return the call.   In addition, teachers will have dedicated remote “office hours” when parents/ students may call the school for assistance. Those hours will be publicized in the coming week(s).  In addition, in order to help with the learning plan, the district will redeploy support staff to work in various areas, including outreach and communication, online support services, copying, mailing, delivery, returning calls, and food distribution.<br><br>
Given the challenges that many families and school staff are facing with this pandemic, we know this new mode of teaching and learning is a big ask. However, I have faith that Marcellus students, families, district teachers, and staff will persevere to provide the best education possible for our children.<br><br>
On another note, school district employees are considered critical employees for the purposes of providing essential services such as delivery of the alternative learning plan and food distribution. Thus, some district staff will have to periodically report to the school buildings. Please understand that the school is committed to implementing and enforcing all the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) safety recommendations, not only for the safety of parents and students, but also for the safety of school faculty and staff who must report to the school.   For that reason, all school buildings will remain closed to the public.  Moreover, to the extent possible, faculty and staff will work from home.  That may mean that some two way communication could take a bit longer.  We ask for grace and patience as we strive to keep all of our school community safe. </p>

<p>To the Class of 2020, I am sorry.  Your senior year will not include some of the traditional rite of passage events like prom, Senior Honors Night and spring sports. Know that the district will celebrate our graduating seniors in the best manner we can, dependent upon the circumstances at the time.   Decisions about what that graduation celebration may look like will be communicated as soon as they are made..  Several possibilities are being discussed, but all are dependent upon the length of the Stay Home, Stay Safe order, as well as any additional executive orders and CDC recommendations that may be issued.</p>

<p>Finally, I know how disappointed, frustrated, and sad most students, parents and others must be. I, along with all school employees and board members, share those same feelings.  We miss our kids, the hugs and high fives, the conversations and interactions, and the joy of seeing their faces each school day!    We will get through this together and look forward to the time when we can meet together again.  </p>

<p>Wildcat Strong!</p>

<p><strong>April 3, 2020</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Good Afternoon Marcellus Families,</p>

<p>As you likely know, the Governor suspended face-to-face instruction for the rest of the school year.  The Governor’s Executive Order also states that, <strong><em>“in the face of this pandemic, the education of K-12 students must continue as fully and effectively as possible.”</em></strong> </p>

<p>Marcellus teachers and administrators are working on an alternative learning plan that considers the needs of all students.  More details will be forthcoming, but please know that two delivery modes are being developed including electronic for those who have adequate internet and device access, as well as printed learning packets. Given the limited internet access in our village, the primary delivery mode will likely be printed packets.</p>

<p>Our goal is to begin the alternative learning plan on April 20.  If you can, please periodically visit our website or facebook page for updates.  Please also be sure to check your mail for updates we may send via the postal service.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and support as we make the significant transition and know that the faculty and staff will do everything we can to support our students and families. </p>

<p>Thank you and stay safe.</p>

<p>Note- a tentative timeline was included in an earlier written communication and is included on the district website.</p>

        <h2>Superintendent's COVID-19 Update</h2>

<p><span>April 2, 2020</span></p>

<p><span>Dear Wildcat Families:</span></p>

<p><span>Earlier today, Governor Whitmer issued Executive Order No. 2020-35 "Provision of K-12 education during the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.”    The order requires that “in person instruction for pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 is suspended for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.”  District leadership is in the process of reviewing the seventeen-page executive order and planning accordingly.   In the interim, please see below for information that may be helpful for parents and students.  </span></p>

<p><span>Please understand that this is a significant transition and the district understands the connectivity challenges that many Marcellus families face.  I am asking for patience and support as our exceptional faculty and staff work to transition from traditional face-to-face instruction to a delivery method that looks very different.   Please see below for a rough timeline. </span></p>

<p><span>1.     March 16 to April 1:  Michigan schools closed and Marcellus, like most school districts, provided alternative learning or engagement opportunities for students via paper packets and other digital resources.  <strong>Please note that these processes are still in place and can be used until new opportunities are developed.</strong></span></p>

<p><span>2.    April 2- the executive order was delivered to all school districts in Michigan.  We have been given a due date, April 28, for the start of new distance learning options.  Local Intermediate School Districts must approve the plans as the representatives of the State. </span></p>

<p><span>3.   April 3- the state plans to deliver a template/format districts will use for the development of our learning plan.  (April 3 is the day spring break officially starts for Cass County schools)</span></p>

<p><span>4.    April 8- Intermediate School Districts will be ready to assist with the development and review of districts’ plans.</span></p>

<p><span>5.    April 13- 17- District staff has been working on distance learning options for our students in the event of an extended closure. Now that we have more information included in the executive order, staff will focus on additional planning and professional development to implement the new distance learning plan.  Our goal is to work with our exceptional staff in order to develop and deliver quality remote /distance learning (both digital and paper-pencil as needed)</span></p>

<p><span>6.    April 17- The target date for the district plan submission and approval.</span></p>

<p><span>7.    April 20- The target date to begin the new process for distance learning.  In the event that goal cannot be met, the plan will start no later than the required April 28 date.</span></p>

<p><span>Rest assured that our learning plan is being developed with two forms of delivery, including electronically for those who have access to adequate internet and devices, and printed learning packets for those who do not.  We are committed to meeting the needs of all students and will do everything we can to prevent our students from being negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span>We will continue to update the school community as the learning plan is developed.  We know there will be many questions and some hiccups as well.  However, know that Marcellus Community Schools is here to support our students and families. </span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Finally, we are committed to celebrating the accomplishments of our seniors.  At this time, we do not know what that celebration might look like or when it will take place.  However, we will solicit input from the Class of 2020 and their parents in the coming weeks.  </span></p>

<p><span>Please stay safe and follow the Center for Disease Control recommendations, including social distancing.  We will get through this together.  </span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely,</span><br>
 </p>

<p><span></span></p>

        <h2>From The Superintendent</h2>

<p>March 29, 2020<br><br>
Dear Wildcat Families:</p>

<p>We are all dealing with an unprecedented pandemic that has significantly altered our way of life.  The school closure and subsequent <em>Stay Home, Stay Safe</em> executive orders are just part of the stressful results of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Right now, I am certain that many parents and students have valid concerns about the virus, health and safety, household finances, school, and even what the future might hold.   I know we are all wondering when this pandemic will end and when we might be able to return to some degree of normalcy.   To say that this is a difficult time for all of us is a gross understatement.</p>

<p>I wish I could provide all the answers, but I cannot.  What I can do is answer as many school-related questions as I can.  Please understand that some questions simply cannot be answered until the state legislature acts and the Michigan Department of Education provides guidance.  Still, I want to provide as much information as possible, knowing that things can change in an instant.  A list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) is listed below. <br>
 On a more personal note, I hope that you are doing well and are finding ways to manage the situation in which we find ourselves.  The faculty and staff miss our kids and are thinking of our families everyday.  Please know that Marcellus Community Schools is here to support our families in whatever way we can.  Don’t hesitate to reach out to me at 269-646-7655 or via email at <a href="mailto:npauley@marcelluscs.org">npauley@marcelluscs.org</a>.  We are Wildcat Strong and we will get through this together.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Superintendent Nanette Pauley<br>
 </p>

<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong><br><br><strong>On March 23, 2020, <span>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued the<em> Stay Home, Stay Safe</em> order for all citizens in the state of Michigan, with only essential or “critical infrastructure” personnel considered exceptions. That order, along with the school closure order, currently runs through April 13, 2020.  </span></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>The current school closure runs through April 13. Could the school closure be extended beyond April 13, 2020?</strong><br>
	Yes.<strong>  </strong><em>While we are preparing to be back in session at the end of the current closure, we understand that the closure could likely be extended.  In addition, the Stay Home, Stay Safe order could also be extended.</em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Will the missed school days be forgiven or will they need to be made up?  </strong><em>The State School Aid Act requires specific day and hour requirements for student attendance.  In the past, the legislature and/or MDE have granted limited waivers to provide some flexibility for schools.  As of today (March 29, 2020), schools have not been given an answer about whether or not the missed days will be forgiven.  For now, we do not know.  </em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Will state testing (PSAT, SAT, MI-Access, WIDA, M-Step) be suspended or waived?</strong><br><em>The US Department of Education waived testing requirements for this school year.  The next step is for the Michigan legislature to amend the law requiring state testing. School districts are waiting for the Michigan Department of Education (MDE)  to notify us, but we fully expect there will be no state testing this school year.</em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>The third marking period was scheduled to end on March 27, 2020.  Will marking period grades/ report cards be issued? </strong><br><em>If school resumes on April 14, the marking period report cards will be issued approximately one week later.  This will allow returning students who may have been absent the week prior to the closure to turn in any missing work/ tests as arranged with their teacher(s).  If the closure is extended, the district is considering other options such as exempting missing assignments from the grade calculation or using a pass, fail  or incomplete mark.  Once we have a better idea of the length of the closure and whether we have to make up days, a more informed decision will be made.  </em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Will seniors graduate on time?</strong><br><em>Please rest assured that we will move every mountain to ensure our seniors who are in good standing graduate on time!  On March 20, Governor Whitmore issued a</em> <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90640-522531--,00.html">press release</a> <em>indicating that she “will be working in the coming days to ensure our seniors graduate and that no child is held back as a result of our ability to provide face-to-face instruction during the COVID-19 school closure.”  </em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong> Are learning resources that the school or teachers posted online required?  Are the paper packets previously provided to students (in the first week of the closure) required?</strong><br><em>No.  The district provided student engagement opportunities as a service to help parents and students during this unprecedented and mandated closure.  We understand that many students and families have limited connectivity and may be dealing with other circumstances that limit engagement throughout the closure.</em> <em> (The district is working on contingency plans to provide instruction in the event the closure is extended, dependent upon future guidance from MDE).  </em>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Will the Grab and Go Meal service continue if the school closure is extended beyond April 13? </strong><br><em>Yes.  Unless guidance to schools changes, it is expected that Grab and Go will continue throughout the closure.  Currently, Grab and Go meal distribution takes place at the middle high school entrance and at the old middle school, on Tuesdays and Fridays, from 11:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. </em> <br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Will Grab and Go Meal Service continue even during the previously scheduled Spring Break (April 3 and April 6-10).  </strong><br><em>Yes.  The district recognizes the financial impact the COVID-19 pandemic and the Stay Home,Stay Safe executive order may have on our students and families.  Thus, we have chosen to continue the meal service, even during the week of spring break. Distribution dates during spring break are April 3, April 7 and April 10.</em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>What is the Mobile Food Pantry?  </strong><br><em>School administration coordinated with the local food pantry for a Mobile Food Pantry to distribute food at the Marcellus Middle High School parking lot on April 1 and April 17, from 11:30 to 12:30 p.m.  The food distribution will be done in a drive through fashion and will be located in the parking lot near the soccer field.  The food distribution is open to all families in need of food assistance.  </em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>What about the year end events such as senior honors night and graduation?</strong><br><em>Currently, no changes to those events have been made.  However, it is possible the events will need to be postponed and/or the events may look different than they have in the past.  Much depends on the length of the school closure and if the Stay Home, Stay Safe Executive Order is extended.  Regardless of the situation, Marcellus Community Schools is dedicated to ensuring our seniors get the recognition and applause they deserve and have earned!  We will update you as we have more information.</em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Kindergarten Round Up is currently scheduled for April 23, from 6:00 p.m to 7:00 p.m.  Will it still take place?</strong><br><em>It is currently still scheduled but will likely be postponed. An online registration may also be an option for some parents.  We will update you as soon as a decision is made.</em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Will Prom, currently scheduled for April 25, still take place?  </strong><br><em>Currently, the prom has not been cancelled or postponed.  However, it is likely that the event will be postponed.  The health and safety of students, chaperones and staff are of paramount importance and will be the main consideration upon which any decisions will be made.  Much is dependent upon whether the school closure and /or the Stay Home Stay Safe mandate is extended.  We will update you as soon as decisions are made.  </em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Are parents able to contact the school during the closure, even during the Stay Home, Stay Safe Executive Order?</strong><br><em>Yes.   During the Stay Home, Stay Home mandate, school offices are closed. During this time, the best way to contact school staff is via email.  Alternatively, parents may call their child’s school office, leave a message and someone will return the call.</em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Are ALL events and activities in the district cancelled or postponed during the closure?</strong><br><em>With the exception of food distribution, yes.  This includes all district events as well as any events held in district buildings/ grounds by outside groups.  </em><br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>What if my student was scheduled to have an IEP meeting during this closure? <em> </em></strong><br>
	You should have been contacted by a principal or special education teacher to discuss options.  If you have not been in communication with the teacher or principal, please reach out to the building principal via email.  Alternatively, you may call the school office and someone will return your call. <br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>What if my student missed a test or an assignment before the school closed?  </strong><br><em>If school resumes on April 14, students will have at least one week to work with their teacher(s) to complete any missing work (assigned prior to the closure).  In some cases, it’s possible that students may be exempted from specific assignments. In ALL cases, the district is committed to working with parents and students to ensure no student is penalized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic closure.  </em><br>

        <h2>From the Superintendent</h2>

<p>On March 23, Governor Whitmer issued an “Stay Home, Stay Safe” executive order No. 2020-21, a temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life.  Her order also extended the school closure through April 13. Barring any additional school closure extensions, Marcellus students should plan to return to school on Tuesday, April 14.  </p>

<p>During this extended closure, school offices will be closed, but Marcellus Community Schools will continue the Grab and Go meal service.   However, there are some significant changes to the process. </p>

<p>Beginning Tuesday, March 24, Grab-n-Go will be offered on Tuesdays and Fridays only. On Tuesdays, participants will receive meals for three days (Tuesday throughThursday). On Friday, participants will receive meals for four days (Friday through Monday).  Grab and Go sites are Marcellus Middle/ High School and the old Marcellus Middle School. Pick up times are 11:30 until 12:30.   </p>

<p>This change means parents or their designee will only need to arrange pick up twice per week. For those who have already arranged for food delivery, know that deliveries will be made on Tuesdays and Fridays. Questions about meal service can be emailed to school principals.  </p>

<p>The Governor made it clear that school meal service is an essential service.  Governor Whitmer’s office issued the following statement from Press Secretary Tiffany Brown:</p>

<p>"Gov. Whitmer is committed to ensuring that Michigan students have access to the food they need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the governor's executive order, K-12 school food services are considered critical infrastructure and should continue. The governor deeply appreciates the vital work that our frontline school employees are doing every day to ensure that our kids have the food they need while the order is in effect."</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges for our school community, state and country.  There is no doubt that many people are feeling increased anxiety and stress. Despite the difficulties, I am heartened by the way our school family and community are supporting others during this trying time.  I appreciate the efforts of school staff, parents and volunteers who have stepped up to do all they can wherever they can. Special thanks to our food service staff who are making sure our children are fed, and to our custodians, maintenance and other support staff who are diligent in ensuring all school spaces are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.   </p>

<p>Please adhere to the Governor’s Stay Home, Stay Safe executive order.  My hope is that our state and country will get this through this pandemic faster. And we can get our kids back to school.   We are Wildcat Strong and we will get through this together!</p>

        <h2>Marcellus Elementary</h2>

<p>March 23, 2020</p>

<p>Dear Marcellus Elementary Families,</p>

<p>As you may have already heard, Governor Whitmer has issued the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order that begins at midnight on March 24, 2020. This order is in place until at least April 13, 2020. During this time, Marcellus Community Schools will be offering only essential services. All buildings are closed and my staff, including myself, will not be onsite. The administration center will also be closed.</p>

<p>Marcellus Community Schools are committed to providing meals to our students during the closure. We are looking at alternatives as to how we distribute the meals currently. If a change were to occur, we would notify families via Bright Arrow, Facebook and our website. </p>

<p>When the immediate closure of schools was announced, our teachers gathered materials to send home to our students so learning opportunities could continue at home. Other teachers gathered materials and packets were mailed to the house. At this time, we will not be sending more work home for students. This week we will publish a list of online resources that our students may utilize during this unprecedented break from school. If you do not have internet accessibility for your student to use, I highly encourage you to keep them reading. Reading is one skill that can always be developed, and it will help to prevent what we typically call “summer slide’.  </p>

<p>If you need assistance or have questions, please refer to our website http://www.marcelluscs.org.  The website includes a special tab that includes updates from the district regarding COVID-19.  I can also be reached via email at tracy.spaulding@marcelluscs.org.</p>

<p>Please keep your family safe and know that your extended family at Marcellus Elementary is thinking of you as we are apart.</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Mrs. Tracy Spaulding</p>

<h2 class="data-driven-title fbcms_ec_titletext">March 16, 2020 Superintendent's Letter</h2>
<span class="fa fbcms_ec_titleicon"></span>
</div>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Governor Whitmer mandated that all Michigan schools be closed from March 16 through April 5. Due to our already scheduled spring break, Marcellus Community Schools will be closed through April 10th. Marcellus Community Schools, along with all schools across the state, has been diligently working to find ways to best support our students and families during this unprecedented and extended school closure.</p>

<p>I recognize the hardship this closure places on families. Please know that school personnel will do all that we can to assist families while also honoring the Governor’s mandate and Centers for Disease Control’s recommendations. Please read the important information below.</p>

<p>First, because school personnel recognize the limited connectivity that some of our students face, we do not have the option to continue classes through an online forum. For that reason, students were asked to take their books and/ or learning packets home on Friday. For obvious reasons, teachers and principals highly encourage students to continue learning during this closure. In addition to the paper- pencil work, students who are fortunate enough to have adequate internet at home may choose to complete some online activities. However, despite some social media comments to the contrary, neither online work nor paper-pencil book work are required by the school. The school simply wants to provide options for parents and students.</p>

<p>Second, parents whose students were absent on Friday, March 13, can make arrangements to pick up books or other necessary supplies or materials by calling the school office. Parents whose children have medication at the school should contact the school or central office to pick up the medication that will be needed at home. Medications that are not needed can remain at school. Please know that school officials will make every effort to accommodate parents who are unable to get to the school during typical school office hours.</p>

<p>Third, beginning March 18, Marcellus Community Schools will offer “Grab and Go” meal service for ALL children under the age of eighteen and for special needs students up to age twenty-six. (This includes homeschoolers and preschool students). Meals will be available, on Monday through Friday, at the Marcellus Middle/ High School main entrance vestibule AND at the old Marcellus Middle School (also called the Marcellus Community Education Center) from 11:30a.m.- 12:30 p.m. The meal will include the day’s lunch and breakfast for the next morning. Parents and/ or students do not have to personally pick up the meal. In fact, a friend, neighbor or other designee can pick up the meals each day. Those families who cannot make arrangements to pick up meals should contact the school right away as we may be able to<br>
arrange delivery.</p>

<p>Fourth, state testing is scheduled to begin the week of April 13. At this point, no changes to the state assessment schedule have been communicated to schools. Once the district learns of changes, if any, school personnel will communicate that to parents.</p>

<p>Finally, several have asked if school districts will be required to make up school days missed as a result of this closure. As of this writing, on March 15, 2020, the answer to that question is unclear. The legislature would need to approve a waiver to the currently required number of days and hours and districts are waiting for guidance from the Michigan Department of<br>
Education. Again, Marcellus Community Schools will communicate any changes to parents as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Please understand that this Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation is evolving rapidly. Thus, it is possible that things could change very quickly. Parents are asked to update contact information with their student’s respective school office to ensure receipt of any phone alerts that the district may send out during the closure.</p>

<p>If parents or students have additional questions about the closure, student learning opportunities, meal service, or anything else, please contact me or an appropriate staff member via email. Alternatively, parents may also call the school or central office at the numbers listed below.<br>
Elementary School- 269-646-9209<br>
Middle/ High School- 269-646-5081<br>
Volinia 269-646-9716<br>
Central Office- 646-7655<br>
If there is no answer, please leave a voicemail and your call will be returned.</p>

<p>One last important message to our school community- School personnel all learned of the extended school closure at the same time as parents and the rest of the public. I am extremely<br>
proud of the manner in which school staff managed this situation. I want to thank the amazing administrators, faculty and staff at Marcellus Community Schools. On short notice, all stepped up to get things done and to communicate to parents and students as quickly and effectively as possible- all to benefit our kids. In addition, I cannot adequately express my gratitude to those parents who, unsolicited, offered their assistance to make copies and help get learning packets prepared for students. I am also thankful for the many parents and community members who offered assistance to the school, students and community. We appreciate your understanding and support during this trying time. It takes a village and we have a great one!</p>

        <h2>A message from SMC for our dual enrolled students</h2>

<p>Southwestern Michigan College</p>

<p>March 15 at 12:11 PM · </p>

<p>Reminder: SMC classes will continue tomorrow, Monday, March 16, via the Moodle online platform. A limited number of course sections may still need to meet temporarily in-person for lab work or exams, but social distancing precautions and extra disinfection protocols will be observed in those few situations. All students, including dual-enrolled high school students, will be responsible for monitoring their online courses, submitting coursework on time and adhering to any directions or deadlines from professors.</p>

<p>All three residence halls and college offices on both campuses will remain open during typical business hours. Visitors will not be permitted in the residence halls and the Student Activity Center will be closed until further notice. At this time, The Birdfeeder and the Zollar Cafe will be open during usual hours for additional food options.</p>

<p>The Carole A. Tate Teaching and Learning Center will be requiring appointments for online and in-person consultations during this period. Computer resources are available in the Learning Centers of both campuses. In addition, campus wi-fi speeds have been boosted to handle the expected increased usage.</p>

<p>We have the utmost confidence that by all working together, we can ensure safety and student success. We challenge our students to persevere in their studies, to utilize our extensive campus resources, to stay in contact with their professors and to “finish strong.” Our dedicated faculty and staff will give their very best effort to serve our students at this time.</p>

<h2 class="data-driven-title fbcms_ec_titletext">March 15, 2020 Coronavirus Closure</h2>
<span class="fa fbcms_ec_titleicon"></span>
</div>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Governor Whitmer mandated that all Michigan schools be closed from March 16 through April 5.    Due to our already scheduled spring break, Marcellus Community Schools will be closed through <strong>April 10th.  </strong>Marcellus Community Schools, along with all schools across the state, has been diligently working to find ways to best support our students and families during this unprecedented and extended school closure.  <strong> </strong></p>

<p>I recognize the hardship this closure places on families.  Please know that school personnel will do all that we can to assist families while also honoring the Governor’s mandate and Centers for Disease Control’s recommendations.  Please read the important information below.</p>

<p>First, because school personnel recognize the limited connectivity that some of our students face, we do not have the option to continue classes through an online forum.  For that reason, students were asked to take their books and/ or learning packets home on Friday.   For obvious reasons, teachers and principals highly encourage students to continue learning during this closure.  In addition to the paper- pencil work, students who are fortunate enough to have adequate internet at home may choose to complete some online activities.   However, despite some social media comments to the contrary, neither online work nor paper-pencil book work are required by the school.  The school simply wants to provide options for parents and students.</p>

<p>Second, parents whose students were absent on Friday, March 13, can make arrangements to pick up books or other necessary supplies or materials by calling the school office.  Parents whose children have medication at the school should contact the school or central office to pick up the medication that will be needed at home.  Medications that are not needed can remain at school. Please know that school officials will make every effort to accommodate parents who are unable to get to the school during typical school office hours. </p>

<p>Third, beginning March 18, Marcellus Community Schools will offer “Grab and Go” meal service for ALL children under the age of eighteen and for special needs students up to age twenty-six. (This includes homeschoolers and preschool students). Meals will be available, on Monday through Friday, at the Marcellus Middle/ High School main entrance vestibule AND at the old Marcellus Middle School (also called the Marcellus Community Education Center) from 11:30a.m.- 12:30 p.m.  The meal will include the day’s lunch and breakfast for the next morning.  Parents and/ or students do not have to personally pick up the meal.  In fact, a friend, neighbor or other designee can pick up the meals each day.   Those families who cannot make arrangements to pick up meals should contact the school right away as we may be able to arrange delivery.</p>

<p>Fourth, state testing is scheduled to begin the week of April 13.  At this point, no changes to the state assessment schedule have been communicated to schools.  Once the district learns of changes, if any, school personnel will communicate that to parents.</p>

<p>Finally, several have asked if school districts will be required to make up school days missed as a result of this closure.  As of this writing, on March 15, 2020, the answer to that question is unclear.  The legislature would need to approve a waiver to the currently required number of days and hours and districts are waiting for guidance from the Michigan Department of Education.  Again, Marcellus Community Schools will communicate any changes to parents as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Please understand that this Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation is evolving rapidly.  Thus, <strong>it is possible that things could change very quickly. </strong> Parents are asked to update contact information with their student’s respective school office to ensure receipt of any phone alerts that the district may send out during the closure.</p>

<p>If parents or students have additional questions about the closure, student learning opportunities, meal service, or anything else, please contact me or an appropriate staff member via email.   Alternatively, parents may also call the school or central office at the numbers listed below.</p>

<p>Elementary School- 269-646-9209</p>

<p>Middle/ High School- 269-646-5081</p>

<p>Volinia 269-646-9716</p>

<p>Central Office- 646-7655</p>

<p>If there is no answer, please leave a voicemail and your call will be returned.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>One last important message to our school community-   School personnel all learned of the extended school closure at the same time as parents and the rest of the public. I am extremely proud of the manner in which school staff managed this situation. I want to thank the amazing administrators, faculty and staff at Marcellus Community Schools. On short notice, all stepped up to get things done and to communicate to parents and students as quickly and effectively as possible- all to benefit our kids.  In addition, I cannot adequately express my gratitude to those parents who, unsolicited, offered their assistance to make copies and help get learning packets prepared for students.  I am also thankful for the many parents and community members who offered assistance to the school, students and community.  We appreciate your understanding and support during this trying time.   It takes a village and we have a great one! </p>
