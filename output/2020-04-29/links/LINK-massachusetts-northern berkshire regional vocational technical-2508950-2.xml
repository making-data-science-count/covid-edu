                    <li>As on the traditional exam, questions on the 2020 AP Microeconomics Exam are designed such that required calculations can be done with a pencil and paper, with no calculator required. However, unlike the traditional exam, use of a simple (“four-function”) calculator, either physical or digital, is allowed. Such calculators are freely available as apps for computers and phones (i.e. most or all internet-connected devices), and can be installed beforehand for use on the exam. Keep in mind that students are required to show their work in answering calculation problems.</li>

<p>The Create performance task focuses on students developing computer programs and describing significant aspects of the program that allow it to run correctly.</p>
                  <p>Students have the flexibility to write programs that reflect their interests (e.g., their desire to solve a problem; program a game; or produce digital art appealing to a specific audience, etc.). This allows students to engage in the study of computer science from a creative perspective. Students will provide evidence of their knowledge of important programming concepts such as developing algorithms and using abstractions. Students are required to submit an individual program but are able to collaborate on the development of their program.</p>
</td>
                <td>
<p>The Explore performance task focuses on students using and applying computational analysis in the exploration of a significant computing innovation to determine and describe the impact of the innovation on people and society.</p>
                  <p>Students select and explore an innovation of their choosing. Then, they create a computational artifact about the innovation and describe how it works and how it is used, its purpose, how it consumes and/or produces data, and the harmful and beneficial effects of the innovation on people and society.</p>

                    <li>The student should take notes as they listen to the directions and the introduction. They will have 1 minute to prepare their thoughts on the topic and get ready to engage in the conversation, and then the interlocutor will begin the conversation.</li>
