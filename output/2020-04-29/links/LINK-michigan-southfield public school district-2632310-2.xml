    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p><strong>Determination of Critical Infrastructure Workers and Essential Employees Performing Necessary Government Activities</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, March 23, 2020, Governor Whitmer issued Executive Order No. 2020-21 (COVID-19) (the “Order”) ordering residents to remain at home to the maximum extent feasible. The Order is to “be construed broadly to prohibit in-person work that is not necessary to sustain or protect life.” The Order does not affect employees working remotely who are able and directed by their employers to work remotely from home, but it does contain exceptions for “critical infrastructure workers” and workers “whose presence is strictly necessary to enable, support, or facilitate the work of” critical infrastructure workers. With many school districts and intermediate school districts continuing to provide services, whether through virtual learning or meals for needy families, we have compiled the available guidance to date as to what public education employees might fall within these exceptions.</p>

<p>For Southfield Public Schools, the individuals listed below are considered <strong>Critical Infrastructure Workers and Essential Employees Performing Necessary Government Activities.</strong></p>

        <p>Dear Southfield Public Schools Family,</p>

<p>This morning Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced that Michigan schools would be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year for face-to-face instruction. While the decision was not the outcome any of us wished for, the safety of our students and staff is always our top priority and we fully support the Governor's decision to take all necessary measures to keep our school family and community safe. </p>

<p>This is a time of great uncertainty, and unfortunately, we do not have all of the answers right now.  However, here is what we do know.</p>

<ul>
<li>April 6, 2020, through April 10, 2020, we will pause instruction for Spring Recess. Instruction will resume on Monday, April 13, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A learning program that will include online learning, academic packets and other delivery methods to meet student needs will continue through the regularly scheduled last day of school in June.
	<ul>
<li>State guidance requires our district and all districts to submit a learning plan to the Oakland Intermediate School District (ISD) for approval. </li>
		<li>Once the Southfield Public Schools plan is finalized and approved, we will share it with the public.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>
<a href="https://www.southfieldk12.org/district/covid-19/#foodassistance" target="_blank">Meal distribution</a> will continue through the end of the school year in June.
	<ul>
<li>Please note that we will still provide food for the entire week, distributing meals for multiple days at once.  </li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure our entire Southfield Public Schools Family has many more questions about how this new landscape will impact our school community. As we learn more and finalize our plans, we will share that information in an upcoming virtual community forum (P.O.W.E.R. Hour) and on the <a href="https://www.southfieldk12.org/district/covid-19/" target="_blank">district website</a>. </p>

<p>We promise to do everything we can to ensure our students have the best educational experience possible moving forward.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.</p>

<p>Stay home, stay safe.</p>

<p> <br>
Sincerely,</p>

<p><br>
Dr. Jennifer Green<br>
Superintendent</p>

        <p>Greetings, Southfield Public Schools Community:</p>

<p>With Governor Whitmer’s Stay Home, Stay Safe announcement earlier this week, there will be a change to our meal distribution program. With the mandate, Southfield Public Schools will still distribute meals to our students and children under 18 in our community.</p>

        <p>Southfield Public Schools Families, </p>

<p>This evening the Office of the Superintendent was informed by the Director of Operations and Infrastructure that one of our contracted food handlers with Southwest Food Excellence (SFE), assigned to Southfield High School for the Arts &amp; Technology, reported a “high fever” on the evening of Saturday, March 21, 2020. At this time, the Office of the Superintendent has been in contact with SFE management who confirmed the food handler has indeed reported a condition of “high fever.” </p>

<p>SFE management has informed the Office of the Superintendent that all food handlers employed by SFE are required to wear protective gloves and masks when preparing and packing meals to be delivered to our Southfield Public Schools (SPS or district) students and community. Protective gear of the food handlers is a precautionary measure, and hospital-grade sanitizer/disinfectant is applied daily to all SPS kitchen surfaces, utensils, doorknobs, etc. at the end of each workday. </p>

<p>The food handler’s condition has been communicated with the Oakland County Health Department (OCHD). An OCHD communicable disease representative shared with the Office of the Superintendent for those experiencing high fever, without any of the other characteristics of the COVID-19, does not create exposure for those having been in previous contact with said individual. As an additional layer of precaution, the food handler was required to self-quarantine for no less than 14 days to ensure that the fever is not a precursor to the COVID-19.</p>

<p>At this juncture, SPS meal delivery to the community will continue as outlined on the <a href="https://www.southfieldk12.org/district/covid-19/" target="_blank">district’s website</a>. If and when additional data is received by the Office of the Superintendent, relative to the food handler, adjustments will be made to continue safe, healthy and responsive meal service to our community. </p>

<p><strong>Is the U.S. food supply safe?</strong><br>
According to the Food and Drug Administration (2020, March 17):</p>

<p class="indent1">Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of COVID-19.  Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like Norovirus and Hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.</p>

<p class="indent1">The Food and Drug Administration states that the virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. This includes between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. However, it’s always critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—clean, separate, cook, and chill – to prevent foodborne illness. </p>

<p class="indent1">(Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition - <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-during-emergencies/food-safety-and-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19" target="_blank">https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-during-emergencies/food-safety-and-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19</a>)</p>

<p>As always, Southfield Public Schools will continue to provide information to our community and take all the steps necessary for our community to be safe and well.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dr. Jennifer Green<br>
Superintendent</p>

        <p>Dear members of the Southfield Public Schools (SPS or district) community,<br><br>
On March 19, 2020, the district shared with staff that an individual within the SPS community reported positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19). The respective individual is a staff member whose work location is not housed in our school buildings. On March 20, 2020, the Office of Talent Management was informed that on March 16, 2020, the individual was physically present in the McIntyre and Vandenberg gymnasiums, for no more than five (5) minutes with no direct contact with staff and/or students in the aforementioned buildings. The Oakland County Health Department stated that the exposure risk to the general staff and student population is low. At this juncture, the staff member is self-quarantined at home.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening (March 20, 2020), a parent of our community self-reported to SPS administration that they were tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19). Presently, the parent awaits the results of the test and was directed by healthcare professionals to self-isolate at home. The parent was in MacArthur and Adler for student drop-off and pick-up on Thursday, March 12, 2020. Should the test return positive, the parent is to remain at home under extended self-quarantine for the next fourteen (14) days.</p>

<p>At the time of this announcement, the district has yet to receive confirmation from the Oakland County Health Department relative to the parent status update, but these are the first reported cases of COVID-19 at Southfield Public Schools. </p>

<p>The district recognizes and understands this announcement may cause you concern. Know that we will continue to do all that is possible to minimize the risk to the community.</p>

<p>We will continue to provide regular updates about the impact of the virus within our community via our <a href="https://www.southfieldk12.org/district/covid-19/" target="_blank">COVID-19 Updates</a> webpage. </p>

<p><strong>Your Safety and the Safety of Others</strong><br>
When Southfield Public Schools receives information regarding COVID-19 cases germane to our district, SPS administration immediately contacts the Oakland County Health Department (OCHD) and collaborates with them on next steps. The appropriate health authorities, in adherence to the Center for Disease Control protocols for COVID-19, conduct contact trace investigations. The contact trace investigation includes: interviewing/contacting/providing assistance directly to individuals with an elevated risk of exposure having been in close recent contact with someone testing positive for COVID-19. If contacted by the health authorities, you will be directed to self-quarantine for fourteen (14) days, monitor symptoms, and call health care providers if one should experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19. </p>

<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing fever, cough, or shortness of breath, with possible exposure to someone who has traveled or potentially exposed to COVID-19, please seek immediate medical help by calling your healthcare provider for medical advice.</p>

<p>Continue to practice and remind others to take necessary universal precautions. If you are not feeling well, or believe you have been exposed to the coronavirus, please follow the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html" target="_blank">CDC guidelines</a> and stay home. This virus is very contagious. If you are exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath), please call your primary healthcare provider for an immediate evaluation. Hand washing and social distancing are essential to mitigating the spread of this virus.  </p>

<p>Please take care of yourself.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Collaboratively,</p>

<p>Dr. Jennifer Green<br>
Superintendent</p>

        <p>Southfield Public Schools Families,</p>

<p>Last night, March 10, 2020, Governor Whitmer announced the first two confirmed cases of the Coronavirus, one of which is in Oakland County. With the safety and security of all students, staff, and community members as our top priority, we are constantly monitoring updates we received from local, state, and federal agencies and implementing their guidance. </p>

<p>The following decisions have been made based upon the information available today, March 11, 2020.</p>

<ul>
<li>All district field trips (in-state, out of state, and international) are suspended until further notice.</li>
	<li>Until further notice, all assemblies and performances involving participation by the general public are canceled. Assemblies during the school day that include only the students and staff of the building may be limited, at the discretion of the building principal or leader.</li>
	<li>All conferences (progress monitoring/parent-teacher) scheduled between now and spring recess are canceled. Families are encouraged to digitally connect with teachers for progress updates.</li>
	<li>Athletic competitions will continue as scheduled under the guidance of the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA). We will look to the MHSAA for ongoing guidance and connect with families if this guidance changes.</li>
	<li>Academic competitions will also continue under the guidance of the organizations hosting these events. We will continue to closely communicate with these governing bodies and communicate updated information as it becomes available.</li>
	<li>We are suspending all school tours for prospective families until further notice.</li>
	<li>We are suspending all field trips from other districts to our school facilities until further notice. Community events such as the P.O.W.E.R. Hour will be rescheduled.</li>
</ul>
<p>As updates become available from Governor Whitmer, the Oakland County Health Department, or an individual organization, such as MHSAA, etc., the district will review current thinking and make adjustments as necessary.  </p>

<p>As a reminder, all individuals should continue to take the following basic personal-hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the virus:</p>

<ul>
<li>wash your hands often with soap and water or use hand sanitizer; </li>
	<li>avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands; </li>
	<li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; </li>
	<li>avoid handshakes; </li>
	<li>avoid contact with sick people who are sick; and </li>
	<li>stay home when you are sick. </li>

        <p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>

<p>As the safety of our entire school community is paramount, we continue to monitor developments related to Coronavirus, or COVID-19.</p>

<p>Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Michigan, residents are still being urged by the Governor’s office to take all necessary precautions to prepare and keep themselves and their families safe. According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the risk of outbreak is low, but the State is still making preparations to limit the spread and impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Rest assured, Southfield Public Schools continues to work closely with and follow guidance from the Oakland County Health Division, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>The best prevention for COVID-19, and any other virus, such as the cold or flu, is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>If you are sick, please stay home and avoid contact with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Oakland County Health Division has provided the attached fact sheet to help address concerns. <a href="https://www.oakgov.com/health/information/PublishingImages/Pages/NovelCoronavirus/Download%20PDF%20Fact%20Sheeta.pdf" target="_blank">Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) What You Need to Know</a></p>
