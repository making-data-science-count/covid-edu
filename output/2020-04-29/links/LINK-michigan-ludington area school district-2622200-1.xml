        <p><strong>Updated Message from Superintendent Kennedy (April 24, 2020):</strong></p>

<p>The students and families of the Ludington Area School District continue to be on our minds as we work through this state mandated and unprecedented, yet necessary, closing of our school buildings. The District is offering an opportunity to connect with our families while surveying the needs of our school community, and collecting feedback on the operation of our programs during this time.</p>

<p>The students and families of the Ludington Area School District continue to be on our minds as we work through this state mandated and unprecedented, yet necessary, closing of our school buildings. While this building closure may have been in the best interest of the safety, health, and well-being of our entire school community, we know that this has created hardship for many of our families. We have worked hard to develop distance learning plans to support the continued learning needs of our students and their families during this difficult time, and we continue to provide meals and assistance to families. As an example, more than 38,000 meals have been served during this time to students!<br><br>
Please consider completing this survey as a way for the District to stay in touch with those in our community most impacted by this pandemic. We would love to know how you are doing, and please know that we will continue to work through this together! This survey will close to collecting responses on Friday, May 1, 2020, with additional follow up surveys being done throughout the remaining weeks of the school year. Thank you for taking the time to complete the District's survey!</p>

<p><strong>Updated Message from Superintendent Kennedy (April 2, 2020):</strong></p>

<p>The Governor's Executive Order was provided to local school districts this morning through e-mail approximately 10 minutes prior to the Governor's scheduled press conference. The Executive Order requires the Michigan Department of Education, in collaboration with the Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators, to develop and distribute a plan for districts to follow by April 3, 2020. The Executive Order then requires the West Shore Educational Service District to approve or reject district plans beginning on April 8, 2020.</p>

<p>Superintendents across the State have a town hall meeting with Governor Whitmer on Monday, April 6, 2020 and we expect to have more of our questions answered at that time. The West Shore Educational Service District is holding a principal's meeting tomorrow for principals to review the learning template mentioned above. The District will continue to work with District staff and have its plan submitted to the West Shore Educational Service District so that approval of that plan can take place as soon as possible according to the Executive Order.</p>

<p>We are hopeful to have our plan approved shortly thereafter April 8, 2020, with an implementation date of April 13, 2020, or sooner if the timing of the plan approval allows. This implementation date is dependent upon plan approval.</p>

<p>Full details of the plan will be released next week, as we work to ensure that the plan that we have been developing complies with the Governor's Executive Order, and it meets the needs of our students and families regarding the ability to equitably access the District's plan for the continuation of learning.</p>

        <p><strong>Updated Message from Superintendent Kennedy (March 30, 2020):</strong></p>

<p>Dear Oriole Family:</p>

<p>While these are definitely uncertain times, it is expected that the Governor will make announcements about the remainder of school for this year, along with several details that schools have been waiting on to put plans into action. That announcement may come as early as Tuesday, March 31, 2020. Many of the details have been finalized, although there are still some things being worked out at the state level as of this communication.</p>

<p>One thing is clear, in times of uncertainty, levels of stress and anxiety often increase in people. From the start, <span>LASD</span> has been committed to doing what we can to help take care of the basic needs of our students and the families that we serve. That is why a significant focus has been placed on providing thousands of meals every day to eligible students in our area. The need is great and we must take care of these needs before learning is maximized.</p>

<p>The next step that the District will be taking is to implement the attached student counseling, social work, and intervention support survey form. This form is intended to allow us to connect with students and families in need through either direct phone conversations, or through other technology platforms like Zoom or Google Hangouts.</p>

<p>Getting support mechanisms in place is critical to being able to roll out any type of at home learning plan to get us through the remainder of the year. Discussion of these types of plans has been taking place throughout Michigan as several states have recently released similar plans after being closed for the remainder of the school year. Details will be provided soon, but stay tuned to learn more information as it is released this week. Please know that our first priority is to take care of the basic needs and well-being of our students and families.</p>

<p>If you have a student that is in need of counseling, social work, or intervention support focused on the social and emotional well-being of your child, please complete this form and we will do our best to connect you with one of the District's providers. Thank you for all of your patience through these difficult times.</p>

<p>Student counseling, social work, and intervention request form: <a href="https://forms.gle/ijq7hXjdF3axmk4D7" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/ijq7hXjdF3axmk4D7</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:13px">Updated Message from Superintendent Kennedy (March 27, 2020):</strong></p>

<p>Dear Class of 2020:<br>
While there is no doubt that we are in uncertain times, please know that we care deeply about you and the impact that you have had on <span>Ludington</span> Area Schools and our greater school community.</p>

<p>I have heard from many that concerns exist about graduation and the celebration of all of your accomplishments over the last several years. We continue to be in discussion with legislative leaders, the Michigan Department of Education, and leaders around the state from other schools just like <span>Ludington</span>.<br><br>
As we learn more, of which I expect to hear more within the next week or so, please know that we will be in touch with each of you about end of year activities.<br><br>
Without question, we will celebrate all of your accomplishments, and we will hold a graduation ceremony at a time that we are able to do so. Please stay in communication with your teachers and the school, be on the lookout for a communication to be sent to you soon, and stay positive through all of this. We will do our best to support you through these unprecedented times and know that we care deeply about you! Thank you for being an Oriole! Go O’s!</p>

<p><strong>Updated Message from Superintendent Kennedy (March 26, 2020):</strong></p>

<p>While the Governor's Executive Order closes school buildings to students for instructional purpose, and may not apply to the use of school playground equipment for recreational purposes, public access to playgrounds may contribute to increasing the spread of <span>COVID</span>- 19. Playgrounds are not being sanitized and should not be used until further notice. Therefore, playgrounds have been closed by the District. Please be advised that members of the community who continue to use playground and recreational spaces owned by the District do so at their own risk.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Message from Superintendent Kennedy (March 23, 2020):</strong></p>

<p>As you likely are aware, Governor <span>Whitmer</span> has issued Executive Order 2020-21, effective at 12:01 am on Tuesday, March 24, 2020.</p>

<p>This stay at home order temporarily requires the suspension of activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life, and applies to the operation of schools. This means that the state mandated school closure has been extended through this Executive Order, which expires at 11:59 pm on April 13, 2020. While I know that there are lots of questions pertaining to school, please know that the Governor shared that there will be more to follow on this topic in a future press conference that she will hold. We will update you as we learn more.</p>

<p>Please know that we are working to understand the order and its impact on our operation, and we will continue to keep our greater school community informed. As we learn more from the Michigan Department of Education, the Governor and the Executive Office, and our Legislature, we will provide those updates to you.</p>

<p>We are also working to understand the impact that this order, as well as other guidance from state and federal agencies has on our food service program and other services provided by the District. As we learn more, again, we will be in touch. For now, please know that the school closure has been extended by this Executive Order, which is linked to this message. Stay safe and stay healthy!</p>

<p><strong>Updated Message from Superintendent Kennedy (March 16, 2020):</strong></p>

<p>The students and families of the <span>Ludington</span> Area School District are on our minds as we work through this state mandated and unprecedented, yet necessary, school closure. While this closure is in the best interest of the safety, health, and well-being of our entire school community, we know that this creates hardship for many of our families. Please complete this survey as a way for the District to stay in touch with those in our community most impacted by this school closure. We would love to know that you are either doing alright, but also be glad to help how we are able to if your family is experiencing a hardship. We will get through this together! It is great to be an Oriole!</p>

<p>This evening, Governor <span>Whitmer</span> announced that in order to slow the spread of Novel Coronavirus (<span>COVID</span>-19) in Michigan, she is ordering the closure of all K-12 school buildings, public, private, and boarding, to students starting Monday, March 16 until Sunday, April 5.

<p>Significant planning and additional preparation will occur through the evening tonight and throughout the day tomorrow, with additional communication taking place with families tomorrow. As we learn more about the details relating to the mandated school closure, we will be sure to share those with you.</p>

<p>In the meantime, all student extracurricular events and practices will be canceled or postponed, effective immediately, through the mandated closure.  Stay tuned for more information pertaining to the school closure and know that we are appreciative of your patience as we work through this. </p>

<p><strong>Message from Superintendent Kennedy (March 11, 2020):</strong></p>

<p><strong>American Red Cross Blood Drives Hawley Gymnasium</strong></p>

<p>In healthcare settings all across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations during this pandemic. The CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. The CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time. The American Red Cross has been deemed an essential medical function and Ludington Area Schools is glad to support this mission to protect and save lives.</p>

<p>As a result, Hawley Gymnasium will be used periodically to support blood drives in our community. Members of the District's custodial staff, maintenance staff, and Randy Fountain will be designated as members of the essential workforce to support each of the blood drives hosted by Ludington Area Schools on behalf of the American Red Cross. Below you will find documents provided to the District by the American Red Cross:</p>
