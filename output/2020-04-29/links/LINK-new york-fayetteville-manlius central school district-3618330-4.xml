<h2>NYSPHSAA cancels spring state championships</h2>
<p><strong>April 27</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State Public High School Athletic Association (<a href="http://www.nysphsaa.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NYSPHSAA</a>) officials announced today that all spring athletic championships have been canceled due to the public health situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s decision is difficult for the membership of NYSPHSAA,” said NYSPHSAA Executive Director Robert Zayas. “We certainly sympathize with the students, coaches and their school communities, especially the graduating seniors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cancelation impacts boys and girls track and field, tennis, softball, baseball, golf and lacrosse state championships that were scheduled for June 4-13, 2020. NYSPHSAA stated the decision to cancel was based on several factors, including time, feasibility, and venue availability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of April 27, the regular spring sports season remains on hold for nine of NYSPHSAA’s 11 sections. Sections VIII and XI, which are located in Suffolk and Nassau counties, announced regular season cancelations last week. Individual sections have the authority to determine whether to hold regular season contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for students to participate in sports this spring, schools will need to be reopened by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, according to NYSPHSAA. The organization also states that the date students return to school will play a significant role in the possibility of a regular spring sports season.</span></p>

<h2>Board adopts budget proposal and braces for potential mid-year state aid cuts</h2>
<p><strong>April 23</strong></p>
<p>The Fayetteville-Manlius School District is bracing for a challenging budget year for 2020-21 as the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a state budget gap that New York state officials are partially filling with monies that had been promised to schools. </p>
<p>The adopted state budget freezes the district’s base operating aid—foundation aid—at the current school year’s level, which is $250,000 less than what had been allocated to the F-M district when the governor released his executive budget proposal in January, before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. </p>
<p>In addition to less state aid for schools in the adopted state budget, the governor has forecast possible mid-year budget reductions for schools statewide. </p>
<p>In response, F-M officials are proposing an $88.30 million operating budget for 2020-21 that includes such reductions as fewer field trips, elimination of the district’s annual summer census and a reduction in certain areas of athletics spending. </p>
<p>“Our strategic plan served as a guide as we developed this budget proposal against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Superintendent Craig J. Tice said. “We recognize the significant impact it is having on state and local finances and our community members. As such, this budget proposal includes reductions in spending where there would be the least impact on the district’s instructional programming and ongoing security enhancements.” </p>
<p>On April 20, the F-M Board of Education adopted the budget proposal. </p>
<h3>Tax levy increase is at district’s ‘cap’</h3>
<p>The district has two primary revenue sources: state aid and the property tax levy. The tax levy is the total amount of money the district collects from property owners within the district to support the school budget. </p>
<p>State aid would support 22.80% of the proposed budget while the tax levy would support 74.30%. Sources such as interest income would account for the remaining 2.90% of the district’s anticipated revenue.  </p>
<p>Compared to the current school year’s budget, the district is proposing a tax levy increase of 3.33%, which includes a 2.24% increase to fund ongoing programs and a 1.09% increase to cover capital project debt related to recently completed projects at Enders Road Elementary School, F-M High School and Fayetteville Elementary School. </p>
<p>The levy increase is at the district’s tax levy limit, or cap, so a simple majority of voters will be required to authorize the proposal. </p>
<h3>Foundation aid is flat for 2020-21</h3>
<p>New provisions in the state budget contribute to uncertainty for school districts as they plan for the next school year. The provisions include three periodic reviews of state revenue that could result in mid-year school aid cuts. There is also a new “Pandemic Adjustment” state aid reduction that the state is using to help fill its budget gap. </p>
<p>F-M is losing $170,000 in state aid due to the Pandemic Adjustment, and while federal stimulus dollars will replace those funds, the possibility for mid-year aid cuts means that schools may receive even less state funding than was promised in the adopted state budget. In response, F-M is budgeting for an additional loss of state aid in the amount of $500,000. </p>
<p>“The COVID-19 crisis is having far-reaching impacts across the state, including drastically impacting educational funding,” said William Furlong, the district’s assistant superintendent for business services. “The governor has said school districts could see further reductions in state aid so we developed a budget proposal that takes this uncertainty into account while preserving the integrity of our academic programs and balancing our fiscal responsibility to our taxpayers.”</p>
<p>Because the district has not been operating as it typically would, officials have identified a number of potential budget reductions totalling $1.1 million in the areas of transportation, utilities, maintenance, conferences, supplies and equipment that will help offset mid-year reductions in state aid. </p>
<h3>Tax rate estimated to be less than 0.50%</h3>
<p>The school tax levy is just one factor, along with assessment rates and equalization rates, that municipalities use to determine residents’ tax rates, which are used to calculate what each property owner will ultimately pay in school taxes. </p>
<p>The tax rate is typically less than the tax levy because of growth in the property tax base. </p>
<p>The district estimates that the proposed 3.33% school tax levy increase would generate a tax rate increase of about 0.50% for town of Manlius residents. (The town of Manlius makes up the majority of homeowners within the school district.) </p>
<h3>Budget vote and board elections delayed</h3>
<p>School leaders are still awaiting a rescheduled date and process for the budget vote and board member elections. An executive order delayed the vote and elections until at least June 1. The state has not yet released additional guidance related to the budget vote and board member elections. The district will communicate this information once it is available. </p>

<h2>District strives to keep students, parents connected</h2>
<p><strong>April 22</strong></p>
<p>As teaching and learning continues to take place virtually, Fayetteville-Manlius School District is focusing on keeping students and parents connected to school.</p>
<p>“This is undeniably a stressful time for families,” F-M Superintendent Craig J. Tice said. “It’s important for students, parents and guardians to know that we are here for them.”</p>
<p>When F-M launched its remote learning system last month, the district’s focus was on making sure students could access technology at home during the school closure period. This included loaning hundreds of Chromebooks to students who needed them and troubleshooting any learning platform issues that students were experiencing.</p>
<p>Now, with online-based instruction in full swing, the district’s priority is making sure students are engaging in learning, completing assignments and staying in touch with their teachers.</p>
<p>“We know some families might be facing extra burdens right now,” Dr. Tice said. “Conversations can help us find out students’ needs as we progress with digital school routines.”</p>
<p>Dr. Tice said maintaining a home and school connection is important not only to assess progress, but also so that educators can celebrate students’ successes, share good news and acknowledge academic gains.</p>
<p>“Relationships are the foundation of our classrooms,” Dr. Tice said. “We are physically distant, but the emotional connection is still there.”</p>
<p>F-M parents, guardians and students can email teachers and staff members directly or use Schoology’s messaging feature to send a note. Staff continue to monitor their school voicemail messages and are promptly returning calls. Parents and students can use the two-way interactive communications platform,<span> </span><a href="https://www.k12insight.com/Lets-Talk/Dialogue.aspx?k=WR3D9YLT@DYXZ4G2LT" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Let’s Talk</a><span> </span>to submit general feedback, concerns and questions. Messages submitted via Let’s Talk are sent directly to Dr. Tice.</p>
<p>“The more we know, the better we can serve our school community,” Dr. Tice said.</p>

<h2>District seeks community support for federal funding</h2>
<p><strong>April 21</strong></p>
<p>During a recent news briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that without more federal assistance, it might be necessary to cut state funding for education.</p>
<p>“If the federal government doesn’t provide more aid, New York’s financial plan this week will forecast 20 percent cuts to schools, local governments and hospitals,” Gov. Cuomo said on Monday.</p>
<p>Senator leaders Bob Menendez (New Jersey) and Bill Cassidy (Louisiana) are proposing a $500 billion fund package for state and local governments as part of the next comprehensive rescue package from Congress. The package will aid states, local governments and public schools that are reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In an effort to support Fayetteville-Manlius School District students and educators, community members can advocate for the stabilization fund by contacting the district’s Congress representatives:</p>
<p><a href="https://katko.house.gov/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Honorable John Katko</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.schumer.senate.gov/contact/office-locations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Senator Charles Schumer</a></p>
<p>The following talking points can be used in correspondence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please support the bi-partisan proposal by Senators Menendez and Cassidy to deliver $500 billion in federal aid to states, local governments, and public schools.</li>
<li>Without more help from Washington, it will not be possible for our state to avoid drastic cuts in school funding.</li>
<li>Federal aid needs to do more than just allow the state to avoid cutting its funding.</li>
<li>Please support additional federal aid to our state and our schools.<br><hr>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>May Parent Council canceled</h2>
<p><strong>April 20</strong></p>
<p>The May 1 Parent Council meeting is canceled due to the emergency school closure.</p>
<p>The next meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. June 1 in the F-M District Office large conference room. As of today, the district is scheduled to return to session on Monday, May 18.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fmschools.org/parent-resources/parent-council/">Parent Council</a> is a forum for Fayetteville-Manlius School District parents to meet informally with the superintendent and other district staff to discuss topics relevant to its students. The sessions are informal and open, and parents are an integral part of discussions that occur.</p>
<p>The June 1 meeting will feature the School Budget (from the canceled May 1 meeting). The meeting will focus on an overview of the school budget in advance of the new budget vote date established by the governor.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Board meeting to be livestreamed</h2>
<p><strong>April 17</strong></p>
<p>Fayetteville-Manlius School District’s April 20 board of education meeting will be available for real-time viewing online.</p>
<p>Amid concerns of the COVID-19 public health crisis, New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently issued an executive order exempting municipal and school boards from provisions of the state Open Meetings Law that require public access to locations where government meetings are conducted.</p>
<p>To comply with this order, the F-M Board of Education’s April 20 meeting will be available for public viewing and participation via YouTube Live only. The meeting will stream in real-time on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCidM6tf7c3pRsKChZSfrfhg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">F-M’s official YouTube channel</a> beginning at 6 p.m. and will be archived on the channel for later viewing.</p>
<p>The meeting agenda will include time for public comment, which viewers can participate in through YouTube Live Chat. An interactive chat window will be accessible to online audience members during this portion of the meeting. The chat window will be disabled at the conclusion of the meeting’s public comment session.</p>
<p>Board members and district leaders will be participating in the meeting through the use of telephone conferencing. Those district officials in attendance at the broadcast site to manage the telecommunications will practice social distancing. </p>

<p><strong>April 16</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced during his April 16 press briefing that New York state will remain “on pause” through May 15 to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of this order, New York state schools, including Fayetteville-Manlius School District, will remain closed through at least May 15. The governor could extend the closure again if he feels it is necessary to contain COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students and staff will continue with their remote education activities and routines, and the district’s food service department will continue offering pre-packaged breakfast and lunch meals so that students have access to nutritional foods each day school is closed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meals are provided at no cost to F-M students regardless of family income. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families who have not already signed up for the meal service should contact F-M’s Food Service Director at 315-692-1809 or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">catering@fmschools.org</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2>College Board cancels May  and June SAT</h2>
<p><strong>April 15</strong></p>
<p>In response to the coronavirus pandemic, The College Board recently announced it will not administer the SAT exams and SAT Subject Tests that were scheduled for May and June. The College Board also cannot provide April administrations for the PSAT 10 and PSAT 8/9 exams thus ensuring that there will not be opportunities for PSAT testing this spring.</p>

<h2>District secures school trip refunds and credits</h2>
<p><strong>April 14</strong></p>
<p>Refunds for three out-of-state school trips that were canceled due to coronavirus concerns will be issued to Fayetteville-Manlius School District parents and guardians.</p>
<p>Since the start of the school closure period, F-M administrators and teacher leaders have been working behind-the-scenes with travel agencies to secure refunds and credits for students impacted by educational trip cancellations. Three overnight trips – F-M High School’s music trip to Orlando, the Eagle Hill eighth-grade trip to Boston, and the Wellwood eighth-grade trip to Philadelphia – were scheduled to take place during the extended school closure period.</p>
<p>“We know how hard families work to invest in their child’s academic experiences,” F-M Superintendent Craig J. Tice said. “Administrators quickly turned their attention to these canceled trips so they could secure refunds and/or airfare travel credits on behalf of students and families.”</p>
<p>F-M families affected by the canceled trips will be contacted by school personnel to discuss next steps.</p>
<p><strong>Communications portal remains open</strong></p>
<p>With all F-M schools closed until at least April 29, the district recognizes many parents, guardians and students have questions about how this extended closure will affect the school community.</p>
<p>The community is encouraged to use the district’s Let’s Talk! platform to submit questions and concerns to the district. Let’s Talk! is a web-based, two-way communications tool that allows anyone to share concerns or questions with district administrators at any time.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Check out district’s social media channels</h2>
<p><strong>April 13</strong></p>
<p>With the statewide school closures extended through at least April 29, the Fayetteville-Manlius School District recognizes that it is more important than ever for our students and teachers to feel connected to each other and the community at large.</p>
<p>One way the district is continuing to build community is through its social media channels. The district has Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts and frequently shares news and information on those platforms about student and staff achievements, projects and initiatives.</p>
<p>During this time of uncertainty, the district is focusing on sharing information to help fuel students’ feelings of connectedness to the F-M school community, such as read-alouds from our school resource officers and service projects students are taking of their own initiative to help out our community during this COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<h2>Wellwood construction to begin</h2>
<p><strong>April 9</strong></p>
<p>Community members will soon begin to see activity at Wellwood Middle School as contractors start work on the final phase of the Fayetteville-Manlius School District’s 2017 voter-approved capital project.</p>
<p>The district’s law firm received approval on April 6 from Empire State Development, the state’s Department of Economic Development, for the school district to move forward with its planned construction at Wellwood. </p>
<p>Construction personnel who will be working on site will be responsible for maintaining appropriate social distance and complying with state Department of Health (DOH) guidance and directives for maintaining a clean and safe work environment. </p>
<p>The district’s project manager also will be on site overseeing construction, as well as working with the contractors in order to ensure that they have amended their safety plans to include the requisite DOH guidance.</p>
<p>Wellwood is the district’s oldest building, with portions dating back to 1933. Construction will include a 15,000-square-foot addition and new main entrance facing Fayetteville Elementary School, creation of a new, enlarged parking lot in front of the addition, new athletic fields and renovations to existing classrooms, including asbestos abatement and infrastructure upgrades.</p>
<p>Since the governor closed schools statewide through at least April 29 to mitigate COVID-19 spread, the district is taking advantage of Wellwood being closed to students and staff to have contractors begin to work on the improvements, including asbestos abatement projects that had originally been planned to take place during the next two summers. </p>
<p>In March, the F-M Board of Education approved bids in the amount of $24.9 million for Wellwood’s portion of the $45.2 million total project, which includes an addition at Enders Road Elementary, <a href="https://www.fmschools.org/enders-road-addition-officially-open-for-business/">which was completed in September</a>, and a <a href="https://www.fmschools.org/f-m-high-school-unveils-newly-renovated-library-media-center/">renovation of F-M High School’s bathrooms and library media center</a> that students and staff began using in November. The project also includes energy efficiency improvements district wide.</p>

<h2>State cancels Regents exams, modifies graduation requirements</h2>
<p><strong>April 7</strong><br>
On April 7, the New York State Education Department (NYSED) officially canceled this year’s Regents examinations that were scheduled for June and announced new graduation requirements.</p>
<p>The graduation requirements students ordinarily must meet in order to earn diplomas, credentials and endorsements were adjusted so that students will not be adversely impacted by the absence of Regents testing.</p>
<p>Students who meet one or more of the following eligibility requirements are exempt from the examinations they were planning to take in June:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student is currently enrolled in a course of study culminating in a Regents<br>
examination and will have earned credit in such course of study by the end of the 2019-20 school year;</li>
<li>The student is in grade 7, is enrolled in a course of study culminating in a Regents examination and will have passed such course of study by the end of the 2019-20 school year;</li>
<li>The student is currently enrolled in a course of study culminating in a Regents<br>
examination and has failed to earn credit by the end of the school year. Such student returns for summer instruction to make up the failed course credit and is subsequently granted diploma credit in August 2020; or</li>
<li>The student was previously enrolled in the course of study leading to an applicable Regents examination, has achieved course credit, and has not yet passed the associated Regents examination but was intending to take the test in June 2020 to achieve a passing score.</li>
</ul>
<p>This cancellation applies to all Regents examinations that were scheduled for the June 2020 testing period. Student transcripts will not reflect an exam score for any examination for which the student is exempted, NYSED said.</p>

<h2>School closure extended through April 29; June Regents exams will be canceled</h2>
<p>
<strong>April 6</strong><br>
Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced during his press briefing today that New York state will remain “on pause” through the end of the month to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>As part of this order, New York state schools, including Fayetteville-Manlius School District, will remain closed through April 29.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons the rate of infection is going down is because social distancing is working,” Cuomo said during the briefing.</p>
<p>June Regents exams will be officially canceled tomorrow<br>
New York State Board of Regents Chancellor Betty Rosa announced today that the Regents examinations scheduled for June will be canceled.</p>
<p>New York State Board of Regents met April 6 to act on a series of emergency regulations regarding the recent coronavirus pandemic. The Board of Regents will make an official announcement tomorrow, April 7, to formally cancel the exams and provide guidance on what this means for students and schools with respect to graduation requirements.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has put a tremendous burden on many New Yorkers and our schools and children are no exception,” Rosa said during the video conference. “The regulations passed by the Board today will allow schools, students and professionals much-needed flexibility while they adapt to this rapidly evolving situation.”</p>
<p>During today’s meeting, Rosa did not indicate whether this cancelation applies to the August Regents exams.</p>

<h2>Some construction projects continue during school closure</h2>
<p><strong>April 3</strong><br>
While schools are closed statewide due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fayetteville-Manlius School District is taking advantage of its buildings being unoccupied to continue and, in some cases, move up scheduled “essential” construction projects.</p>
<p>Electrical work at Fayetteville Elementary School will continue over the district’s previously planned spring break (April 6-10). In preparation for upcoming construction at Wellwood Middle School that is part of the <a href="https://www.fmschools.org/departments-services/buildings-and-grounds/facilities-project/">2017 voter-approved capital project</a>, the district is separating the electrical service that is shared by Fayetteville Elementary and Wellwood Middle schools into two distinct systems.</p>
<p>With separate main power lines installed to both buildings, power outages at one building will no longer impact the other, as is currently the case.</p>
<p>Other work at Wellwood is on hold due to a delay in the delivery of the modular classroom suite that will be used for temporary classroom space during construction. The district had planned for a June delivery; however, the company constructing the suite is currently shut down due to the pandemic. Once the company resumes construction, the district will adjust its project timeline and notify parents and staff.</p>
<p>In addition to the electrical work at Fayetteville Elementary during the week of April 6-10, asbestos abatement is also planned for that time at Eagle Hill Middle School. The abatement project is part of the Energy Performance Contract (EPC) that is included in the 2017 capital project. Air monitoring is required before, during and after all asbestos abatement projects.</p>
<p>If the governor extends beyond April 15 the school closure period, asbestos abatement at F-M High School, which is also part of the EPC, will take place immediately following the Eagle Hill work, rather than at the end of June as originally scheduled.  </p>

<h2>EH sends messages of appreciation to essential workers</h2>
<p><strong>April 2</strong></p>
<p>As schools across New York state continue to be closed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, it’s important that members of the Fayetteville-Manlius School District feel connected to each other and the greater community.</p>
<p>At Eagle Hill Middle School, students and staff recently created positive messages that were shared electronically with local emergency responders, grocery store workers and medical providers. As COVID-19 afflicts more people in our community, the students and staff wanted these essential workers to know that the work they are doing is appreciated.</p>
<p>Here are some of their messages that were sent to local hospitals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for being a LIGHT in these uncertain times! Your hard work is appreciated more than you know!</li>
<li>I value and appreciate your time, energy and dedication. Thank you for everything you do!!</li>
<li>Thank you for all that you do. I am glad that you have the courage to work because everyone needs you. You do a dangerous job but you aren’t scared to help our community.</li>
<li>Thank you for your service by helping us get better when we get sick. You make a big difference in the world.</li>

<div data-url="https://www.fmschools.org/april-1-covid-19-update-mental-health-resources-available/"></div>
<p><span>“Students are experiencing many life changes at once due to the pandemic,” F-M Superintendent Craig J. Tice said. “We recognize that current news headlines, social distancing measures and a lack of routine can trigger different emotions. We are here to help students cope with these changes.”</span></p>
<p><span>F-M school counselors, social workers, psychologists and home-school liaisons are available to speak personally with students, parents and guardians by phone, email and video chat. To set up an individual appointment with a school mental health professional at any of the district’s six school buildings, please email F-M Director of Counseling Services Heidi Green at </span><a href="mailto:hgreen@fmschools.org"><span>hgreen@fmschools.org</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><b>Community resources available for families</b></p>
<p><span>In addition to school mental health personnel, there are several community resources available to help families through this period of uncertainty. </span></p>
<p><span>Individuals who are experiencing increasing stress and anxiety can contact New York State Office of Mental Health’s free <a href="https://omh.ny.gov/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Emotional Support Line</a> at 1-844-863-9314.

<p><span>Centers for Disease Control provides news, information and resources related to the global pandemic on its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">website</a>. The CDC offers the following tips for parents and guardians who are helping children navigate through these unsettling times: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.</span></li>
<li><span>Reassure your child or teen that they are safe. Let them know it is ok if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you.</span></li>
<li><span>Limit your family’s exposure to news coverage of the event, including social media. Children may misinterpret what they hear and can be frightened about something they do not understand.</span></li>
<li><span>Try to keep up with regular routines. Create a schedule for learning activities and relaxing or fun activities.</span></li>
<li>
<span><span>Be a role model. Take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well. Connect with your friends and family members.</span></span><br><span></span>

<h2>Remote learning, food distribution continues next week</h2>
<p><strong>March 31</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s update is a letter to F-M families from Superintendent Craig Tice regarding the governor’s executive orders issued to extend the school closure period until April 15, 2020.  </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear F-M parents and guardians,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing COVID-19 public health crisis, Fayetteville-Manlius School District remains committed to providing students with equitable learning opportunities and access to healthy meals while school is closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you are aware, Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently extended the New York on PAUSE plan and directed schools to remain closed until at least April 15. During this extension, districts are expected to provide continuity of learning and food service to students and child care for its essential workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the extended executive order encompasses the district’s upcoming Spring Recess, which was previously scheduled for April 6-10, F-M’s academic calendar has been amended by executive order so that staff members can continue to support students with remote learning opportunities and food distribution during this timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, students should continue their remote educational activities and routines next week, and those enrolled in F-M Food Service Department’s healthy meals program will continue to receive breakfast and lunch each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the loss of planned vacation time would not be welcome news during a typical school year, we recognize that this is anything but a typical school year. Since the health, safety and education of students remain the district’s top priorities, the governor’s commitment to maintaining the “continuity” of learning, food service and child care is understandable.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enroll your child in F-M’s healthy meal program, which offers grab-and-go breakfast and lunch meals for all students on each weekday school is closed, please contact F-M’s Food Service Department at 315-692-1809 or </span><a href="mailto:catering@fmschools.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">catering@fmschools.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please indicate which school is most convenient for meal pick-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recognize that this is a stressful and challenging situation. We’re here to support you through it, and know that you are managing many personal and professional responsibilities. We would like to remind you of something that we often tell our students: All we can do is our best. We’ll get through this together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you all for your continued patience, understanding and support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craig J. Tice, Ph.D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintendent of Schools</span></p>

<h2>Budget vote postponed until at least June 1; recreational spaces remain closed</h2>
<p><strong>March 30, 2020</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under an executive order from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, all New York state school budget votes originally scheduled for May 19 have been postponed until at least June 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive, which aims to limit the spread of COVID-19, also indefinitely postpones collection and filing of nominating petitions for school board elections and postpones library votes and municipal elections to at least June 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district will provide more information about F-M’s annual school budget vote once it becomes available.</span></p>
<h3><strong>School playgrounds and fields remain closed</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To comply with the Onondaga County Executive’s social distancing directives, F-M’s outdoor physical education spaces, recreational facilities and athletic fields remain closed until further notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes F-M school playgrounds, tennis courts and athletic fields. F-M High School’s athletic stadium, including its turf field and track are also closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the various deterrents used to secure or to limit access to these facilities, conspicuous signage has been posted authorizing law enforcement to intervene on behalf of the school district and to hold any trespassers accountable for their actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county order has been issued to help limit the spread of COVID-19. The district will notify community members once F-M’s facilities and fields reopen for public use.</span></p>
<h3><strong>State education department approves district’s emergency plans </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State Education Department recently approved the district’s plans for how it will provide <a href="https://www.fmschools.org/covid-19-update-and-information-all-f-m-schools-closed-effective-monday-march-16/">learning</a> opportunities, <a href="https://www.fmschools.org/march-25-covid-19-update-food-service-expands-program-to-include-all-f-m-students/">healthy meals</a> and <a href="https://www.fmschools.org/march-26-covid-19-update-ocfs-survey-helps-connect-parents-to-childcare/">child care</a> for its essential employees during the school closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plans have been implemented districtwide and will remain in effect for the duration of the school closure.</span></p>

<h2>Schools closed until April 15; EH teachers help make face shields for healthcare workers</h2>
<p><strong>March 27</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 27, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that he is extending to April 15 his executive order to close schools to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fayetteville-Manlius schools were already closed through April 13 due to an executive order from Onondaga County; however, schools will now reopen on April 15 due to the governor’s announcement. Cuomo said in two weeks he will re-evaluate his order to close schools and may extend the closure at that time, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district is closely monitoring federal, state and local guidance and is preparing to extend its existing contingency plans for instruction, student support services, childcare and the delivery of school meals in case the school closure is extended past April 14.  </span></p>
<h3>Supporting the community through tech</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Eagle Hill Middle School teachers are helping the community by 3D printing face shield parts to be donated to healthcare workers treating individuals infected with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading a </span><a href="https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-central-ny-movie-studio-needs-volunteers-to-make-face-shields-for-healthcare-workers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">syracuse.com article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a local company asking for volunteers to help 3D print and assemble face shields, Eagle Hill technology teachers Bob Levy and Matt Six saw a community need they could help meet with school technology currently not in use because of the emergency school closure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The least we could do for our community is try and pitch in to help our healthcare workers that are on the front lines of this epidemic,” Six said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They reached out to Principal Maureen McCrystal to ask if they could each take one of the school’s 3D printers home, along with some filament, so they could support the group’s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a check-in with district administration, it was determined that their efforts would fall within board policy on equipment use, and that the cost to produce the parts would be minimal and not adversely impact the school’s ability to replace the school’s supply of filament. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levy and Six are printing two parts for the face shields: the visor and clip. They began printing March 26 and delivered 6 visor parts that day and estimate they will be able to create and donate a total of at least 16 a day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After seeing news reports about front line doctors and nurses reusing personal protective equipment that is meant to be disposed of after each use, and the local effort to get more equipment distributed to local hospitals, I knew we could do our part to help out,” Levy said. “I thought, we have the equipment, materials and capability to help out on behalf of the F-M community, so let’s get printing.”</span></p>
<h3>April Parent Council canceled</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The April 1 Parent Council meeting is canceled due to the emergency school closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. May 1 in the F-M District Office large conference room. As of today, the district is scheduled to return to session on April 15. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parent Council is a forum for Fayetteville-Manlius School District parents to meet informally with the superintendent and other district staff to discuss topics relevant to its students. The sessions are informal and open, and parents are an integral part of discussions that occur.</span></p>

<h2>OCFS survey helps connect parents to childcare</h2>
<p><strong>March 26</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Fayetteville-Manlius School District is partnering with the Hal Welsh East Area YMCA in Fayetteville to provide childcare for children of essential employees, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) is also available to help those in need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staff at OCFS are trying their best to support families in finding high-quality childcare. Parents or caregivers who need childcare are asked to complete an </span><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3HSNNYJ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OCFS parent need for child care survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The survey is currently in English, but it is currently being translated and translations will follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the information you provide about your job, employer, number of children and financial need, OCFS may be able to help you find the childcare program you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locally, Child Care Solutions of Central New York is available to assist families in finding childcare to meet their family’s needs. When there are limited openings available near the family’s home, Child Care Solutions can also refer them to childcare programs near their place of employment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are about 1,200 childcare openings throughout Onondaga County. Residents, especially “essential” employees as defined by the state, should call the Parent Help team of Child Care Solutions at 315-446-1220, ext. 303, and they will do their best to assist them in finding child care.</span></p>

<h2>Food service expands program to include all F-M students</h2>
<p><strong>March 25</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that all students have access to healthy meals while school is closed remains a priority for the Fayetteville-Manlius School District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic vulnerability some families may be experiencing, the district is expanding its <a href="https://www.fmschools.org/f-m-will-provide-meals-to-eligible-students-during-school-closure/">grab-and-go meal program</a> during the school closure to include all F-M students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective March 26, all F-M students are eligible to receive breakfast and lunch meals each day school is closed to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand some families are facing unprecedented financial hardship right now,” F-M Superintendent Craig J. Tice said. “We want to make sure all of our students have access to healthy meals during these uncertain times.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families who wish to sign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up for F-M’s grab-and-go meal service should contact F-M’s Food Service Director at 315-692-1809 or </span><a href="mailto:catering@fmschools.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">catering@fmschools.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please indicate which school is most convenient for meal pickup and whether transportation is an issue.   </span></p>
<h3>Childcare available for essential employees</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fayetteville-Manlius Central School District is partnering with YMCA of Central New York’s Hal Welsh East Area location in Fayetteville to provide childcare for children of essential employees. The New York State Office of Children and Family Services and Child Care Solutions of CNY estimate that there are 12 openings in the pre-K program and about 119 openings for children from 5 to 13 years of age within the Fayetteville-Manlius community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the YMCA recreational facility remains closed to the public until further notice, the center’s child care program is available at no charge for employees of essential businesses, including food service and grocery store staff members, healthcare workers and first responders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any essential worker needs care, they should call Child Care Solutions at 315-446-1220.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hal Welsh East Area YMCA location in Fayetteville is open from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.  For those who are not considered essential employees, the cost is $20 per day, and scholarships are available for those in need.  Contact the YMCA at 315-637-2025 extension 0, for more information.</span></p>

<h2>District emphasizes importance of social distancing</h2>
<p><strong>March 24</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help mitigate the impact of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, Fayetteville-Manlius School District officials are asking students to continue practicing social distancing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this past weekend, the district received multiple phone calls and messages from concerned community members who stated that children were seen gathering together in various neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that students miss interacting with their friends,” F-M Superintendent Craig Tice said. “Right now, maintaining physical distance from one another can help protect our most vulnerable community members.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, social distancing is one potential mitigation strategy to reduce transmission of COVID-19, and includes avoiding large gatherings of people and maintaining a distance of six feet from others.  </span></p>
<h3>Food Service continues meal program</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">F-M Food Service offers grab-and-go breakfast and lunch meals to students who participate in the free and reduced-price meal program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible families who have not already signed up for F-M’s grab-and-go meal service should contact F-M’s Food Service Director at 315-692-1809 or <a href="mailto:catering@fmschools.org">catering@fmschools.org</a>.

<h2>Board of education meeting will be live-streamed; state assessments suspended<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
</h2>
<p><strong>March 20</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fayetteville-Manlius School District’s March 23 board of education meeting will be available for real-time viewing online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid concerns of the COVID-19 public health crisis, Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently issued an executive order exempting municipal and school boards from provisions of the state Open Meetings Law that require public access to locations where government meetings are conducted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To comply with this order, the F-M Board of Education’s March 23 meeting will be available for public viewing and participation via YouTube Live only. The meeting will stream in real-time on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCidM6tf7c3pRsKChZSfrfhg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">F-M’s official YouTube channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beginning at 6 p.m. and will be archived on the channel for later viewing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting agenda is limited to items that require immediate attention. It will include time for public comment, which viewers can participate in through YouTube Live Chat. An interactive chat window will be accessible to online audience members during this portion of the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board members and district leaders will be attending the meeting in-person and by telephone conferencing. Those in attendance will practice social distancing. </span></p>
<h3>State assessments suspended</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York State Board of Regents and state Education Department announced Friday, March 20, that the 2020 elementary- and intermediate-level state assessments have been suspended for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is most important that during the time of closure, schools are able to continue to focus their efforts toward local school and community needs, as they have been doing, and not be concerned about state assessments. NYSED has applied for federal waivers for testing, accountability and reporting requirements,” according to a statement from Board of Regents Chancellor Betty A. Rosa and Interim State Education Commissioner Shannon Tahoe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suspension applies to the following New York state testing programs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State Grades 3-8 English Language Arts Test;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State Grades 3-8 Mathematics Test;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State Grade 4 Elementary-Level Science Test;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State Grade 8 Intermediate-Level Science Test;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) in Grades K-12; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) for students with severe cognitive disabilities in Grades 3-8 and high school.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has yet to give guidance on the end-of-June Regents exams, and school officials are still awaiting news from The College Board regarding the Advanced Placement exams.</span></p>

<h2>Instructional and food service contingency plans to be launched</h2>
<p><strong>March 15</strong></p>
<p>During the county-wide emergency school closure instituted to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the Fayetteville-Manlius School District is prepared to offer online student instruction and meals for its students enrolled in its free and reduced-price meals program. </p>
<p>The district is complying with Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon’s March 14 order to close school buildings effective 4 p.m. March 20 through April 14. If there is a positive case of COVID-19 before March 20, McMahon said schools would close earlier, on March 18. </p>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution, F-M announced shortly after the county’s mandate that it would close beginning Monday, March 16. </p>
<p>The F-M Board of Education met March 15 and approved shifting the district’s planned May 19 staff development day to March 16, which will allow teachers time to prepare their online instructional activities. </p>
<p>The district will then use two of its remaining four emergency school closure days to cancel school on March 17 and March 18. If the county does not close schools earlier than planned, the district will use its remaining two emergency closure days on March 19 and March 20. This would effectively cancel F-M’s classes a week earlier than the county mandated.</p>
<p>“There are no easy answers in this situation,” Superintendent Craig J. Tice said. “Our actions are guided by what is best for our community. While there are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Onondaga County or our school district, we need to be proactive rather than reactive to this unprecedented situation that could have an impact on the health of the F-M community.” </p>
<p>As per past practice, the district will not provide online instruction or food service operations during the staff development day or the emergency closure days. Online instruction and food service programs are planned to begin March 23.</p>
<p>However, if the county closes schools at the end of the day on March 18 due to a positive case of COVID-19 in the county, the district is prepared to begin those programs March 19. </p>
<p>The district’s food service team will be providing breakfast and lunch for its students enrolled in the free and reduced-price meals program. Those families will be contacted directly on how meals will be provided. </p>
<h3>Personal items and medications</h3>
<p>Building principals will soon communicate with their respective families to make arrangements for those who need to pick up belongings, such as musical instruments, technology or clothing.</p>
<p>If families have medications at school they would like to retrieve, they should contact their school’s nurse’s office on Monday, March 16, to make arrangements for pick-up that day between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. </p>
<h3>School activities and trips</h3>
<p>The district has canceled all after-school and evening activities through April 14, when school is planned to resume. In addition, all overnight trips are canceled, including F-M High School’s music trip to Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida, the <span>crew team’s participation in the Annual Saratoga Invitational  in Saratoga Springs </span>and the grade 8 trips to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Boston, Massachusetts.  </p>
<p>Building administrators are investigating whether refunds for deposits will be honored, and they will be in contact with families regarding the cancellation of these overnight trips.</p>
<p>All local area field trips may still be held at a future date, depending upon the circumstances.  </p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>The start of the spring athletic season will be delayed until at least April 14.</p>
<h3>Continued communications</h3>
<p>In this rapidly developing situation, the district will continue to update the community via the district website with any new information and frequently asked questions.  </p>
<p>Any time-sensitive, critical information will be shared via the district’s SchoolMessenger notification system, which sends email, text message and phone call notifications, depending upon how parents subscribed to the system.</p>
<h3>Precautionary measures</h3>
<p>There are a number of steps that community members can take to minimize the spread of all respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, according to the New York State Department of Health:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Heavily soiled hands should be washed.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or a family member begin showing symptoms of a respiratory disease and suspect it may be COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider. Before going to your healthcare provider’s office, inform them that a case of COVID-19 is suspected, and follow their advice.</p>

<h2>All F-M schools closed effective Monday, March 16</h2>
<p><strong>March 14</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of an abundance of caution and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the Fayetteville-Manlius School District community, all F-M schools will be closed and all extracurricular activities and events canceled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>beginning Monday, March 16, through at least April 14</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not a decision taken lightly, as we recognize this action will impact many families’ regular routines, including child care and parents’ and guardians’ work schedules,” Superintendent Craig J. Tice said. “We appreciate your patience and flexibility during this unprecedented time. Our priority is the health and safety of our students, staff and community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 14, Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon declared a state of emergency for the county. At that time, McMahon announced that all Onondaga County schools will be closed effective March 23. In the interest of students’ health and safety, Tice and the F-M Board of Education are closing all F-M schools earlier than the county’s suggested timeframe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are no easy answers in this situation,” Tice said. “Our actions are guided by what is best for our community. While there are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Onondaga County or our school district, we need to be proactive rather than reactive to this unprecedented situation that could have an impact on the health of the F-M community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there are practical limits to trying to continue the district’s recognized instructional program in an online format, that is not the district’s goal. Instead, the district’s focus will be to ensure the “continuity of instruction” for parent-guided and self-guided learning for students or they may leverage the district’s online learning management tool, Schoology, for more frequent “office hours” interactions and constructive feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those families whose children receive school meals through the free and reduced-price meals program will be contacted directly regarding the continuity of that program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York State Education Department continues to work with the governor’s office, the New York State Department of Health and the U.S. Department of Education to provide guidance to schools and district officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this rapidly developing situation, the district will continue to update the community via the district website with any new information and frequently asked questions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any time-sensitive, critical information will be shared via the district’s SchoolMessenger notification system, which sends email, text message and phone call notifications, depending upon how parents subscribed to the system.</span></p>

Although there are no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 at F-M, district officials felt it is imperative to follow the state’s lead in canceling events that would involve a great number of people in close proximity with the goal of reducing the number of people on school campuses and in district buildings. </p>
<p>Regular school instruction is still taking place, and social distancing practices are being emphasized and encouraged. </p>
<p>District administrators are continuing to monitor all guidance from local, state and federal agencies regarding the respiratory illness caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, COVID-19.

<p>The district’s administrative team is developing response plans to continue instruction and other critical administrative and student services.</p>
<p><span>The district will continue cleaning and disinfecting its schools to minimize the spread of viruses and a variety of other illnesses.

<p>While the Fayetteville-Manlius School District does not have a confirmed case of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in our schools, district officials are aware of concerns in the community about the spread of this relatively new virus. </p>
<p>The district is closely monitoring this situation and following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), the Onondaga County Department of Health and the New York State Education Department.</p>
<p>Based on recent reports, COVID-19 is not actively circulating in Onondaga County at this time. </p>
<p>If the district becomes aware that an F-M student or staff member is diagnosed with COVID-19, it will immediately notify staff and parents/guardians. If a student or staff member shows respiratory symptoms, the district will follow its current practices for handling respiratory illnesses, subject to any additional guidance forthcoming.</p>

<header class="entry-header" aria-label="post title"><h2>Health officials urge public to take precautions against the spread of viruses</h2>
<p><strong>Feb. 10, 2020</strong></p>
</header><div class="entry-content">
<p>Health officials, elected leaders and school officials are urging the public to take precautions against the spread of seasonal influenza, or flu, and a new virus that has recently been detected in humans—2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov). </p>
<p>Confirmed influenza cases were first reported to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) in October and have been steadily on the rise since. Health officials also are monitoring the spread of 2019-nCov, which originated in China and has spread to a number of countries, including the United States. </p>
<p>“While we do not have a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the state, we are continuing to take every necessary precaution to protect New Yorkers from this dangerous virus,” New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Feb. 7. “I also want to remind New Yorkers they are more likely to be exposed to the influenza virus than the coronavirus and urge everyone to take common sense precautions to protect against both, such as regular hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.”</p>
<p>The coronavirus, which can lead to fever, cough and trouble breathing or shortness of breath, has not been found in humans before, according to a joint release from the NYSDOH and the state Education Department (SED). Health officials believe the coronavirus probably spreads from animals to humans and from person-to-person, but it’s not yet clear how easily it spreads from person-to-person. </p>
<p>The coronavirus is not actively circulating among New Yorkers at this time, according to the NYSDOH and SED release. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the coronavirus to be a serious public health concern and is studying it to better understand how it spreads and causes illness. There currently is not a vaccine for the virus. </p>
<h3>Precautionary measures</h3>
<p>The New York State Department of Health (DOH) recommends the following ways to minimize the spread of all respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash.</li>
<li>Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
