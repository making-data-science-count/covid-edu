<p><a id="April27" name="April27">April 27, 2020</a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Families--</p> <p>Today was a a great start to teaching/learning online for Collegiate Charter School of Lowell! Thank you for your many efforts as we all navigate these new waters.</p> <p><strong>Tips for Families During Online Learning</strong></p> <ol>
<li class="first">
<strong>Keep a routine:</strong> Establish a daily schedule that includes academic time, meal time, chores, playtime and outdoor time to keep children motivated, mentally engaged, and happy.</li> <li>
<strong>Create a study space:</strong> Set up a quiet, well-lit space in your home where your child can concentrate on online learning and completing assignments.</li> <li>
<strong>Nurture relationships:</strong> Although we all need to practice social distancing, that doesn’t mean we should become socially distant in our relationships. Encourage your child to check in with friends and family, helping them interact through phone calls and video chats. Interacting with others develops strong language skills, creativity, social intelligence, and confidence.</li> <li class="last">
<strong>Be patient and be kind, especially to yourself:</strong> We are all experiencing isolation, but everyone is dealing with their own issues as well, so be kind and empathic to others. Don’t forget to take care of yourself by practicing self-care. You’ll set a great example for your child on how they should treat others and themselves. (Scholastic Learning, April 2020)</li> </ol>

<p><a id="April26" name="April26">April 26, 2020</a></p> <p>Greetings Collegiate Families--</p> <p>Tomorrow begins our first day of learning "live"--teachers are very excited and I am sure that our students are as well.  With that in mind, and to ensure good learning every day, I have high expectations for student learning and positive academic behavior.  <strong>The expectations are simple: 1) Respect one's self, 2) Respect each other and 3) Respect the learning environment. </strong> Thank you ahead of time for working in partnership with us.</p> <p><strong>How can students be prepared for online learning?</strong>  Students should get a good night's sleep, eat a healthy breakfast and be ready to learn with a notebook and a pen/pencil.  As always, a positive mindset for learning helps too😊.</p> <p><strong>Important Update:</strong> If you are waiting on a Chromebook, we are in high hopes to begin distributing by the end of this week.  We will be calling/emailing you soon.  In the meantime, all packets may be found on the <bdi>SABIS</bdi>(R) Digital Platform.</p> <p><strong>The third phase of Commissioner Reilly's guidance for Remote Learning</strong> was released on Friday evening.  We will be sharing MA DESE's expectations for this final phase in the weeks to come.  This will include: 1) academic experiences that include projects, 2) Social Emotional Learning connections with our students and more....</p> <p><strong>Mr. Shehemi , Director of Academics, has shared some good resources for student engagement/enrichment:</strong></p> <ul>
<li class="first">StoryLine Online: Hear quality children's literature read aloud and see illustrations. <a href="https://www.storylineonline.net/">https://www.storylineonline.net/</a>
</li> <li class="last">PhET Online Simulations: A library of online simulations that students can play with and explore to investigate scientific and mathematical models. Can be sorted by grade level. <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">https://phet.colorado.edu/</a>

<p><a name="March30"><strong>March 30, 2020</strong></a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Families:</p> <p>I am hoping that this update from me finds you all well...and safe.  I imagine that this rainy day had many of you inside watching tv, playing games or just sleeping a little extra.  The days seem long when the sun is not shining, that is for sure.</p> <p>Today, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education sent letters to school districts across the state and asked that we share this letter with our families. The letter provides updates on a number of matters related to schools being closed across the state. Here are the letters in both <a href="https://lowell.sabis.net/downloads/public/News_and_Events/201920/dese-english-letter-to-families_covid19-3-30-20.pdf" target="_blank">English </a>and <a href="http://lowell.sabis.net/downloads/public/News_and_Events/201920/dese-spanish-letter-to-families_covid19-3-30-20.pdf" target="_blank">Spanish</a>.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: We will be uploading Week#3 work on the <bdi>SABIS</bdi>(R) Digital Platform beginning tomorrow and throughout the week. PLEASE NOTE: We are actively working with <bdi>SABIS</bdi>(R) to figure out how our students can interact digitally with his/her teachers in the coming weeks.  Our hope is to provide office hours for students with their teachers.  Please be looking for more information in the next week or so.</strong></p> <p>Many of you have emailed me asking for my advice on how to best engage with your student(s) around his/her learning. This is what I shared with my brother who is a father of 3:</p> <p><em><strong>Advice from Dr. Laurie for our Collegiate parents: "</strong></em>You might be inclined to create a minute by minute schedule for your kids. You have high hopes of hours of learning, including online activities, science experiments, and book reports. You’ll limit technology until everything is done! But here’s the thing...</p> <p>Our kids are just as scared as we are right now. Our kids not only can hear everything that is going on around them, but they feel our constant tension and anxiety. They have never experienced anything like this before. Although the idea of being off from school until May sounds awesome, they are probably picturing a fun time like summer break, not the reality of being trapped at home and not seeing their friends.</p> <p>Over the coming weeks, you will see an increase in behavior issues with your kids. Whether it’s anxiety, or anger, or protest that they can’t do things normally - it will happen. You’ll see more meltdowns, tantrums, and oppositional behavior in the coming weeks. This is normal and expected under these circumstances.</p> <p>What kids need right now is to feel comforted and loved. To feel like it’s all going to be ok. And that might mean that you tear up your perfect schedule and love on your kids a bit more. Play outside and go on walks. Bake cookies and paint pictures. Play board games and watch movies. Do a science experiment together or find virtual field trips of the zoo. Start a book and read together as a family. Snuggle under warm blankets and do nothing.</p> <p>Don’t worry about them regressing in school. Every single kid is in this boat and they all will be ok. When we are back in the classroom, we will all course correct and meet them where they are<strong>. Our Collegiate teachers are experts at this!</strong> Don’t pick fights with your kids because they don’t want to do math. Don’t scream at your kids for not following the schedule. Don’t mandate 2 hours of learning time if they are resisting it.</p> <p>If I can leave you with one thing, it’s this: at the end of all of this, your/our kids’ mental health will be more important than their academic skills. And how they felt during this time will stay with them long after the memory of what they did during those many weeks is long gone. So keep that in mind, every single day."</p> <p>I acknowledge that it is not easy to be all of you right now, but as Collegiate educators, we are there with you in spirit.</p> <p>As always, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns. </p> <p>YOU Matter--<br> Dr. Hodgdon</p> <hr>

<p><a id="March20" name="March20"><strong>March 20, 2020</strong></a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Parents and Guardians,</p> <p>When you hear, read, or watch news about an outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 you may feel anxious and show signs of stress—even when the outbreak affects people far from where you live and you are at low or no risk of getting sick. These signs of stress are normal, and may be more likely or pronounced in people with loved ones in parts of the world affected by the outbreak. In the wake of an infectious disease outbreak, monitor your own physical and mental health. Know the signs of stress in yourself and your loved ones. Know how to relieve stress, and know when to get help.</p> <p>Please read the “coping with stress during an infectious disease outbreak” handout for information on ways to recognize and alleviate stress:</p> <p><a href="https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fstore.samhsa.gov%2fsystem%2ffiles%2fsma14-4885.pdf&amp;c=E,1,KfGxb6gvpVkwM-VWvG4IlXWqslG30cdHVFKdB0hHWTPaXSd0629_eIfw5FLEZ3NMJH0MEo5Dv7ZDqnwbMdG_UHm0QzdB2kd51y0VCXBmQLFIzIinPQf8Uow8KQ,,&amp;typo=1">https://store.samhsa.gov/system/files/sma14-4885.pdf</a></p> <p>It is also very important to remember that children look to adults for guidance on how to react to stressful events. If parents seem overly worried, children’s anxiety may rise. Parents should reassure children that health and school officials are working hard to ensure that people throughout the country stay healthy. However, children also need factual, age appropriate information about the potential seriousness of disease risk and concrete instruction about how to avoid infections and spread of disease. Teaching children positive preventive measures, talking with them about their fears, and giving them a sense of some control over their risk of infection can help reduce anxiety.</p> <p>For more specific guidelines please visit the parent resource provided by the National Association of School Psychologists: </p> <p><a href="https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASN/3870c72d-fff9-4ed7-833f-215de278d256/UploadedImages/PDFs/02292020_NASP_NASN_COVID-19_parent_handout.pdf" target="_blank">https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASN/3870c72d-fff9-4ed7-833f-215de278d256/UploadedImages/PDFs/02292020_NASP_NASN_COVID-19_parent_handout.pdf</a></p> <p>Thank you,<br> Mr. Minichiello</p> <hr>

<p><a id="March16" name="March16"><strong>March 16, 2020​</strong></a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Families--</p> <p>During this time, we hope that all are healthy and are practicing social distancing. As Commissioner Reilly shared <strong>“it is critical that students and their families, as well as school staff, stay home as much as possible. If you leave your home, it is essential to strictly follow social distancing guidelines by avoiding crowds, canceling social gatherings, and maintaining a safe separation of at least 6 feet from others. Restricting access to school buildings will have little impact on public health if these best practices are not followed in good faith.”</strong></p> <p>We want our kids to take this seriously, not going over to friends’ houses, or gathering for play dates. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone. We also strongly encourage you to maintain your students’ school schedule as much as possible.</p> <p>We will continue to keep you updated as we learn more.</p> <p>Stay safe—<br> Dr. Hodgdon</p> <hr>
<p><a id="March15" name="March15"><strong>March 15, 2020</strong></a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Families--</p> <p>Per Governor Baker, Collegiate Charter School of Lowell will be closed until Tuesday, April 7<sup>th.</sup>...

<p><a id="March13" name="March13"><strong>March 13, 2020</strong></a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Families—</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has communicated that the best way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 is to limit group gatherings and minimize direct contact. <strong>Therefore, after consultation with Town and State officials, we have decided that Collegiate Charter School of Lowell will be closed beginning Monday, March 16<sup>th </sup> through Friday, March 27th, with a planned return to school on Monday, March 30<sup>th.</sup>...</strong> All extracurricular activities, including spring sports, will not take place during the school closure.<br><br><em>Why close school now?</em><br> Closing schools for 16 days limits the possible exposure for students and staff for a time period in excess of the 14-day recommended quarantine period. Our priority is the health and safety of our community. Thus, closing the school for this extended period reduces the risk of transmission to students, staff and families, especially those who may be high risk. To maximize the effectiveness of the school closure, students should minimize group gatherings.</p> <p>In closing our school, we are taking a proactive measure. Currently, there are still no confirmed cases in Lowell, according to the Lowell Health Department. However, almost half of the state’s COVID-19 cases reside in Middlesex County, according to the latest data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</p> <p><em>When will students return to school?</em><br> Our plan is to have students and staff return to Collegiate on Monday March 30<sup>th.</sup>... Given the evolving nature of this pandemic, it may be necessary to extend the current closure. If any extension is necessary, we will communicate proactively with you.</p> <p>A special thank you to the caring, thoughtful adults who have guided students through the last several days. Their professionalism and commitment to our students’ well-being are inspiring.<br><br> In closing, I appreciate that families, staff and children may be feeling unsettled and anxious at this time. I anticipate that there are additional questions and concerns. I want to assure you that we are working as quickly as possible to anticipate, respond to and address the impacts of an extended school closure. Please feel free to contact my office with feedback or questions, and I am sure you will understand that it may take us longer than usual to respond.</p> <p>YOU Matter—<br> Dr. Hodgdon</p> <hr>
<p><a id="March12" name="March12"><strong>March 12, 2020</strong></a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Families—</p> <p>In an effort to keep our learning community safe, we will be postponing/canceling the following activities at Collegiate <strong>until after March 31st</strong>:</p> <ul>
<li class="first">ALL CLUBS and SLO activities after school—Dance, STEM etc.</li> <li>Girl Scouts weekly meetings</li> <li>Ty Jackson’s Literacy Presentation on March 16th</li> <li>Grade 9 Field Trip to the North Shore Music Theatre on March 19th</li> <li>The Parent Connection Ice Cream Social on March 20th</li> <li>Spring Athletics meeting on March 23rd</li> <li>Restorative Justice Day on March 26th</li> <li>Paint and Pizza Night on March 26th</li> <li class="last">First Track Practice on March 30th</li> </ul>
<p>IMPORTANT: We will continue with after school homework help, ELL tutoring and our before and after school programs.  We will be limiting meetings before, after and during the school day however.</p> <p>Our goal is to keep our students safe.  We appreciate your patience during this time.</p> <p>Better Together—<br> Dr. Hodgdon</p> <hr>
<p><a id="March11" name="March11"><strong>March 11, 2020</strong></a></p> <p>Dear Collegiate Families—</p> <p>Collegiate Charter School of Lowell wants to assure you that we are receiving the latest information from DPH and CDC and will monitor this situation very closely. At this time, our focus is on prevention education (just like the regular flu season) and symptom surveillance. Your School Nurses are trained and prepared for this situation. We will continue to work with these agencies and the local boards of health in order to provide you with updates as they become available. It is important to note that Massachusetts residents are much more likely to become sick with a cold or the flu than to be exposed to COVID-19. Many of the precautions that help prevent colds and the flu can help protect against other respiratory viruses such as COVID-19. To assist us in keeping students healthy, we ask your help and cooperation in following the simple and effective preventative measures below.  </p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: If your child is not feeling well or, has an elevated temperature in the morning, please do not give a medication, such as a fever reducer, and send him/her to school. Keep the child home and monitor the symptoms. If you are unsure of what to do, please call your child’s health care provider.  If your student has flu-like symptoms at school, he/she will be dismissed by the school nurse.</strong></p> <p><strong>Here are some of the important things Collegiate is doing as a school to help prevent the spread of flu and other viruses here at school:</strong></p> <ul>
<li class="first">School staff will also stay home when sick with flu symptoms, cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze, and wash their hands often. </li> <li>The schools are cleaned regularly, per CDC recommendations, especially where germs are most likely to be located. This includes more frequent cleaning during peak periods of the flu. </li> <li>Hand sanitizer is available throughout the school. Remind your child to take advantage of this. </li> <li>School nurses will work closely with local and state public health authorities and continue to provide illness surveillance.</li> <li class="last">School and public health officials will be focused on preventing the spread of flu in school so that the schools can stay open. They will closely follow the situation and will inform you in the unlikely event that your child’s school is closed.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Here are some additional things you can do to help stop the spread of germs and protect yourself and your family from the flu:</strong></p> <ul>
<li class="first">Get vaccinated! It is not too late to get your child the influenza vaccine. Vaccination is still the best way to keep you and your child from getting the flu.</li> <li>Wash hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds. </li> <li>Cover coughs and sneezes with tissues or by coughing into inside of elbow, not hands. </li> <li>Instruct your child to stay at least three feet away from people who are sick. </li> <li class="last">Use hand sanitizer when soap and water not available. Gels, rubs, and hand wipes all work well, as long as they contain at least 60% alcohol.</li> </ul>
<p>Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns. </p> <p>YOU ALL matter--<br> Dr. Hodgdon</p> <hr>
