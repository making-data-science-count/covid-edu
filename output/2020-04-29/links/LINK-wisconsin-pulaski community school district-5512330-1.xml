            <p>Dear Pulaski parents, students and staff:</p>

<p>I wanted to give an update on a few items that I know people are discussing:</p>

<p>Because of orders from the state of Wisconsin, we are not allowed to host activities on school grounds until June 30. And, even then, it may be longer if a new order is given. This means no group meetings or use of buildings, other than the food program and other school-directed activity related to virtual teaching or business operations.</p>

<p>We do plan on having summer school in some type of form. We are just in the beginning stage of figuring out what this may look like virtually, at least until July. More information will be sent later.</p>

<p>We discussed graduation and possible celebration activities for our seniors at the last PCSD Board of Education meeting. Graduation, as we have done in the past, is prohibited at this point.  All school districts across the state are struggling with providing this important event.  Again, we are working on different scenarios and need time to plan an appropriate event for everyone. Please be patient.</p>

<p>We are pleased the Hobart Village Board has joined us on working on a safer crossing in front of Hillcrest Elementary School. This work will take place this summer and will be completed by the time school begins in fall. The district appreciates the Hobart Village Board’s contributions and leadership in making this long-awaited upgrade happen!</p>

<p>I wish I had the magic wand to make everything to go back to normal. However, every day is getting warmer, we hope the worse is over and someday our schools will be full of smiling students. Hang in there.</p>

            <p>Dear PCSD Parents and Families:</p>

<p>Based on the announcement from the Governor last week, we now know that K-12 schools will remain closed for the rest of this academic year.  We understand that this update is not only a disappointment to your children and families, but in many cases feels like a devastating loss for all.  We had all hoped for the opportunity to reconnect with our students in our schools to bring closure to the year.  We really appreciate all your efforts and support with virtual learning during this time while balancing other daily priorities.  We wanted to provide a few updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Virtual Learning Activities: 
	<ul>
<li>K-5: Teachers will continue to share a 10-Day Learning Plan in Seesaw every two weeks. </li>
		<li>6-12: Teachers will continue to post items regarding daily work via Canvas Modules.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Grading of students during COVID-19: 
	<ul>
<li>Elementary and 6th grade feedback and progress will continue to be shared with students, parents/guardians through utilizing our PCSD standards-based report card during the virtual learning timeframe.  </li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>For the report card at the end of the semester, you will notice more of an emphasis on comments for providing feedback about student progress.   </li>
	<li>There also will be more potential for * indicating that standards were not accessed at this time in the virtual learning environment.
	<ul>
<li>Grades 7-12: Specific information was shared on April 16, 2020 regarding the Pass/No Pass grading for virtual learning.  </li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Instructional Technology Updates:
	<ul>
<li>Google Meet recently updated (as of 4/21/20) so students can no longer be in Office Hours Google Meets if the teacher is not in the Meet.  </li>
		<li>Feeling stressed at home?  Below are some apps that focus specifically on coping via <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/lists/meditation-apps-for-kids" target="_blank">meditation</a>, connection, and other techniques.  These apps are available in Self Service for any student to download: <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/three-good-things-a-happiness-journal" target="_blank">3 Good Things: A Happiness Journal</a>, and <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/stop-breathe-think" target="_blank">Stop Breathe and Think</a>
</li>
		<li>Thanks for taking care of your district iPads! We’ve had few repairs for the number of devices being used at home!  For any assistance with iPads and/or general Tech Support, please see our <a href="https://www.pulaskischools.org/updates/ipad-tech-support" target="_blank">parent tech portal page</a>.</li>

            <p>April 16, 2020</p>

<p>Dear PCSD Students and Families:</p>

<p>We are sharing with you decisions that have been made regarding grading and report cards in the virtual learning setting as a result of the COVID-19 closures.  Recently, 6-12 building leadership and counselors met and after much research from other Wisconsin school districts, consultation with an attorney through CESA 7, research of educational grading gurus recommendations and communications with colleges, we have established practices for our Semester 2 grading in the virtual learning environment. Please see the appendix of resources we utilized in making our decision located in the attachment at the bottom of the page.   </p>

<p>Equity for all students surfaced on all fronts when doing our research about grading in the COVID-19 situation.  Protecting the academic progress and achievement of all students who are negatively impacted by access and opportunity gaps exacerbated by virtual learning required a shift in our grading practices. The most vulnerable students in our school setting will remain the most vulnerable students in virtual learning settings plus we will have additional students, families, and staff in crisis with COVID-19. Our grading practices will focus on the continuation of learning and provide feedback to students and families. Grading will be based on the principle of “no educational harm to any child.” </p>

<p>The following grading practices and procedures will be implemented for Semester 2:</p>

<p>Elementary and 6th grade grading/feedback will continue through utilizing the standards-based report card during the virtual learning timeframe.  An end of a year progress report will be completed for each student.  </p>

<p>3rd quarter report cards and grades are suspended for all courses 6-12.  Staff will provide end of year feedback for all students.  Feedback for courses that rotate at the end of the quarter or mid-quarter will also be provided with the June report card.  </p>

<p>All late work for Quarter 3 and 4 will be accepted for the whole term and points will not be deducted for late work. All students will have the opportunity to redo, makeup, or try again to complete, show progress, or attempt to complete work assigned prior to and during virtual learning.</p>

<p>In grades 7-12, we will transition to Pass and No Pass with a notation of *COVID-19 Disruption noted on our report cards and transcripts for Semester 2</p>

<p>Criteria for Pass:  Student has met or exceeded minimum proficiency levels for identified power standards and essential learning targets.  If using percentage scores, a grade of 50% or higher is passing.</p>

<p>Criteria for No Pass:  Student has not met minimum proficiency levels for identified power standards and essential learning targets.  Every effort has been made to ensure that students have received feedback and the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency of the standards over the course of the virtual learning period.  Teachers must ensure parents, counselors and administration have been notified by May 15 regarding the no pass and how to remedy it. If a student receives a no pass, the teacher must document a clearly delineated plan for the student to resolve the no pass based on credit recovery of the power standards and essential learning targets.  </p>

<p>We will do everything in our power to ensure our students pass through remediation, reteaching, redo of assignments, reassessment, etc.</p>

<p>For high school specifically:</p>

<p>Pass/No Pass includes dual credit (advanced standing and transcribed), NWTC/FVTC, Advanced Placement, and Project Lead The Way.  However, these courses, due to college requirements (NWTC, FVTC, SNC, UWGB, UWO, etc.), may still need to be issued a grade for their records.  Students will still be required to meet the sponsoring institution’s requirements to earn the dual credit at that institution/program. However, for PHS purposes, these courses will not impact a student’s GPA.</p>

<p>Pass/no pass grade will freeze GPA as it stands after the first semester at PHS. The second-semester pass/no pass grade will not impact GPA.</p>

<p>Students will not receive the .025 increase for indexed courses in the GPA computation for semester 2</p>

<p>School profiles that are shared with colleges during the application process will reflect the *COVID-19 Disruption information</p>

<p>We hope that we have provided you with information to help with how grading will be handled during the COVID-19 disruption. Please continue to help your children take ownership of their learning during our current educational situation.  We know this is an issue very near and dear to many of you, and we appreciate your patience as we developed a guideline to respond to your concerns.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact one of us for further discussion.  </p>

            <p>Good morning!</p>

<p>A few notes from PCSD Food Services on updates to our curbside meal service at our open buildings.</p>

<p>Update on meal service logistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Curbside meal service will continue to be offered at Hillcrest, Glenbrook and Sunnyside Elementary Schools Monday-Friday 11 a.m. -2 p.m. while school is closed.</li>
	<li>For the safety of our team members as well as your safety, moving forward, we will no longer be reaching into any vehicles to place meals nor will we hand meals directly to anyone whether they are walking, biking or driving up.  We will have tables set up and will place meals on the table for you to pick up once our crew member has backed away from the staging table.  </li>
	<li>If you are unable to get out of your vehicle, please communicate that with our crew members and we will make safe accommodations for you and our crew at the curb.  </li>
	<li>Please continue to keep in mind social distancing.</li>
	<li>Beginning today, we will also be requiring our crew that is working during this time at the curb to wear a mask for their safety and for yours.  Please do not be alarmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update on meal service dates:</p>

<p>Meal service dates for the week of April 6: Due to it being Good Friday, we will not be open for meal service on Friday, April 10.  We will serve meals Monday through Thursday this week and will supply Friday’s meals along with those served on Thursday.  We will be back open beginning Monday, April 13.</p>

<p>We appreciate your continued patience with these changes as we work to improve safety for our community and our team members.  Look forward to seeing you all curbside!</p>

            <p>A message from PCSD Food Services</p>

<p>With the recent school closures, PCSD Food Services wants to do everything it can to serve our community and help our students during this time even while they cannot be in the buildings.  PCSD is offering curbside meal service to anyone 18 and under at the below buildings, dates and times.  </p>

<p>All meals that are served are FREE to students 18 and under, no paperwork required, no questions asked. Meals will be served regardless of eligibility. A child does not need to attend the building from which he or she is picking up meals. Families will not need to enter the building as drive-through meal service will be offered. Due to closures, we ask that the meal not be consumed in the school area.  Meals will be available for pick-up outside, at the door indicated below.</p>

<p>Two meals will be served at one time, lunch for the current day and breakfast for the following day.</p>

            <p>District parents and staff,</p>

<p>News of the coronavirus COVID-19 is everywhere. Many parents are wondering how to bring up the epidemic in a way that will be reassuring and not make kids more worried than they already may be. With the quick closure of schools, here is some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsx-M03mnwzUXd7u3s9bdiOurirTQNZHhR3qJPc5xSg/edit?ts=5e6fa5a2" target="_blank">advice</a> from the experts at the Child Mind Institute.</p>

<p>Other items of note include:</p>

<p>PCSD Food Service is working on plans to provide student meals for this week starting Wednesday. A separate announcement on this will be sent to parents on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Students have no online study obligations until the first Monday following the regularly scheduled spring break, March 30. More information will be pushed out to parents prior to March 30.</p>

<p>In regard to spring sports, the WIAA has banned all activities until April 6. Check out more from the WIAA <a href="https://www.wiaawi.org/News/News-Article/ArtMID/5378/ArticleID/21334/Governor%e2%80%99s-Executive-Order-Suspends-Spring-Sports-Seasons" target="_blank">here</a>. Once school is back in session, FRCC athletic directors will meet to plan spring sports seasons.</p>

<p>The PCSD will provide additional information to parents and staff regarding the coronavirus or Covid-19 and its impact on the PCSD as soon as possible. Please watch your email on a regular basis for new correspondence.

            <p>According to DPI expectations for school closures, all medications must be picked up by parents before the school closure Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Parents must pick up medication today or tomorrow by 3:30 p.m. A responsible adult other than the parent may pick up medication if the parent cannot come during the time frame, as a parent you are able to designate an alternate adult to pick up the medication but you will need to contact the school's office to give the name of that adult. For controlled substances, the district will be check an ID and count the number of pills you are given back. </p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Parents,</p>

<p>Even though Gov. Evers closed all state schools, we will continue with the plan sent out yesterday.  As of now, students will not report to school on March 18 and would report back to school on April 14.  We want to make sure students stay out of school for at least two weeks after many families return from other states or countries after our scheduled spring break.</p>

<p>If a member of your family has recently visited states on the West Coast, New York or any other hard-hit state or country, please keep your child home on Monday or Tuesday to decrease the chance of spreading this virus.</p>

<p>If the child needs supplies from school for the break, call the school.  They will make arrangements to get those you by meeting you at the car or entering school on the days that students will not be in school this week.</p>

<p>I am sure there will be a number of messages as we move forward with this once-in-a-lifetime event.   We will keep parents informed as best we can.</p>

<p>Here is hoping your family stays healthy and refer to our <a href="https://www.pulaskischools.org/updates/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the district’s website for the most up-to-date information.</p>

            <p>Dear PCSD families:</p>

<p>I am writing to share an update regarding some information pertaining to Covid19 and the PCSD plan.  After discussions with the Department of Health as well as area superintendents, we have decided to have school for students on Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17.  However as of Wednesday, March 18 students will not be in attendance until April 14, 2020. Future communications will be coming regarding a meal program for students as well as potential childcare. Our staff will have professional development and collaboration time on March 18-20 to work on virtual learning for our students following our spring break.  More information will be shared with parents later next week regarding virtual learning. </p>

<p>Staff will continue to work to support the needs of students. School counselors will be available to support students as changes take place.</p>

<p>Students have been asked to bring the following items home this weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elementary:  Winter boots and snow pants (due to custodial staff doing a deep clean in our buildings), iPads along with cords and cubes and Stepping Stones Math Journals.</li>
	<li>Middle and High School:  iPads, cords and cubes. </li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of devices, please discuss the following iPad care with your children:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be mindful of how you place your iPad in your backpack.  If there is any padding in student backpacks, please store iPads within this padding.  If there is not any padding in backpacks, please ensure there is not alot of weight on top of the iPads as the backpacks are carried.</li>
	<li>Be mindful of how you set down your backpack with the iPad in it.  Please don’t throw or drop your backpacks.</li>
	<li>At home, please don’t put iPads on floors that they can be stepped on.</li>
	<li>Leave your iPad, cable and cube in a central location at home to avoid misplacing it.</li>
	<li>Please keep iPads away from all food and drink.</li>
	<li>Bring the iPad back to school on Monday charged with charging cable and cube.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this time, we understand that parents may have concerns about sending your child(ren) to school. Parents who do not feel comfortable sending their child(ren) to school may opt to keep their child at home without penalty of truancy.</p>

<p>We are currently working through our plan of action for after spring break. Please refer to our <a href="https://www.pulaskischools.org/updates/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">FAQ</a> posted on the district website.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Coronavirus continues to evolve daily throughout the United States.  We, in the Pulaski Community School District, are continuing to work on our efforts to ensure the safety of the students, staff and everyone who is part of our district. Click <a href="https://www.pulaskischools.org/updates/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">HERE</a> to access an FAQ link, which will also be displayed on the homepage of the PCSD website to help answer some of the inquiries we are getting on a daily basis. Our main purpose for this message is to let everyone know we are using the most up-to-date information provided to us from a variety of sources including the health departments.  </p>

<p>We will continue to update our community through this spring until the virus subsides. As good role models for our students, as we deal with this situation, we want to stay calm, follow instructions from health professionals and use common sense moving forward.  Panic, anger or over-reaction will not help at this time, and will cause more stress for our children.  </p>

<p>We are asking parents to update emergency contact information in Skyward Family Access or by calling your child’s school. To update your phone numbers and email in Skyward, log into Skyward Family Access and select “My Account” in the upper right menu bar.  We would like to ensure that we are giving families the most up-to-date communication.  </p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns, please call or email Dana Thibodeau, District Office administrative assistant, at 920-822-6001, dmthibodeau@pulaskischools.org, and she will forward the questions to the appropriate person.</p>

            <p>Dear Pulaski Community School District families and staff,</p>

<p>The threat of the coronavirus or COVID-19 has been on the forefront of news coverage in recent weeks. The immediate health risk from this virus to Brown, Shawano and Oconto county residents is considered very low at this time, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.</p>

<p>PCSD leadership is monitoring communications from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) regarding the coronavirus or COVID-19. Currently, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) reports that 39 people in Wisconsin have been tested for the virus. One individual tested positive for the virus, 24 tested negative and 14 cases are  pending. If you wish to stay up-to-date on the testing and the results in Wisconsin, the <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/outbreaks/index.htm" target="_blank">DHS has a website</a> that is updated every week day by 2 p.m. For the most up-to-date information, visit the <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/index.htm" target="_blank">Wisconsin Department of Health Services’ webpage</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control’s COVID-19 webpage</a>.</p>

<p> The PCSD is being proactive in its planning. District leadership has met to discuss our school district preparedness plan.  Additional meetings will occur next week to fine-tune those plans, with additional meetings planned as needed when more information becomes available. If we have a situation of significantly increased illness or if there are local cases of COVID-19, we will work closely with the Brown County Public Health Department and will follow and adhere to its directions.  </p>

<p>The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has also <a href="https://dpi.wi.gov/sspw/2019-novel-coronavirus" target="_blank">posted guidance</a> regarding preventing the spread of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19.    </p>

<p>We will keep you posted should the need for further action occur.</p>

<p>In the meantime, wash your hands, cover your coughs and if you or your children are sick, please stay home.</p>

<p>PCSD leadership</p>
