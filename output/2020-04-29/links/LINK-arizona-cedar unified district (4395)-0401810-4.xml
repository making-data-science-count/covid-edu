	<div class="newsbody">
<p class="">At this unprecedented time of a national emergency and state declared public school closures, we are making every effort to continue our educational program for our students at Cedar Unified School District. For a list of educational resources, please see our March 26 update.</p>
<div class="pom-container"><ul><li class=""><a href="https://tb2cdn.schoolwebmasters.com/accnt_332664/site_332665/Documents/March-26-2020-CUSD-Update.pdf" title="" alt="" target="_blank">March 26, 2020, Update: Educational Resources</a></li></ul></div>

<p class="">Dear Parents, Guardians, and Community Members:</p>
<p class="">The Arizona Department of Health Services, the Navajo County Public Health Services, and the Winslow Indian Health Center have made clear the need for community members to continue taking major proactive measures to limit the potential community spread of COVID-19. Accordingly, the Cedar School District calls for complete shelter-in-place, stay-at-home declaration for our school staff, and closed campus must continue indefinitely.</p>
<p class="">The continuity of operations (COOP) for K–12 educational instructional program, however, will continue as mandated by the state department of education. Our continuing school educational program continues in the form of a hybrid hard copy/digital educational resource continuity of operations. The hard-copy homework assignments are mailed out to the parent/s/guardian/s. Upon completion, these assignments need to be returned to the school through the drop-off boxes outside the school cafeteria. We identify the crates by grade level. The hours for homework return drop-off are from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m. each week on Thursdays. </p>
<p class="">Additionally, for those with access to digital resources, we are using email, smartphones, All Call, Google Hangout, ZOOM, and one-way YouTube live streaming. With parental permission, our instructional staff can also set up, provide, and manage a G Suite for Education account for your child/student. G Suite for Education is a set of education productivity tools from Google, including Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Classroom, and more used by millions of students and teachers around the world. At Cedar School District, as enjoyed by <a href="https://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/" title="" alt="" target="_blank">International Baccalaureate schools</a>, our students will be enabled to use their G Suite accounts to complete assignments, communicate with their teachers, sign into Chromebooks, and learn 21st-century digital international citizenship skills for a better world. For those with digital capability, parents/guardians are encouraged to have students access exceptional educational learning resources, as noted on the March 26, 2020, memorandum posted on the school district website. </p>
<p class="">The school foodservice, however, had to be closed for the next two weeks. We are taking this urgent action to protect our staff and our communities from the alarming COVID-19 community spread.</p>
<p class="">Apart from the COOP for instruction activity, the campus will remain closed with assistance from public safety for school campus closure monitoring and enforcement. Please check our district website for the most recent updates from the Navajo County Public Health Services, the Winslow Indian Health Center, and the Arizona Department of Health Services on this pandemic influenza spread.</p>
<p class="">We are truly appreciative of the commitment, dedication, and determination of our staff to work with our students at this distressing unprecedented time. Our school continues to await personal protective equipment ordered over four weeks ago for our district. Until these orders arrive, we cannot issue protective equipment such as disposable gloves, masks, and disinfecting wipes for our staff who have to come to school to carry out the state-mandated COOP activities in instruction, food service, and facilities decontamination.</p>
<p class="">Sincere Regards,</p>
<p class="">Dr. Begay</p>

	<div class="newstitle">Navajo County Public Health Confirms Additional Case of COVID-19 in Navajo County</div>
	<div class="newsbody"><div class="">
<p class="">Navajo County public health officials and the Arizona Department of Health Services, in partnership with Little Colorado Medical Center (LCMC), recently announced a person has been diagnosed with COVID-19. The individual was evaluated and tested within the respiratory clinic at the Little Colorado physician office in accordance with customary isolation procedures. The patient is a resident of Navajo County and is self-quarantining in accordance with CDC guidelines at their home. Any individuals who have been identified as having been exposed will be contacted directly by public health officials. If you have not been contacted by public health officials, your risk of exposure to this case is extremely limited. These individuals will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms in collaboration with Navajo County Public Health and medical providers.</p>
<p class="">“We encourage the public to stay calm, stay up-to-date with recommendations, and do their best to help slow the spread. We ask that everyone routinely <a href="http://navajocountyaz.gov/coronavirus" title="" alt="" target="_blank">check the COVID-19 dashboard</a> for the most recent information,” said Jeffrey Lee, Director of the Navajo County Public Health Department. “If you experience even mild symptoms, we ask that you please stay home. Everyone should be practicing social distancing. Those who are most at-risk for developing severe complications from COVID-19 are older adults and those with existing chronic health conditions.”</p>
<p class="">Local public health officials are currently investigating to identify any close contacts that may have been exposed. Identified individuals will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms. COVID-19 spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms are thought to appear within two to 14 days after exposure and consist of fever, cough, runny nose, and difficulty breathing. Those considered at risk for contracting the virus are individuals with travel to an area where COVID-19 is spreading or individuals in close contact with a person under investigation for the COVID-19.</p>
<p class="">The best way to prevent COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases is to:</p>
<p class=""></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li class="">Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
<li class="">Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li class="">Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li class="">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
<li class="">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. </li>
<li class="">If you have recently traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading and have developed fever with cough or shortness of breath within 14 days of your travel or have had contact with someone who is suspected to have COVID-19, stay home and call your healthcare provider. If you feel sick, stay at home. Do not go to work, and contact your healthcare provider. If your children are sick, keep them at home and contact your healthcare provider. If someone in your household has tested positive for COVID-19, keep the entire household at home. Please call your healthcare facility to get instructions before going in.</li>
</ul>
<div class="">
<p class="">Please <a href="http://navajocountyaz.gov/coronavirus" title="" alt="" target="_blank">visit our continually updated local COVID-19 dashboard</a> for the latest official information about COVID-19, <a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/" title="" alt="" target="_blank" class="">visit the Arizona Department of Health Services website</a> for the latest information on Arizona's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, and call (844) 542-8201 with questions about COVID-19.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li class="">Specifies that schools may deviate from the statutory requirements relating to special education programs and that public schools shall attempt to ensure that each student with a 504 or IEP or who receives SPED services through an IEP has access to the educational opportunities offered by the school.</li>
<li class="">Specifies that if the daily route mileage in 2019–2020 is less than it was in 2018–2019 then districts can use 2018–2019 daily route mileage for the 2020–2021 fiscal/school year.</li>
<li class="">Allows public schools to use any money generated during 2019–2020 to provide summer school instruction.</li>
