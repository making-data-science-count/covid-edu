<h3>April 16, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>We are writing to let you know that New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced during his April 16 press briefing that New York state will remain “on pause” through May 15 to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>As part of this order, New York state schools will remain closed through May 15. The governor could extend the closure again if he feels it is necessary to contain the virus.</p>
<p>As educators, we love our time with our students, and we will continue to miss them every day until we are all together again at school.</p>
<p>Communicating and connecting with students and families during this time continues to be our top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Continuity of Education/Remote Learning</strong><br>
Since the initial school closure in March, our district has been considering long term plans to continue teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Classes that have not already begun to work on new material will do that beginning Monday. Classroom teachers will continue to connect with their students and look for multiple ways to present new material.</p>
<p>We also have <a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org/home-learning-support-for-families/">instructional resources and information for students and families</a> available.</p>
<p><strong>Food for Families</strong><br>

<h3>April 8, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>As you may know, Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced that schools in New York state will remain closed through April 29. This announcement extends the closure an additional two weeks from the previously announced date of April 15.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I992hN6HQsA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
<p>In addition, the New York State Education Department (NYSED) has canceled the June 2020 Regents exams, and has announced that students will be able to earn diploma credit for courses without taking these exams. More information about the details of these requirements will be provided to affected students soon.</p>
<p>While sporting practices and events, rehearsals, shows, school events, activities and after-school programs remain canceled during this time, we will continue providing meals to families. <a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org/coronavirus-meals/">Find more information about school meals here</a>.</p>
<p>Childcare for essential workers is also being arranged. <a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org/childcare-needs-for-essential-workers/">You can find more information about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Our teachers have been in contact with students and their families to provide instructional materials, and will continue to do so throughout this extended closure in accordance with the district’s plan for continuing instruction. <a href="https://sites.google.com/sgfcsd.org/homelearning/home">Visit our home learning support website here</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning April 20, students in K-8 will begin learning new material. Teachers are working to develop lessons that reflect a prioritized, condensed curriculum.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will provide you with more information as it becomes available and continue to communicate with families via email and our website.</p>
<h3>April 1, 2020 Update</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope this communication finds you healthy. I know it’s hard to believe, but after a few long weeks, we have made it to April, together! We continue to figure out our way and work through this new routine of virtual learning. Teachers will continue to give you and our students guidance and support during this time. Information from the state level and news comes fast and furious for all and I am sure at times it is very confusing. Here are some important topics that I want to share with you.</span></p>
<p><b>School Closure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor continues to review school closures every two weeks and based on this, we continue to be closed until at least April 15. During this time, schools are required to provide continuity of learning, meals for students and childcare resources every weekday, including days originally part of the previously scheduled spring break. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please visit our website for the following information: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org/home-learning-support-for-families/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instructional resources and information for students and families</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org/coronavirus-meals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meal distribution times and locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org/childcare-needs-for-essential-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Childcare resources for families of essential workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Budget Vote and Elections Postponed</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York state school budget votes and board of education elections will be delayed until at least June 1, 2020, according to an executive order released by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday, March 30, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recognize that this is a stressful and challenging situation. We know that you are managing many personal and professional responsibilities and we will continue to support you in every way we can, sharing guidance with you along the way. I am sure many of your students are missing their friends, teachers, routines and even family vacations that may have been planned for April Break. Use this week to continue learning, but to think of learning in different ways. Use the break week to ensure that your students are rested and relaxed. We believe that mental health is a key component of overall health and we want to make sure our families are taking opportunities to focus on academics and wellness when they can. </span></p>
<p><b>Highlighted Area – Social Emotional Support</b></p>
<p><img src="https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Socal-Emotional-Support-300x83.jpg" alt="Social Emotional Support Resources" width="300" height="83" class="wp-image-41095 size-medium alignright" srcset="https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Socal-Emotional-Support-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Socal-Emotional-Support-1024x284.jpg 1024w, https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Socal-Emotional-Support-768x213.jpg 768w, https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Socal-Emotional-Support-1536x426.jpg 1536w, https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Socal-Emotional-Support.jpg 1817w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we are together in school, our teachers and staff have the opportunity to connect on a personal level every day with students. Now that we’re apart, we are hoping families can take some time to explore the Social Emotional Support section of our Home Learning Support website! </span><a href="https://sites.google.com/sgfcsd.org/homelearning/social-emotional-support?authuser=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please take a look at the social-emotional resources available on our family resource site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, please do not hesitate to contact your teachers and principals with any questions that you have. We are here for you! </span></p>

<h3>A Special Message for Our Kindergarten Families</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Kindergarten Families,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things our students do each day at school is say the Pledge of Allegiance. This simple routine builds community–something we’re all missing as we navigate our new normal without coming into school each day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, we’d like YOU to join us in our Pledge of Allegiance Flipgrid!</span></p>
<p><b>How do you participate?<br></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click the link below, watch the video from me, and click the big green button to record a response, and then save and post! Your response will be recorded! You can check out the videos from other students across the district! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that if you share your students on the Flipgrid it will be available for our entire community to see.</span></p>

<p><strong>State Testing</strong><br>

<h3>March 19, 2020 Update</h3>
<p><strong>Information from the Saratoga County Office of Public Health</strong></p>
<p>During this period of school closures, it is critical that students and their families stay home as much as possible. If you leave your home, it is essential to follow social distancing guidelines by avoiding crowds, canceling social gatherings, and maintaining a safe separation of at least 6 feet from others.</p>
<p>Keeping your distance from others will not only help reduce the spread of COVID-19 but can also help protect your family members from getting sick. We know this is a difficult time and we want to make sure students can stay connected. While we know that many students will want to spend this time with friends it is important that you do not gather together but rather find other ways to connect such as social media, face-time, etc.</p>
<p>This is a great time to clean out your closets, walk your dog, read a book, or go for a bike ride. You do not have to stay indoors. It is okay to go outside, however, regardless of the activities there should not be any large groups hanging out together. If a few students wanted to go outside and hang out together it should be with activities that still allow for social distancing. During this time social distancing is important to protect not only you but also your family, elders and others around you.</p>
<h3>March 18, 2020 Update</h3>
<p><strong>Academics Update</strong></p>
<p>Our teachers and team at school have been working diligently to create learning materials and resources that students can use to practice skills, review what they’ve learned and explore new topics while school is closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/sgfcsd.org/homelearning/home">Click here to view these resources</a>.</p>
<p>We cannot replicate everything that happens in our classrooms remotely, especially because we know that there are students who do not have access to the technology they may need. If you are unable to access these resources, please contact your child’s teacher or call 518-824-2256 for immediate assistance.</p>
<p>Please don’t hesitate to reach out to teachers by email and they will be able to respond to families directly. We understand that families are still working out their own daily schedules during this time. Teachers understand and will work with each of you to support your child’s learning at home.</p>

<p>I spent some time in the early hours this morning thinking about what could come next today and what message would I want to send… Quite honestly, my hero, Brene Brown says it best. As a district, we are creating the story that we want our students to experience and our hope is that it will lead to a brave new ending for all of us.</p>
<p>By now, most students should have heard from their teachers in some way. We continue to work them on materials to share. We also stress with them that we know all families are in various situations and we need to work with each one of you to make this a positive experience for your children.</p>
<p>A few updates are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, March 17</strong><br>
Elementary schools were open from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for students to pick up personal items or medicine from the nurse. Oliver W. Winch Middle School and the high school were open from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. If your child realizes that something is still missing, please call the building office for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Academics</strong><br>
Teachers, building principals and the district will continue to communicate with families about learning materials to use at home. Families should expect to receive more information about staying connected throughout the coming week.</p>
<p><strong>Internet and WiFi </strong><br>
Spectrum announced Friday it will offer free high-speed internet service and Wi-Fi for 60 days to households with students. Families can call (844) 488-8395 to enroll. Installation fees will be waived for new student households, the company said. Spectrum said regular pricing will take effect at the end of the 60-day period if a customer doesn’t cancel or change the service. <a href="https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-to-offer-free-access-to-spectrum-broadband-and-wifi-for-60-days-for-new-K12-and-college-student-households-and-more">Read more here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Meals</strong><br>
A member of your child’s school will contact all families that receive free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch. Meals were distributed for the first time today, Tuesday, March 17. Grab-and-go meals for two days will be available for families who qualify on Tuesday and Thursday from 12-3 p.m. at the South Glens Falls High School Cafeteria. Families can come to the rear of the building where a staff member will provide the meals. Families will not enter the building. Families can also opt for delivery if they are not able to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>Backpack Program</strong><br>
There are currently 120 students that are part of this program at the elementary level. This program will continue and deliveries will be made to each student’s house on Friday. More information will come later in the week.</p>

Office personnel will be available by phone or email on Wednesday and Thursday this week. All schools will be closed for cleaning on Friday. The district office will be open from 9-1 on Friday, March 20. We will update you on hours next week in the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>Communication With Families</strong><br>
Please realize that information above may be modified as things change. Please check our district website often for updates. As always, if you have any questions or the health of your family changes, you can contact the superintendent immediately. All information will remain confidential.</p>

<p>For general questions about COVID-19 please call the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) 24/7 Hotline at 1-888-364-3065 or visit the <a href="https://www.saratogacountyny.gov/departments/publichealth/">Saratoga County Public Health Website</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>This message was emailed to all fifth-grade parents in the district. If you are not receiving email from the district, please call the district office at 518-793-9617 to confirm your email address.</em></strong></p>
<p>Tonight, Tuesday, March 17, from 3:00-6:00 p.m., we will distribute Chromebooks to students at their home elementary school. We will be distributing all Chromebooks from the front door of the school that your child attends, and we are asking that only fifth-grade students come up to the door to retrieve the Chromebook. Parents and family members should stay in their vehicle. At that time our school staff will record the serial number of the Chromebook next to your child’s name. We expect that these will be returned to school once classes resume.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that these are school devices that will still be connected to the school district filter even when students log in from home. Students have all had the opportunity to login to and use these devices during their time in school, so they will be familiar with them.</p>
<h3>March 16, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>We know that the information has been coming fast and furiously over the past several days. We feel that as well.</p>
<p>As you know, our three priorities during this time include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The health and safety of our community.</li>
<li>Helping our community cope with the closure of the school district by addressing basic needs such as providing free and reduced-price meals to families who need it.</li>
<li>Plans to encourage student learning for the duration of the closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s where we stand in each of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Health and Safety</strong><br>
Please direct medical questions to your family doctor/healthcare provider. If you or one of your family members tests positive for COVID-19/Coronavirus, please contact the district office.</p>
<p><strong>Meals</strong><br>
Meal distribution will begin tomorrow. Grab-and-go meals for two days will be available for families who qualify on Tuesday and Thursday from 12 to 3 p.m. at the South Glens Falls High School Cafeteria. Families can come to the rear of the building where a staff member will provide the meals. Families will not enter the building. Families can also opt for delivery if they are not able to pick up. Families who participate in this program were contacted today.</p>
<p><strong>Academics</strong><br>
Today our teachers met and began to work on plans to provide remote learning resources for our students. If you haven’t already, you will hear from your child’s teacher directly. Families will receive a link to our Home Learning Support for Families website in the next few days as well. Although you’ve likely already heard from your child’s classroom teacher, we will be placing all of the materials online and sharing that resource with you shortly. Some teachers may be mailing supplemental materials home in the next few days. For now, reading and journaling their experience through this is the best first step.</p>
<p><strong>Special Education and Related Services</strong><br>
As the district rolls out academic recommendations for students, it is following state guidance for special education. All special education teachers are in the process of reaching out to students with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) will be continuing to provide what they can to students using the same formats that general education teachers are using.</p>
<ul>
<li>Special education teachers are available to answer questions related to students’ classwork.</li>
<li>As a reminder, students are aware of the online programs available to help them with reading or writing passages.</li>
<li>All related services, including speech or occupational/physical therapy, are creating activities that will be part of our “Home Learning Support for Families” webpage. However, many of these therapies need to be done in person, which is not possible at this time. Due to that, IEP teams will meet when schools are back in session to discuss any make-up sessions or the possibility of summer service.</li>
<li>Psychologists and social workers have placed Social-Emotional support on our home learning support page as well. (Students that are receiving therapy from Saratoga Center For the Family can continue to do so. Your child’s therapist will be in contact with you to get consent so they can provide services through video conferencing. A web link will be provided to families directly so they can sign up and register for the service. We are also in the process of setting up google voice to establish a way of communicating.)</li>
<li>Annual review meetings will continue to be held. Case managers will be reaching out to families that this pertains to. All meetings will be held over the phone. The Committees on Preschool Special Education/Special Education will be contacting you at your scheduled time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 15, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>As you know, all 31 districts in the WSWHE BOCES have canceled class, activities and events through April 19, 2020, as a result of COVID-19/Coronavirus. This includes the South Glens Falls CSD.</p>
<p><strong>Monday, March 16</strong><br>
Faculty and staff will be reporting for a Superintendent’s Conference Day. Teachers and administrators will use this time to plan ways to provide learning opportunities while there are no classes.</p>
<p>The SGF Board of Education Meeting scheduled for Monday, March 16, 2020, will still be held in the transportation building. It will be a shortened format.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, March 17</strong><br>
Elementary schools will be open from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for students to pick up personal items or medicine from the nurse. In order to practice social distancing, only students will be allowed inside the buildings to collect their items and leave quickly. Parents and caregivers are asked to wait outside. A school staff member will accompany each child to their classroom.</p>
<p>Oliver W. Winch Middle School and the high school will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The same social distancing procedures will apply at these buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Academics</strong><br>
Teachers, building principals and the district will be communicating with families about learning materials to use at home. Families should expect to receive more information about staying connected early this week. You will be receiving information from your teachers soon. Please be patient with them. They are trying their best to provide helpful materials for our students.</p>
<p><strong>Internet and WiFi </strong><br>
Spectrum announced Friday it will offer free high-speed internet service and Wi-Fi for 60 days to households with students. Families can call (844) 488-8395 to enroll. Installation fees will be waived for new student households, the company said. Spectrum said regular pricing will take effect at the end of the 60-day period if a customer doesn’t cancel or change the service. <a href="https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-to-offer-free-access-to-spectrum-broadband-and-wifi-for-60-days-for-new-K12-and-college-student-households-and-more">Read more here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Meals</strong><br>
A member of your child’s school will contact all families that receive free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch. Meals will be distributed beginning Tuesday, March 17. Grab-and-go meals for two days will be available for families who qualify on Tuesday and Thursday from 12 to 3 p.m. at the South Glens Falls High School Cafeteria. Families can come to the rear of the building where a staff member will provide the meals. Families will not enter the building. Families can also opt for delivery if they are not able to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>Backpack Program</strong><br>
There are currently 120 students that are part of this program at the elementary level. This program will continue and deliveries will be made to each student’s house on Friday. More information will come later in the week.</p>
<p><strong>Communication With Families</strong><br>
These are unprecedented times. We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate a new normal. In return, we will continue to communicate with you regularly and share new information as soon as possible. Our teachers and principals will need time to reply as they work to support their students.</p>
<p>Please realize that information above may be modified as things change. Please check our district website often for updates. As always, if you have any questions or the health of your family changes, you can contact the superintendent immediately. All information will remain confidential.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Bulldog Families,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alert-300x249.png" alt="" width="300" height="249" class="wp-image-40929 size-medium alignright" srcset="https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alert-300x249.png 300w, https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alert-1024x851.png 1024w, https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alert-768x638.png 768w, https://www.sgfcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alert.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">We are writing with an update on the rapidly developing information regarding COVID-19/Coronavirus. After reviewing all recent information from the Centers for Disease Control and working with the WSWHE BOCES, the South Glens Falls CSD will be canceling classes and all school events and activities through April 19, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19/Coronavirus. At this time there are no confirmed cases of the virus in our school community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district is approaching the closure with the following priorities: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The health and safety of our community. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping our community cope with the closure of the school district by addressing basic needs such as providing free and reduced-price meals to families who need it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans to encourage student learning for the duration of the closure.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Health and Safety</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recognize that this news will be concerning to many of our students and families. We ask that medical questions be directed to your family doctor/healthcare provider. During the closure, if you or one of your family members tests positive for COVID-19/Coronavirus, please contact the district office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A districtwide closure means that all SGF school activities, meetings and events, including sports practices, are canceled. </span></p>
<p><b>Meals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A member of your child’s school will contact all families that receive free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch. We will be distributing food throughout the closure and specific details will be given to each family.</span></p>
<p><b>Backpack Program</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently 120 students that are part of this program at the elementary level.  This program will continue and deliveries will be made to each student’s house on Friday.</span></p>
<p><b>Academic Planning</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although work has already begun on this, the district will have a Superintendent’s Conference Day on Monday for staff to continue reviewing important materials and to create academic plans for your children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers at all levels will be putting together academic plans on Monday. These materials will be shared with families directly and you will be able to find them on the district website (</span><a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.sgfcsd.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Families should expect to receive more information about staying connected during the closure early next week.</span></p>
<p><b>Out of District Placed Students</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will not be transporting private school students and students with special needs, whose placement is outside of the district during this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This situation is constantly evolving. Please stay tuned for updates as each week unfolds. We will be communicating with families via email and posting information on our district website at </span><a href="https://www.sgfcsd.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.sgfcsd.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please know, as always, the health and safety of our students and staff is our highest priority, and we will remain vigilant in our efforts to help prevent the spread of this illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time.</span></p>

<h3>March 13, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>Meeting incoming students is one of our favorite times of the year! However, we have decided to postpone the kindergarten screening scheduled for next week. We look forward to meeting all of our future Bulldogs in the future. When a new date is planned, the district will notify families.</p>
<h3>March 12, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>Our district is continually monitoring guidance and information from our local, state and federal agencies regarding COVID-19. At this time, there are no suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus in the school district. We do have some information to share with you in light of recent conversations and questions we have received.</p>
<ul>
<li>The district has suspended all international travel and all field trips will be postponed through April break. We will review the remainder in the near future.</li>
<li>The OWWMS Production of Wipeout will now be limited to one performance. (See below.)</li>
<li>
<a href="/covid-19-coronavirus-faq/">A FAQ has been placed on the district website here</a>.</li>
<li>Please be aware that the district will continue to update you as soon as possible if there is a confirmed case of COVID-19/Coronavirus in our community. We understand that there may be information circulating in the community, but know that we will post on the website and email critical information as soon as possible.</li>
<li>All use of school buildings by outside groups will be discontinued until further notice. It is important to maintain Kids Korner at each elementary school so that will continue.</li>
<li>The New York State Public High School Athletic Association has said that all state championship games have been postponed. Sadly, this includes our bowling team, which was traveling to Syracuse this weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that you are hearing about school closures across the country. While there have been no decisions for New York state at this time, we are working closely with the department of health to ensure that our buildings are safe. If a closing needs to happen in SGF, we will communicate this immediately. The district is working with its food service, transportation services and the Moreau Community Center to ensure students’ needs are met.</p>
<p>We realize this is a stressful time for many of our families. Our priority is always the health and safety of our community. We committed to communicating with you as new information is available.</p>
<h4>OWWMS Production of Wipeout</h4>
<p>After careful consideration and in the interest of our community’s health, we have decided to limit the OWWMS Drama Club Production of Wipeout to one performance.</p>
<p>One production of the musical will be held on Friday, March 13, 2020, at 7 p.m. at the OWWMS LGI. We respectfully ask that attendees are limited to the immediate family members of the performers.</p>
<p>The musical will be available to watch on a livestream. The link will be posted on our website under the “Announcements” section.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of the hard work our students have put in over the past few months to prepare for this day, and although the final performance will look slightly different than we had envisioned, we know it will still reflect their joy and love of theatre.</p>
<h4>Important message from the Saratoga County Public Health Services</h4>
<p><strong>SARATOGA COUNTY – CALL FIRST!</strong><br>
If you believe you have been exposed or that you have symptoms of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), CALL YOUR DOCTOR. Please do not walk in to your doctor’s office or to the Emergency Room and risk exposing the staff and other patients. If you arrive to Saratoga Hospital, you will be directed to a safe entry at a nearby testing location.<br><strong>For all other questions, call NYS Novel Coronavirus Hotline:</strong> 1-888-364-3065<br><strong>Saratoga County Public Health Services 24-hour emergency line:</strong> 518-584-7460</p>
<h3>March 9, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>Over the course of the weekend, the spread of COVID-19/Coronavirus has caused increasing concern. Given this information, the South Glens Falls CSD has made the difficult decision to cancel all international student travel until further notice.</p>
<p>Please know that the decision did not come lightly. It was made not only to safeguard the students who were scheduled to travel but also to protect their fellow classmates who are staying in-state. Student travel is an incredible learning opportunity, but during this time the district must keep the safety of our students and staff as the first priority.</p>
<p>The district will be reviewing scheduled domestic student trips this week.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions on this can contact the superintendent’s office at 518-793-9617.</p>
<h3>March 4, 2020 Update</h3>
<p>While the South Glens Falls Central School District does not have a confirmed case of novel coronavirus, COVID-19, within its school community, district officials are monitoring information from local, state and federal officials about the newly-emerged virus.</p>
<p>If the district becomes aware that one of our students or staff members is diagnosed with COVID-19, we will notify our community via email. At this time, experts have not recommended that the district cancel or reschedule classes or other school events.</p>
<p>For now, the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and your children is to follow the standard preventive practices for influenza. There are a number of steps that students, staff and community members can take to minimize the spread of all respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, according to the New York State Department of Health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Heavily soiled hands should be washed.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that exposure to COVID-19 can occur from any person-to-person contact and is not limited to a particular race or ethnicity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">More information about COVID-19 is available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/">The state Department of Health also has information available on its website, including a coronavirus hotline</a>.</p>
<p>We are preparing to meet the needs of our students and staff in the event the virus affects our community. Our custodial staff members clean our buildings thoroughly every evening and we are taking special precautions to wipe down “high-touch surfaces” with cleaners that have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and effective against coronavirus.</p>
<p><strong>South High Marathon Dance</strong><br>
The South High Marathon Dance is taking precautions to ensure that our community is practicing good hygiene for the duration of the dance, especially in consideration of recipients who may be attending. Hand sanitizer will be available throughout the building and on the buses. In general, the same attendance recommendations that the district has for general school events stand for SHMD. Please do not come to SHMD if you are sick and take advantage of watching the event live online. Medical personnel will be available throughout the event. As always, a student or attendee who demonstrates any signs of illness may be asked to leave the event.</p>
<p><strong>International Travel</strong><br>
We do not currently have any students expected to travel outside of the country within the next two weeks on a district trip. We are aware of a trip occurring in April. We will continue to monitor the situation and how it may affect upcoming travel and share information with any affected groups as it becomes available.</p>
<p>We appreciate your support of our district and will share more information as it becomes available via email and on our district website at www.sgfcsd.org.</p>
