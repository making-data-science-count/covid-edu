			<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China and has now been detected in almost 90 locations internationally, including in the United States and Olmsted County. Based on reports from places where it has circulated, COVID-19 presents a range of illnesses. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions — like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, are at higher risk.

<p>Additionally, we employ strategic disinfectant procedures during the influenza season. The same cleaning strategies that we use to limit influenza transmission are effective in combating COVID-19. The District continually reviews our crisis plan, including specific pandemic disease preparation strategy. This plan includes details about how we monitor any potential flu-like outbreak in a school building and the various action steps we will use to prevent the spread of illness. </p>

			<p>Right now, the most important actions people in our community can take to prevent illness are simple and effective. The Minnesota Department of Health indicates that following these basic good health practices is the most effective way to protect yourself and your family: </p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Consider getting a seasonal flu shot. It's not too late.</li>
	<li>Make sure to cover coughs and sneezes.</li>
	<li>Encourage frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Model frequent handwashing in your home and workplace.</li>
	<li>Keep children home from school until fever-free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication.</li>
	<li>Stay home from work if you are sick.</li>
	<li>If you plan to go to the doctor with flu-like symptoms, please call ahead so the clinic can be prepared for your arrival.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you may take this opportunity to review your family's emergency plans. Think about backup plans for child care if school is temporarily closed or if parents, children, or a child care provider is sick. Think about necessary items to have at home, including prescription medication (check your refill dates), and non-prescription medications, such as fever-reducing medications.</p>

			<p>Dear RPS Families,</p>

<p>Today, April 23, Governor Walz extended Distance Learning through the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. The “Stay at Home” order from Governor Walz remains in effect until May 4. </p>

<p>This is what this means for Rochester Public Schools students:</p>

</ul>
<p> </p>

<h4><b>PERSONAL ITEMS &amp; DISTRICT ISSUED MATERIALS</b></h4>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Each school will be working on a process for families to retrieve personal items that have been left at school. Please be patient with us as we work through these plans. </li>
	<li>Each school will be working with families on returning District-issued technology, text books, etc. once the school year ends. Please continue to use these materials until further notice. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<ul type="disc">

</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>All High School proms are canceled. Please watch for more communication from your school regarding prom.</li>

</ul>
<p> </p>

Thank you to our families, our volunteers, and all of the critical workers on the front lines of this pandemic. Together, we will get through this. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

			<p>Dear Community, Families, Staff, and Students, </p>

<p>Right now, we are concerned and anxious about the challenges our community and students are facing. Our community and Rochester Public Schools (RPS) are meeting challenges we didn't know existed. I am incredibly grateful for our staff: teachers, paraprofessionals, bus drivers, facilities, food service, technology, front office, and administrators. They, along with our amazing community volunteers, have and continue to work together to meet these new challenges. </p>

<p>While this is a national emergency, it has become very personal for all of us. We are all trying to find ways to connect and to provide the necessities of daily life without exposing ourselves or anyone else to COVID-19. </p>

<p>Nothing is more serious or important to me than making sure our students and their families have what they need during this time. We are living in remarkable days. Schools and parks are closed, many jobs are furloughed, establishments are losing business, and we are told to stay at home. That is all very difficult, but we are all in this together. </p>

<p>I know many parents are more worried about their children now than ever before. Even though we cannot change some of the outcomes from the mandatory closures of schools and sports, the District will continue to provide as much help as possible during this time. We understand that it will take time to get used to distance learning. Our teachers and staff are guiding the learning experiences and are available to help. Please be patient with us and yourselves, as we adapt to distance learning, meal distribution, and childcare. We are all working outside our comfort zones. </p>

<p>We spent the eight days before Spring Break working hard, preparing for our new distance learning model. We are proud of the personal contact our staff provides to our students during the typical school year. Now, it is challenging for the staff to do this effectively online. As your teachers reach out, please know that they are offering support to parents and students. RPS teachers want to connect to give a semblance of normalcy for students. They want to provide the students with activities to keep their minds engaged during this closure. We want every student to participate in the distance learning opportunities daily, and that you feel comfortable emailing your teachers directly. Our goal is for your child to stay connected with teachers and to keep on pace with their learning during this time. </p>

<p>Please be assured that RPS is here to help our families and not to create added anxiety. RPS has always placed emphasis on supporting the mental and emotional wellbeing of our students and families. To that end, we have established a link on each school's website that may assist you, or your child, if you are experiencing emotional challenges as we continue to navigate this difficult time together. </p>

<p>Every day I am amazed at the stories I hear of community members helping those in need: like those who are sewing masks, volunteers and businesses who continue to make sure all people are fed, and all of the health care workers and first responders that go into their jobs every day to help protect all of us. </p>

<p>Rochester Public Schools wants to support you. We are providing meals to all children ages 0-18 at 22 locations throughout our community. We are providing emergency child care at Jefferson, and Sunset Terrace elementary schools for children of emergency workers at no charge from 9 AM to 3:45 PM for children Kindergarten through age 12 in eligible families through Friday, May 1. In addition, fee-based Extended Care will be available 6:30-9 AM and 3:45-6 PM for children attending Emergency Child Care. All of this information is available at rochesterschools.org/COVID-19. We are here working to support you during this time of difficulty. </p>

<p>Please, try not to stress over school-related issues. We are all in this together. Call us if you need reassurance or have questions. This is a national health crisis, and we do not want to create additional stress over schoolwork. At the same time, engaging in schoolwork can help. The most important thing you all can do is to stay home and stay healthy. We want to support you in whatever way we are able. Please keep caring for one another and know that we miss having school, too. </p>

<p>Please remember, if you are not an essential worker, stay at home as Governor Walz ordered. Keep your social distancing and practice good hygiene. Wash your hands often. Take care of your families and loved ones first and foremost. This is the number one priority at this time. </p>

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, thoughts, ideas, suggestions, please contact your teacher via email. If you have any general concerns about your grade level, please contact your principal. If you have any district-wide concerns, please contact me. Please hang in there and find time to appreciate and enjoy your loved ones. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Michael Muñoz <br>Superintendent <br>Rochester Public Schools </p>

			<p>To the RPS Graduating Class of 2020, </p>

<p>I know you may be disappointed, upset, confused, and sad—this is not how the last three months of your senior year was supposed to go. You're potentially missing out on being able to enjoy the final months of your senior year – hanging out with your friends. You may lose experiences like competing with your classmates on spring sports teams, the chance to attend senior prom. This was the year that your entire schooling was building up to. But it was taken from you because of the global pandemic. Naturally, you may be feeling sad—this situation has undoubtedly created a sense of loss. </p>

<p>We are still holding out hope that we can have graduation as usual. However, if the coronavirus continues to keep us from gathering, we will figure out some creative way to honor and celebrate you. I know that I will never forget the Class of 2020. I'll always remember the sacrifices you are making to protect the health and safety of our community. I believe that you will learn more about yourself from this bizarre experience caused by COVID-19, and emerge from this season with more life vision, ambition, and determination than ever before. Maya Angelou once said, "You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it." There is wisdom in her words. You see, life is not an endless series of pleasant experiences—we all learn from adversity. We learn about our character, our resolve, and we develop plans to move us forward. </p>

<p>There is no pandemic strong enough to silence you or dent the passion of your generation. Keep your head up and keep fighting. Our country needs you because you provide hope for our future. This year may not be what you envisioned, but I'm eager to see what you do with it. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Michael Muñoz <br>Superintendent <br>Rochester Public Schools </p>

			<p>Dear Families: </p>

<p>We want to take this opportunity to connect with families of students with Rochester Public Schools who receive special education services. First of all, we want to thank each and every one of you for your patience and understanding during this break from school to allow our staff to prepare for Distance Learning. We know it is not an easy situation for anyone, and it is truly appreciated. </p>

<p>As we prepare for changes in the way we provide education through Distance Learning, this will adjust our delivery in special education services. Our special education teachers and paraprofessionals are working together to determine the best method to provide special education services and supports as seamlessly as possible to our students. We know that Distance Learning services will not look the same as they do when students are face-to-face at school. However, our goal is to continue to meet the individual needs of our students with your support and continuing guidance from the Minnesota Department of Education. </p>

<p>Parents/guardians, you can expect to receive communication from your child’s case manager to discuss the details of the Distance Learning Plan for your child. That will be followed up by an IEP Addendum including the written changes, as well as a Prior Written Notice requesting parental consent. </p>

<p>Each student will receive a daily contact by a certified teacher. These contacts may include one or more of the following: personal check-in, virtual/online instruction, paper work tasks, electronic or paper textbooks, phone call instruction, other online resources, teletherapy for speech services, consultation for language services, occupational therapy and/or physical therapy. </p>

<p>In terms of Individual Education Program (IEP) meetings during Distance Learning, we will resume meeting later this spring in a virtual manner (either telephone, on-line meetings) to determine what services will be like when we resume back at school. Re-evaluations that are coming due will proceed, with parent permission, using methods that do not require face-to-face contact. </p>

<p>The services currently in your child’s IEP will continue once we resume face-to-face instruction. Rochester Public Schools has taken the guidance from the U.S. Department of Education, the Minnesota Department of Education, and Governor Walz in all of these decisions. </p>

<p>Thank you again for your continued support! </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Jennifer Ihrke, Director of Special Education </p>

<p>Nicole Mueller, Assistant Director of Special Education Secondary </p>

<p>Melissa Stenke,  Assistant Director of Special Education Elementary </p>

			<p dir="ltr">Dear RPS Families,</p>

<p>Today, March 25, Governor Walz announced an executive order for Minnesotans to “Stay at Home” beginning Friday, March 27, at 11:59 PM through Friday, April 10. The Governor authorized the Education Commissioner to extend Distance Learning from March 30 through at least May 1. </p>

<p>This is what this means for Rochester Public Schools students.</p>

<h4>DISTANCE LEARNING</h4>

<ul>
<li>Spring Break for RPS students is Friday, March 27, through Sunday, April 5.
	<ul>
<li>Distance Learning will not occur during Spring Break</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Distance Learning will begin for all RPS students, other than Longfellow Elementary students, on Monday, April 6.</li>
	<li>Distance Learning will begin for Longfellow Elementary students on Monday, April 13. </li>
	<li>You can expect communication from your school on or before Monday, April 6, on what Distance Learning will look like for your child. </li>
	<li>At this time, Distance Learning will occur Monday, April 6, through April 30. The Minnesota Department of Education will continue to re-evaluate the Distance Learning schedule, and this is subject to an extension. In the event that we are able to return to learning in the classroom in May, the first day back for students would be Tuesday, May 5. The Commissioner of Education reserved Friday, May 1, and Monday, May 4, for “planning” days for our district staff. Staff would report these days, students would not. Again, this is subject to change.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>CHILD CARE</h4>

<p>Beginning April 6, the District will continue emergency child care for Tier 1 and Tier 2 <a href="https://education.mn.gov/mdeprod/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=MDE032076&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=latestReleased&amp;Rendition=primary" target="_blank">emergency workers</a>, including Rochester Public Schools staff whose work cannot be done from home.</p>

</ul>
<h4>MEAL SERVICE </h4>

<p>The District will continue to provide meal service for our students during this time frame. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>March 30 - April 3</em>: Walk/Drive-Up Service available at Gage Elementary, Riverside Elementary, Sunset Terrace Elementary, John Adams Middle, Willow Creek Middle, and Mayo High from 11 AM - 12:30 PM on weekdays. </li>

</ul>
<p>We appreciate your patience and understanding during this constantly changing time. Thank you to our families, our volunteers, and all of the critical workers on the front lines of this pandemic. Together, we will get through this. </p>

			<h4>COVID-19 Emergency Child Care Information</h4>

<p>Dear RPS Families, </p>

<p>As you may know, on Sunday, March 15, Governor Walz directed school districts to cancel classes starting Wednesday, March 18, to focus staff on developing a distance learning plan, should the need arrive for school districts to close for an extended period due to COVID-19. </p>

<p>Governor Walz also directed schools to provide free childcare during school hours to children of emergency workers, which the Minnesota Department of Education has further defined in the document, “School-Age Care for Children of Emergency Workers.” The State is also allowing districts to provide fee-based extended care to that same population for emergency worker parents who require longer coverage.</p>

<p>Rochester Public Schools is following these directives and will begin providing care at all sixteen of our elementary schools for children of emergency workers, as defined in the document, “<a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/nL0QEkIrl4uOPKVkxSh3Lw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgUUpqP0R1aHR0cHM6Ly9tc2cuc2Nob29sbWVzc2VuZ2VyLmNvbS9tLz9zPUNvLWtkT0EtdnA0Jm1hbD1hYmJhNjEzYjFjNzU4NDc5MzQ2MDQyOGQ5MmMxMGMzMDhjMzU4YWM3MmE5ODYyNGU3Yjg5NTM5ZGFhMTQ0YTYyVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAOoWcF6VGCYmUh1jYWdlaGxpbmdAcm9jaGVzdGVyLmsxMi5tbi51c1gEAAAAAQ~~">School-Age Care for Children of Emergency Workers</a> .” <strong>Emergency Child Care </strong>will be available at no charge from 9 AM to 3:45 PM for children Kindergarten through Age 12 in eligible families starting Wednesday, March 18, and continuing on weekdays through Thursday, March 26. In addition, fee-based <strong>Extended Care</strong> will be available 6:30-9 AM and 3:45-6 PM for children attending Emergency Child Care.</p>

			<p>Dear RPS Families, </p>

<p>Rochester Public Schools (RPS) is continuing to monitor the situation regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as it continues to evolve. We participated today in a teleconference with the Minnesota Departments of Health and Education and observed the Governor’s press conference on this topic.</p>

<p>As of today, March 15, 2020, Governor Tim Walz and Education Commissioner Mary Cathryn Ricker have issued an executive order for school closures across the entire state of Minnesota from March 18 through March 27. Rochester Public Schools will be following this directive. In addition, Spring Break is scheduled from March 30 - April 3. <strong>This means RPS students will not attend school from Wednesday, March 18 - April 5. </strong></p>

<p>The Governor has designated March 18 through March 27 as a planning period to prepare for remote learning in the event that closures extend beyond this time period. All staff will report as scheduled during the planning period. </p>

<p>Here is what this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>March 16 and March 17:</strong> students and staff will report as normal. Families may opt to keep their students at home and this will be considered an excused absence. Please continue to follow our regular process of contacting the school if your student will be absent on either of these days. Regular School Age Child Care (SACC) will be available for registered participants.</li>
	<li>

<p>Dear RPS Families,</p>

<p>Rochester Public Schools (RPS) is continuing to monitor the situation regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as it continues to evolve. We participated today in a teleconference with the Minnesota Departments of Health and Education and observed the Governor’s press conference on this topic.</p>

<p>As of today, Governor Walz has declared a peacetime state of emergency, which identifies new strategies for “social distancing” to reduce the chance for person-to-person transmission. These include cancellation of gatherings that exceed 250 people or more, smaller gatherings that do not allow sufficient space among participants, and gatherings of ten or more people where the majority of participants are of high risk. A copy of these new strategies is available here: <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/8q4zP1tFY4IFW5LeWy7Bvw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgTSDPP0Q-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGVhbHRoLnN0YXRlLm1uLnVzL2Rpc2Vhc2VzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWxXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAT-1rXkVYXh5SHWNhZ2VobGluZ0Byb2NoZXN0ZXIuazEyLm1uLnVzWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>The Governor, Minnesota Department of Health, and Minnesota Department of Education have not recommended general school closures at this time.<strong> Rochester Public Schools remains open. </strong>Any decision on closure would be a joint decision with these entities.</p>

<p>In an effort to reduce the chance for person-to-person transmission, Rochester Public Schools will take the following actions effective immediately and until further notice:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Cancel all gatherings of 250 or more participants</li>
	<li>Cancel all field trips</li>
	<li>Discontinue all use of Volunteers in Education (VIE) in schools</li>
	<li>Follow Minnesota State High School League direction for all MSHSL programs</li>
	<li>Advise all district building renters of the “social distancing” requirements and cancel reservations where the requirements cannot be met</li>
</ul>
<p>School buildings and district departments will be communicating with their students, families, staff, and partners about individual events that may also need to be canceled to reduce transmission.</p>

<p>Thank you, <br>
Rochester Public Schools</p>

			<p>At this time, we are asking our visitors to limit their time in our buildings to reduce the chance of person-to-person transmission. Beginning on Monday, March 16, 2020, we are discontinuing volunteer services until further notice. We hope this will only be for a short time and look forward to having our schools full with volunteers again soon. We truly appreciate all you do for Rochester Public Schools.</p>

<p><b>Statement on Minnesota State High School League Postseason Tournament and COVID-19 </b></p>

<p>The Minnesota State High School League, relying on information from the Minnesota Department of Health, will limit the number of people at tournaments beginning Friday, March 13, 2020. This decision will impact Girls Basketball Semifinals and Finals, the Adapted Floor Hockey Tournament, and Section Boys Basketball games. As the COVID-19 situation is rapidly evolving, plans for events held after this weekend are still being developed and will be communicated at a later date. </p>

<p>All state and section championship brackets will be played. Consolation and third place games for State Girls Basketball and Adapted Floor Hockey have been cancelled. </p>

<p>Attendance at tournaments is now limited to rostered participants, coaches, event staff, TV network partners, credentialed media, and a small number of school-approved spectators of each participating team. </p>

<p>It is critical that all attendees at tournaments follow the recommendations regarding personal hygiene and avoidance of contact with anyone who is experiencing respiratory complications or fever. Any potential attendee who does not feel well, participant or fan, is expected to refrain from attending tournaments. </p>

<p>Schools will receive information from the MSHSL regarding the process and submission of their list of designated spectators. All designated spectators must present an ID and purchase a ticket to enter the venue. </p>

<p>Fans are encouraged to follow state tournaments through broadcast, streaming and/or social media. Girls Basketball games will be broadcast on Channel 45TV and via streaming at 45tv.com/prep45. The Adapted Floor Hockey Championship will be broadcast via livestream on prepspotlight.tv. Twitter Accounts to follow are @mshsl, @MSHSLjohn, Facebook @mshsl.org, and Instagram @mshsl1. </p>

<p>Executive Director Erich Martens shared: </p>

<p>“While the changes in our tournaments are unfortunate, we recognize that a collective community response is critical to supporting the health of our communities and mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The MSHSL intends to do everything possible to allow participating students who have earned the opportunity to compete in these special tournaments to do so. We will continue to follow guidance from the </p>

<p>Minnesota Department of Health, The Centers for Disease Control, and the State of Minnesota and will work with League member schools to finish this winter season in the best way possible. We appreciate the partnership with our venues who have gone above and beyond in preparing their venues with additional cleaning and appropriate disease prevention.” </p>

<p>Updates will be posted as necessary to the MSHSL website: https://legacy.mshsl.org/ </p>

			<p><b>COVID-19 Update</b><br>
March 11, 2020</p>

<p>Dear RPS Families, <br>
Rochester Public Schools (RPS) is continuing to monitor the situation regarding the coronavirus (COVID-19) as it continues to evolve. We have heard from families who are seeking guidance on precautions and received questions on what the District is doing to prepare. </p>

<p>We will continue to update staff, families, and community members through our normal communication channels. We will also provide updates on our website.</p>

<p>This update is intended to give you some additional guidance.</p>

<p><strong>What is COVID-19? </strong><br>
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China and has now been detected in almost 90 locations internationally, including in the United States and Olmsted County. Based on reports from places where it has circulated, COVID-19 presents a range of illnesses. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions — like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, are at higher risk. Source: <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/DimZvxphsAtCN961pX9Pxg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgSomIP0QpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8yMDE5LW5jb3ZXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAACFZpXgZZB8RSHWNhZ2VobGluZ0Byb2NoZXN0ZXIuazEyLm1uLnVzWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">CDC</a></p>

<p><strong>What is the Rochester Public Schools doing about COVID-19? </strong><br>
We employ strategic disinfectant procedures during the influenza season. The same cleaning strategies that we use to limit influenza transmission are effective in combating COVID-19. The District is reviewing our crisis plan and working to update a specific pandemic disease preparation strategy. This plan includes details about how we monitor any potential flu outbreak in a school building and the various action steps we will use to prevent the spread of illness. </p>

<p><strong>Will school be closed or activities canceled due to COVID-19? </strong><br>
In making a determination on school closures due to illness, the District would work with local partners like Olmsted County Public Health Services (OCPHS), Minnesota Department of Health, and the Minnesota Department of Education. We are continuously monitoring how the virus is impacting our community. The District maintains a list of school-related activities and events which will be monitored for possible cancelation. School closures and activity cancellations are sent directly to families via Skylert, and are posted on our official social media channels, as well as on our website. </p>

<p><strong>What will happen should schools be closed and activities canceled due to COVID-19? </strong><br>
The District is taking steps for contingency planning should closures become necessary. The building principals will be seeking input this week from staff with respect to lesson planning and preparedness. The District is also taking steps to determine if District technology resource-sharing is an option for families who do not have access at home. In addition, our Student Nutrition Services is currently working on possible plans to provide breakfast and lunch for our students due to an extended closure.</p>

<p><strong>Will the District provide child care should schools be closed due to COVID-19? </strong><br>
No, the District will not provide child care should schools be closed due to COVID-19. Parents should consider other arrangements if closure becomes necessary. </p>

<p><strong>What actions should we take to protect our family? </strong><br>
Right now, the most important actions people in our community can take to prevent illness are simple and effective. The Minnesota Department of Health indicates that following these basic good health practices is the most effective way to protect yourself and your family: </p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Consider getting a seasonal flu shot. It's not too late.</li>
	<li>Make sure to cover coughs and sneezes.</li>
	<li>Encourage frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Model frequent handwashing in your home and workplace.</li>
	<li>Keep children home from school until fever-free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication.</li>
	<li>Stay home from work if you are sick.</li>
	<li>If you plan to go to the doctor with flu-like symptoms, please call ahead so the clinic can be prepared for your arrival.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you may take this opportunity to review your family's emergency plans. Think about backup plans for child care if school is temporarily closed or if parents, children, or a child care provider is sick. Think about necessary items to have at home, including prescription medication (check your refill dates), and non-prescription medications, such as fever-reducing medications. </p>

<p><strong>Are there resources for parents to talk with their children about COVID-19? </strong><br>
The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) has prepared guidance for parents to talk with their children about COVID-19. </p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Read the NASP guidance in <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/9xT42cpEFEUrDk4LVoD1OA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgSomIP0TIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmFzcG9ubGluZS5vcmcvcmVzb3VyY2VzLWFuZC1wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMvcmVzb3VyY2VzLWFuZC1wb2RjYXN0cy9zY2hvb2wtY2xpbWF0ZS1zYWZldHktYW5kLWNyaXNpcy9oZWFsdGgtY3Jpc2lzLXJlc291cmNlcy90YWxraW5nLXRvLWNoaWxkcmVuLWFib3V0LWNvdmlkLTE5LShjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyktYS1wYXJlbnQtcmVzb3VyY2VXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAACFZpXgZZB8RSHWNhZ2VobGluZ0Byb2NoZXN0ZXIuazEyLm1uLnVzWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">English</a>

			<p>Dear RPS Families,</p>

<p>Rochester Public Schools (RPS) is keenly aware of the Wuhan Coronavirus COVID-19 and the concerns that may continue to arise in our community. </p>

<p>Our District follows the guidance and direction of our expert partners, Olmsted County Public Health Services (OCPHS)  and the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), with respect to illness and infectious diseases. The most recent protocols related to COVID-19 set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been shared with our entire staff and RPS families earlier this week. We understand the protocols may change as more information becomes available and we coordinate regularly with OCPHS to assure that we understand the most recent information and changes. Communication with our staff, students, and families is critical, and we are committed to continued communication with our stakeholders. We continue to work closely with our partner organizations to best address the needs of our community.</p>

<p>RPS is part of a strong network of community organizations. Together, we meet to discuss our collaborative planning and response to public health emergencies. Our relationship and continued practice with <a href="https://www.co.olmsted.mn.us/OCPHS/Pages/default.aspx" title="Link to Olmsted County Public Health Services">OCPHS</a>, <a href="https://www.olmmed.org/" title="Link to Olmsted Medical Center Website">Olmsted Medical Center</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" title="Link to Mayo Clinic website">Mayo Clinic</a>, <a href="https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/rch/" title="Link to Federal Medical Center website">Federal Medical Center</a>, <a href="https://www.rochestermn.gov/departments/emergency-management" title="Link to City of Rochester MN Emergency Management website">City and County Emergency Management</a>, first responders and others, assure we are working together to prepare, plan, and respond in the best way possible for the health and safety of our community. </p>

<p>The District follows the MDH guidelines as it relates to the daily cleaning and decontamination of our facilities. It is also our daily practice to track our students’ illness symptoms and absences and report necessary information to Olmsted County Public Health Services (OCPHS). OCPHS monitors student illnesses and provides guidance on additional facilities services and communication as needed.</p>

<p>Questions about E-Learning Days have been asked, presumably in the event of an extended school closure due to illness. The District does not use E-Learning Days at this time. Here is why:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Equity with devices. Not all of our students have a district-issued take-home device. Some students may have devices at home but lack internet access. Some students may not have access to any device at home. </li>
	<li>Equity with learning at home and adult support. Not all of our students have access to an adult that can assist with e-learning. </li>
	<li>Teacher contract. Our current teacher contract does not address E-learning. This is a topic that would need to be discussed and negotiated with the Rochester Education Association, our teachers’ union. </li>
	<li>State Statute. <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/120A.414" title="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/120A.414">Minnesota State Statute 120A.414 Subdivision 1</a> states that "‘E-learning day’ means a school day where a school offers full access to online instruction provided by students' individual teachers due to inclement weather. A school district or charter school that chooses to have e-learning days may have up to five e-learning days in one school year. An e-learning day is counted as a day of instruction and included in the hours of instruction under section <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/120A.41">120A.41</a>.” Our interpretation of the statute is that E-learning days can only be used for weather-related closures. </li>
</ul>
<p>For now, it is business as usual at RPS. The District does not have plans to close schools at this time. In the event of a school closure due to illness, the District would work with local partners like OCPHS, MDH, and the Minnesota Department of Education. We continue to practice healthy habits, such as hand washing, covering your mouth when you cough, and so on. We remind parents, guardians, staff, and students they should refrain from coming to school or work when they are sick and only return to school or work once they are fever-free for 24 hours. </p>

<p>As a collaborative effort, we are also sharing statements from the <a href="https://www.rochestermn.gov/Home/Components/News/News/7518/1121?backlist=%2f" title="Link to City of Rochester website for COVID-19 Statement">City of Rochester</a> and Olmsted County Public Health. </p>

<p>February 25, 2020 </p>

<p>To: Public Health Partners<br>
Subject: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Update </p>

<p>With the international outbreak of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) continuing to create daily headlines, employers, staff, parents and students may have questions and concerns – particularly if there are staff or students with ties to or recent travel to areas directly affected by the outbreak. To help address questions within the school context, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has prepared a special section of its website with specific recommendations for schools. </p>

<p>The risk to the general public and Minnesotans remains low and there is no current evidence to suggest COVID-19 is widely circulating in the U.S. However, this could change given new information about recent outbreaks in south Korea, Iran and Italy. Please note, that as of February 25, 2020, there are no cases in Minnesota. </p>

<p>To slow the potential spread of COVID-19 into the U.S., travel restrictions were implemented by the U.S. Federal Government on February 2, 2020. Olmsted County Public Health is actively working with MDH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure that travelers returning from impacted areas are being screened for infection during their return travel. Monitoring of asymptomatic travelers is being done all around the country. The CDC is currently recommending any travelers returning from China to remain out of work and school, and limit interactions with others for 14 days after departure from China. Public Health officials check in with travelers daily and monitor for symptoms and assure adherence to the guidelines. After the monitoring period, they will have no further restrictions. We continue to work closely with our medical partners on plans to evaluate potential cases in our area while minimizing the risk to the public. This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation; guidelines and travel restrictions may change. For the most current information, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. </p>

<p>As this situation continues to unfold, it is important that everyone follow standard prevention practices to reduce the spread of contagious diseases, including influenza and COVID-19: </p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. </li>
	<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your sleeve – not in your hands </li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth </li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
	<li>Stay home from school, work and activities if you are ill </li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at (507) 328-7500. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Graham Briggs, Director <br>
Olmsted County Public Health </p>
