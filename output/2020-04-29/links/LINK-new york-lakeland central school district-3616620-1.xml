                            <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted April 27, 2020</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Community Update<br><a href="community%20update%204-27-20.pdf" target="_blank">Versión en español haga clic aquí </a></span></strong><br><p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">As we approach the end of the school year, I know everyone still has many unanswered questions. The Governor has stated this week we will learn some of the outcomes that involve our schools, and we anxiously await the information. As we plan, we have come to recognize that whether we return to schools this year (highly unlikely) or next year, we will need very detailed re-entry plans. That might include distancing, reading temperatures, constant sanitizing, and many other factors we haven't even considered. To imagine the challenges, take busing, for example. If we are required to keep students six feet apart, using every bench seat with one student would double the number of bus runs. Classrooms would have to be reduced in size, and lunch periods would obviously pose additional challenges. I know that all of you are concerned about the issues that you as families are dealing with, including instruction, end of year ceremonies, special services, and countless others; we will do our best. I want all of us to understand the scope of the situation.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<span style="color: #000000;">Aside from our programs, the biggest looming issue for the District is when we will know our revenues for the coming year so we can prepare a budget. This seems to be taking a back seat at the moment, but it is critical to programming for next year. We have a budget prepared, but we keep delaying adoption based upon the changing figures we are getting related to our state aid. As it continues to decline, we must adjust everything else as well.  We are waiting as long as we can to finalize the numbers, which would start with the date for a budget and trustee election.  With the Democratic and Republican primaries now cancelled, it may be decided not to hold an election for schools, we just aren't sure at this point. There will however, still be primary elections for other offices, on that day.  What we do know is that we will survive financially thanks to our years of careful savings, and we will keep our tax rate change as low as we possibly can, recognizing how many families are struggling.</span><br><br>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">I know the end of year grading is a concern, and we are working with districts in our region to finalize the plans. As I am sure, you can imagine, it is extremely difficult to know what is going on in each individual household, and whether all students have access to equal education. If classes report participation rates are down, we need to know why. Is it a lack of effort, or is it a lack of available time and resources. These are key questions that limit "traditional" instruction and assessment, and it would not be fair to establish a system that does not consider these factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">We are beginning the planning for extended school year services for identified students, and a possible credit recovery path if needed for students who may fail Regents courses. I have meetings regarding these programs later this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Let's talk about some positives! I can't say enough about how many volunteers have stepped up to the plate and how many donations have come in for local food pantries. Ours alone has distributed over 20,000 meals since the middle of March, so thank you to everyone who is helping with the effort. The fact that the number keeps growing every distribution shows how much more serious the economy has gotten as we stay shut down. We also want to thank our daycare providers who continue to offer services to essential workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">The biggest question on the minds of seniors, of course, is graduation and the prom. I am happy to report I intend to hold a graduation ceremony within the guidelines of the health department. If we are not permitted to hold it in our stadiums, then we will find a suitable location for graduates and their parents to come in cars, and then conduct a ceremony. The rest of this week, I will be in touch with various groups who are willing to help us with these plans. One way or the other, we will make something very meaningful, maybe even entertaining happen for our graduates! As far as the prom and other ceremonies go, I am leaving that to the schools, supervised by our very competent and dedicated school principals. Working with student leadership, they will come up with some great ideas for ending the year in style.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">We are approaching "Teacher Appreciation Week," (the first week in May), and I certainly thank all of them for everything they are doing. I was happy to see that Governor Cuomo identified educators as "essential employees," and rightfully so. Maybe, however, this should be Lakeland Appreciation Week, since so many, in so many roles are doing so, so much for the greater Lakeland Community. In our wildest dreams, we never imagined this, but somehow we rise to the occasion!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">More to come at the end of the week.<br></span><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">I want to send a special "Thank You" to everyone donating or volunteering with our food distribution efforts as well as St. Mary's. Today, a special shout-out goes to the Lakeland Federation of Teachers, who will be making significant donations in the next few weeks. Just another way, Lakeland staff take it well beyond the classroom!<br><br>Our Pupil Personnel Services is working tirelessly to provide support services to families and students, here are a few highlights:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Student Assistance Counselors are now working shifts on our District emotional support Helpline. the number is 914-603-9089</span></li>

Go to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="http://www.livebinders.com/b/2643001" target="_blank">http://www.livebinders.com/b/2643001</a></span><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true"><br></span>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">All Supervisors and CSE Chairs are now conducting CSE meetings, so we continue to identify and serve.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">We are reviewing the means to improve online registration procedures.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">SEPTA (our Special Education Parent Teacher Organization) has been working with the District to plan for virtual activities for parents with special needs students.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">School psychologists are sharing online testing resources. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">All related services providers are conducting Teletherapy sessions starting this week. All identified families will be contacted.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Yesterday we received official word that all graduation events at Westchester County Center have been canceled. As I noted earlier, we will continue to plan for a number of alternatives. Our first choice would be to hold distanced graduations hopefully with immediate family if allowed, in our school stadiums or some larger parking areas. The tentative dates would be either Saturday, June 20th, or Saturday, June 27th. Regardless of whether the Governor restricts the use of schools or gatherings of any size, we will be looking at designing video productions so that there will be lasting memories and recorded ceremonies either way. Hopefully, we can do both a real ceremony and the production, but at the least, we will do something this year. Should we not be permitted to conduct a ceremony, then we could always use our stadiums next year for a formal ceremony. Columbus Day weekend and Thanksgiving weekend are dates that have been suggested for times when students frequently return home.<br><br>All other activities such as award ceremonies, moving up ceremonies, honor society inductions, anything that we traditionally hold, we will be working to produce online. Should we be able to return, we could hold distanced moving up ceremonies as well. PTA's are also generating ideas and working with their school leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Later this week, I will be meeting with my District Youth Council to hear what ideas, concerns, and reflections they have on the current conditions we face. I will report back next week following that meeting. After the first of May, I will convene a parent forum on the issues of May and June events.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">The Walter Panas new field complex is deep into the design phase now that we have finally worked out arrangements with the New York Department of Environmental Protection (concerning the NY watershed below Panas). Plans and approvals will take months, but at least it is on track for next year's construction. If the numbers are good, it will also include a new parking lot, which is certainly needed. This project was already budgeted and funded, and will not be impacted by the current budget concerns, other than significant costs over budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">As many of you have probably heard, this will be a very difficult year financially for districts such as Lakeland who depend heavily on State Aid. In our budget, we have estimated a decrease in aid of approximately 10% or almost 4 million dollars. Later comments from the Governor indicated it could be as high as 20%. At the end of this update is a message from NYSSBA (New York State School Boards) along with a link for citizens to contact the federal government about providing additional school aid to New York. If you would like to participate, the letter is already in place.<br></span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, I know the longer these conditions go on, the more stressful it can be for many of you. While the bonding that families are sharing may help our students down the road when things return to normal, many families are struggling to balance work and their children's needs.  For families with young children who require much more constant guided attention, this can be exhausting. If those same families have adults working as first responders or in health care, I can only imagine how stressful it must be. We want to help and we are offering as much help as we possibly can. While schools and teachers are trying to adapt to the levels and needs of their students, we know there is just as great a need for social and emotional support so please feel free to reach out. For our employees and their families, remember the EAP, Employee Assistance Program, a great and free resource. For others please don't hesitate to use our hotline and other resources. </span></div>

<div class="news-desc">
<span style="color: #000000;">In my updates on Friday (April 17), I noted that there might be a problem utilizing district funds for an event in the following year for students who have graduated. We are following up along with other districts and will make adjustments if necessary. Please know my preference remains a "distanced" ceremony at our schools if we are allowed to come back prior to June 30th. If we utilize our stadiums and limit the attendance to immediate families spaced apart, we could potentially have a meaningful ceremony. In addition, since we would not be locked into a single date with the County Center, we could schedule it earlier and have rain dates to follow. I want to hold a focus group with parents and students in May to discuss these and alternate plans if necessary. By that time, we should have direction from the Governor and NYSED as to whether we can return to hold such a ceremony or not. Until then, let's remain committed to making something good happen, and continue to hope for the best. I hope this helps to decrease anxiety. Together, we will come up with a solution.</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">George Stone, Superintendent</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong><strong>Posted April 17, 2020<br>Community Update<br><a href="Community%20Update%204-17%20Spanish.pdf" target="_blank">Versión en español haga clic aquí </a></strong></strong></strong><br><span>As I'm sure everyone has heard, we are now closed through May 15th. While we would love to have a month or even a few weeks to see our students before the year officially ends, it is getting harder to remain optimistic. If we do return, there would be a number of conditions to be met, which more than likely would include distancing, masks, and taking temperatures. These concerns would be aside from debate among parents whether to send their children or not as well as staff concerns about their health. Again, while I am personally "climbing the walls" to get back as much as anyone, there will be no easy way to re-enter this year.</span><br><br><span>That leads to the questions surrounding senior celebrations and, in particular, graduation and the prom. While the response from students and parents has been overwhelmingly in favor of holding these celebrations in the summer or fall (assuming large gatherings are allowed and safe), my colleagues who have spoken with state auditors indicate there would be a problem for Districts that want to pay for any activities, celebrations, or events after the school year ends when seniors are no longer enrolled as students in our district. It would be considered a gift of public funds. If that is accurate, it would require events after June 30th to be sponsored by other groups, and the costs would be significant.</span><br><br><span>Last evening I was helping my second grade granddaughter with a social studies lesson about "the economy." It included a section about "wants and needs," and it got me thinking. We all WANT to hold these celebrations and feel it is very unfair that we can't, but what I believe we NEED is to find a way to bring closure and a way to acknowledge these milestones in our students' school careers. True, there may be no traditional prom, no traditional graduation, but there are also no sports, no concerts, art exhibits, no picnics, or other traditional activities. Everyone is forced to adjust, and we have to come to terms with the reality of a "new normal." I have heard from various parents and groups who are working on a number of small celebratory activities such as signs for cars, banners across the road, etc. and we appreciate any support parent groups can offer. With all that is on our plate now, we are working on completing the year and making plans for the traditional activities.</span><br><br><span>Somehow though, we have to make some tough but realistic decisions. I have already directed the principals to begin producing the senior awards and eighth grade awards as video productions. I have been in touch with a Lakeland graduate who is now an event planner, and is committed to helping us produce unique and inspiring celebrations should we conclude that we have no other choice. This doesn't mean we cannot hold gatherings once they are permitted, but it is still our goal to ensure we provide some culminating activities for our seniors before this year ends. In the next week or two, I will be holding conference calls with both the District Youth Council and the District Parents Council to get some final suggestions.</span><br><br><span>While I am personally focused on seniors and the end of their year, we are all working on the needs that all other returning students will have next year. There will be many varied skill levels even within each grade and class. Students may need a period of review at the beginning of the year for teachers to help get everyone on a similar level. We are anticipating a number of social and emotional issues adjusting to a school environment after being isolated for such a long time and the need for special services that may have been delayed. Rest assured, Lakeland will be ready. </span><br><br><span>In terms of the current instruction, teachers and coaches continue to provide new material and expanded opportunities as best as they can under the conditions. The overwhelming response has been positive and understanding, and we continue to try and solve the problems a few individuals or families are experiencing as quickly as we get them. We are in touch with local and statewide networks to ensure we have the most up to date academic information and strategies for success.</span><br><br><span>Our food distribution program has outgrown the George Washington Elementary site. Wednesday, almost 300 cars lined up or parked to receive donations, and we expect even more at the next one, scheduled for May 6th. Thanks to Matthew Slater, Yorktown Supervisor, Chief Noble, and the Jefferson Valley Mall management, we have graciously been allowed to move the event to the Jefferson Valley Mall parking lot. In the next week or two, we will provide all of the details regarding arrangements for the new site.</span><br><br><span>We are still awaiting news on our annual budget and trustee vote. As of now, we know it won't happen until June, but we continue to work on preparing financially for the coming year. Regardless of the date, this will be a very challenging year financially. State aid will be declining, and costs continue to increase. We are closely monitoring our staffing for next year to ensure efficiency while maintaining reasonable class sizes. To prepare the final budget presentation, we are awaiting our first state aid adjustment that will be provided at the end of April.</span><br><br><span>Last evening, the Board accepted the retirement resignations of Marlene Gracia, Assistant Principal at Walter Panas High School and Jo-Anne Ricapito, District Food Service Supervisor. We wish them well in their retirements and thank them for their years of dedicated service.</span><br><br><span>On a personal note, today is Friday, April 17th. As many of you know, I play drums in a band named "Unfunded Mandate." We have been playing for almost ten years, donating all of the proceeds from our shows to the Lakeland Education Foundation, and in turn, to the students and teachers of our district. Tonight was to be one of our final shows before I retired, and just another disappointment for all of us. For those who don't know, our band includes Chris Cummings, Lakeland High School Principal, Rick Russo, Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School Music teacher, Chris Ruggiero, Director of Mathematics, Charles Rhyner, Thomas Jefferson Elementary School Music teacher, Annette Vaccaro, former Music Teacher at Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School, and Dr. Billy Farber Math teacher to many of our graduates and Mercy College teacher. I want to thank all of them for their service, along with everyone else who was part of the band over the years. We had so much fun while serving.

Please know that if you have a power outage for an extended period of time, we do not expect your children to be responsible for assignments during that time, and our staff understands. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">If you have a child in the District who you think needs emotional support, please call the Lakeland Central School District Emotional Support Helpline at 914-603-9089, and we will make necessary connections.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">This leads to my next point. While we are working on developing appropriate exit plans for our seniors, we are also beginning the process of developing re-entry plans for students in grades K-11. This could be this year or next year, but there will be significant work to do. Aside from whatever health and distancing requirements are included, we will also need time to assess student progress, conduct reviews, and ensure that social/emotional needs are met. We will, of course, keep you informed as we make plans.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Some have been asking if spring athletics can take place in the summer and if school can be extended into the summer. Local school districts have no authority to make these decisions. The Governor will decide when we return to school and what will define the school year. State athletics determine when sports will take place, and there are regulations that do not allow for athletic competitions when school is not in session. The short answer probably not likely.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Driver's Ed is another issue for those who were hoping to finish the program this year. District Office is responding to the questions about the program and what the options would be moving forward. Apparently, there will be no more offerings this school year, so students will need to register for the Spring or Fall.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">AP Exams will be held the first two weeks in May, and schools will be sending information to students. Home Access is now open to review course selections. All concerns should be routed to the school for consideration.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">I have also been asked about kindergarten and new student registrations. We continue to register new students online, but we do not yet have dates for kindergarten screenings. Individual schools have been scheduling "virtual" orientations. To start a registration, please contact the school in your attendance zone.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">One of the big unknowns is the status of senior events. It is clear from the feedback that most would like to hold the graduation over until large social gatherings are once again allowed, and our graduations could be "in-person." This would more than likely require alternate venues, as the County Center is booked throughout the year. It certainly may be possible to hold our own, but we do need back-up plans. If we find that our only option would be online graduation, then we would be working with a professional event planner and a professional production company to ensure it is the best it could possibly be. Again it is too early to make that decision, but we have to be prepared either way. We have also received many creative ideas for senior special events; parades, spirit weeks, live yearbooks, etc. All of your ideas have been forwarded to building principals who are meeting with their seniors to consider what would work best for each school. I am hoping by the beginning of May, we can have narrowed the choices and then can start in on the planning.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">I will certainly provide more updates as I have them. Until then, stay well!<br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. George Stone, Superintendent<br>Lakeland Central School District<br></span></span><a href="mailto:gstone@lakelandschools.org" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">gstone@lakelandschools.org</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><br></span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">@Drgeorgestone</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></strong></span></span></span><hr>

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong><strong>Posted April 9, 2020<br>Community Update from Superintendent Dr. Stone <br></strong></strong></strong></span>
<div class="news-desc">
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="Community%20Update%20Superintendent%20Spanish%204-9.pdf" target="_blank">Versión en español haga clic aquí </a><br>We are still working through a number of issues as the year starts to wind down. Crucial to our decision making is the calendar. As so many of you have commented, if we would simply know we were not going to reopen this year, we could make our final plans and move forward. Currently, we continue to explore ideas both ways; one path returning, and one path not returning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">The fourth quarter, third trimester, and final grading are obviously of concern to parents and students. Assuming we do not return, the final quarter or trimester grades will likely be more flexible, using a system such as "meets expectations, exceeds expectations or does not meet expectations." The final grade would reflect the major part of the work for the first three quarters or two trimesters, and then factor in the final work. While the Regents Exams have been waived, students must still pass the Regents courses they are enrolled in or complete the course in summer school.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Assuming we come back (probably not before May 15th or June 1st at the earliest), teachers would at least have some time to assess their students progress, their areas of strengths and weaknesses, and at least assess until the end of the year the effort put into the makeup of loss time and instruction. We would probably still utilize a more flexible final grading system, but at least some whole group time could really provide better data on progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">The budget and school board trustee elections are now on hold until after June 1st. The actual adoption of the budget by the Board is being held after the first State adjustment period, which ends on April 30th. Following this time, our state aid could be reduced significantly, requiring us to make needed adjustments before adoption. Next week, I will be putting together my budget presentation that I would normally give in-person to all building staff and all schools P.T.A. It will be available online for the public to view and provide comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">With schools closed, it is allowing us to get some of our construction projects underway. The Van Cortlandtville connecting corridor will be mobilizing shortly. With asphalt plants reopening, the new Van Cort playground can be paved, and the Lakeland High School field project can be completed. New boilers at Walter Panas will also be complete, and other small summer projects can probably get underway once we know the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Schools continue to look for new and innovative ways to provide instruction, and staff is getting much more comfortable with the new platform. When we return to regular instruction, hopefully, technology will play an expanded role.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Aside from the superintendency, we have a number of positions to fill for the coming year. In order to stay on schedule, we will be interviewing with committees online.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Award ceremonies, moving up ceremonies, graduations, proms, may all need a new format this year. As I meet with other districts, many different ideas are being floated from virtual ceremonies, to fall ceremonies, even some considering as late as October or November. I also recognize seniors are dealing with issues related to the start of post-secondary programs, and whether they will begin semesters on time. As far as high schools are concerned, I think it is important that we hear from the students with any creative ideas they may have for how we can sponsor these events. (Please see below)</span></p>

<div class="news-desc">
<p><span style="color: #000000;" data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="Community%20update%20April%206%20Spanish.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Haga clic para version espanol</span></a><br>Dear Lakeland Community:<br><br>Let me start by hoping everyone is continuing to stay safe and healthy as the days continue to go by. Today, we received some updates from Albany on the remainder of the year. The Governor today extended the closure until April 29th. That could mean returning April 29th or April 30th, depending on how the Executive Order is written. We also learned today that Regents exams will be canceled, and further guidance on graduation standards will be forthcoming. Teacher evaluations tied to Regents Exam results and State Assessment results that have already been canceled, will also be put on hold this year. Our State Aid budget allocations are also still unknown. New language appears to indicate that the Governor will be able to reduce State Aid based upon the loss of revenue for NY State. We will certainly continue to monitor the budget prior to finalizing ours.<br><br>The question we are most frequently asked is how students will be evaluated this year in terms of their school assignments, course credit, promotions, and retentions, etc. As I'm sure you can imagine, this has been made more complicated this year, and as we talk with other districts, it seems as if almost everyone is creating a different process and awaiting further guidance. After a lot of thoughtful discussions, we are able to provide the following information as of now:<br><br><strong>Middle and High School Students Third Quarter Grading <br></strong>For secondary level students, middle and high school, the third quarter began February 3rd. Essentially, normal school work was assigned, collected, and checked from February 3rd through March 10th. The basic third quarter grade, therefore, will be based upon the work completed during that time. From March 11th, until the end of the third quarter, April 17th, we have been operating under a very different set of circumstances. For this period, students will be "held harmless." What that means is no third quarter grade can be negatively affected after March 10th. All work assigned and evaluated from March 11th through April 17th can only help enhance a student's third quarter grade; it cannot hurt the grade. Students going above and beyond, even if they are still handing in assignments for work before March 11th, may be able to improve their final third quarter grade.<br><br><strong>Middle and High School Fourth Quarter and Final Grading</strong><br>At this time, we now know we will be home at least through all of April. We will continue assigning new work and evaluating it as it comes back. As far as how we will conclude the fourth quarter or the final average, we need first to learn whether we will be returning or not. If for some reason, we did return shortly after April 29th (highly unlikely), we would try and return to normal procedures as quickly as possible. However, the final grading is determined; it is our sincere desire not to harm our students for a situation beyond their control. More than likely (but not certain), we will establish a grading policy of "Meets Expectations, Exceeds Expectations or Does Not Meet Expectations" for the fourth quarter. How we determine a final grade still needs further discussion as well. I also want to make sure everyone understands that for the small number of students who may be having difficulty getting or turning in assignments, we have teachers reaching out, support professionals and administrators all making contacts to find out what the problems are and what they can do to help eliminate them and get the students on track. (We are all in this together.) <br><br><strong>Elementary Grading<br></strong>Elementary students finished their second trimester on March 20th, so the third trimester is now underway. While we won't finalize the final elementary plans until we know whether we are going back to school or not, a similar philosophy is in place. We do not want these extreme circumstances to affect their progress negatively, and we won't plan to evaluate in the same way we have assessed in the first two trimesters. I'm sure parents' biggest concerns are the issues of promotion and retention. If teachers were having concerns about promotion prior to this closure, then those are the same students, they will be having conversations with parents and administrators about placements for 2020-2021. Students in good standing prior to the closure will remain that way as we move forward.<br><br>Dr. Gagliardi and her staff will continue to provide updates on academic and instructional programs, Dr. Rappleyea and his staff will continue providing special services, and our other services of food distribution and child care will continue.<br><br><strong>ON A LIGHTER NOTE:</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ATTENTION STUDENT WRITERS AND ARTISTS:<br></span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Don't give up: HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL!

I'm really surprised to hear this, as whoever is there is jeopardizing the time frame for getting back prior to the June celebrations. If students in our district do not understand the significance of congregating in groups, then we will need to take further action. If any community would understand this, I thought for sure it would be Lakeland. As the one responsible for ensuring safety, I am going to say it one more time, stay off the fields. Starting today, Officer Hilliard will be patrolling the campus to ensure compliance. There is no choice in this matter; it has to stop.<br><br>I will be providing more updates as I get them.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Families:                                                                                     </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In an effort to aggressively slow the spread of COVID-19, New York State’s Governor, Andrew Cuomo, has ordered the closure of all schools in the state of New York first through April 1, 2020, and now through the 15th. In addition, there is an indication that schools may be ordered to remain closed for a longer period in an effort to continue social distancing and slow the rate at which this virus spreads. Just last month the Lakeland CSD Special Education Office hosted an open house for our SEPTA parents.  We discussed how it was our intention to schedule “open door Fridays” for parents to come in without an appointment and visit with me if they wished. It is amazing to me how much things have changed in so short a time. Now our doors are closed, and communication opportunities have drastically changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As this crisis has unfolded Dr. Stone has made sure to provide regular updates to parents with what we knew to be happening. Since the State and County executive orders have been issued, we now have clarity on our restrictions. We appreciate the concerns of parents and students, especially those who depend on the delivery of special education instruction, accommodations, supports and related services. This letter contains important information about our plan for implementing special education instruction, providing related services, Committee on Preschool Special Education (CPSE), and Committee on Special Education (CSE) meetings during the extended closures. Administration and staff have been working diligently to develop plans to maintain consistency of special education services.  We are committed to doing our best to address your child's needs remotely, but it is possible that not all typical school-based instruction and special education supports can be feasibly implemented through a distance learning model during the present health crisis. Your patience and understanding is greatly appreciated as we work through the logistics of this challenging time together.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Leading up to this moment, the special education supervisors and myself have been meeting with staff and support staff to prepare as best as we can for this event; first in person, then as this pandemic unfolded, via videoconference.  Special education teachers have prepared resources in the same way that teachers of students without disabilities have. Related services providers have provided web resources for students with disabilities (Find a link here to the<a href="http://www.livebinders.com/play/play?id=2643001"><span style="color: #000000;"> LiveBinder</span></a>) which can also be located on the District Web page. Related services providers have also begun to implement a plan for the provision of web-based support to students at home. We have set up supports for students who need additional food, and we have begun to structure systems to support students in emotional crises.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Please reach out to us regarding any concerns you have relating to the implementation of your child’s special education services and/or accommodations in the weeks ahead. We are here to support you and your children during this challenging time. Thank you for your patience and understanding in working with us as our school community responds to COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have included below a concise description of our service plan along with a link to the New York State Education Department Guidance for Special Education which was released Friday, and a link back to the District website. We miss you and your children and look forward to the day when we can all return safely to school. Please stay in touch, be well, and be safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Yours,<br>Dr. Steve Rappleyea <br></span></p>

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong><strong>Posted March 31, 2020<br><a href="Spanish%20version%20GS%20COMMUNITY%203-31.pdf" target="_blank">Versión en español haga clic aquí</a><br></strong></strong></strong>Dear Lakeland Community:</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We continue to analyze and make sense of the Governor's orders to schools. Our latest understanding is we are required to provide instruction for all days in our calendar that are currently snow emergency days or vacation days, or we will forfeit the State Aid we would receive for each of those days, and possibly all the days of the COVID-19 closures. This would be a devastating financial loss for our district, which I cannot support, so I am doing everything in my power to ensure we are in compliance with these orders.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, teachers will be working and providing assignments daily for all school days moving forward including April 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13, as well as May 22 and May 26, unless another executive order after April 15 changes that.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">My Assistants and I have been reading all of the Facebook and other social media comments, and recognize similar patterns we see in a "normal" school year. Namely, most are very happy with the work being provided, and some feel it is too little or too much. We wish there was a perfect formula to guarantee every teacher was providing every possible strategy that every individual student needs, but again, that is not even possible under normal conditions. One thing I would note, there are many regions of this state and all across the country where technology, access, assignments, and communications are not even close to what we are able to do in this region. It's far from perfect, but it could be considerably worse. Obviously, as teachers continue to share resources, websites, etc. the skill set will continue to grow as well. Finally, some students (mainly at the secondary level) are not responding to teacher requests to "check-in" regularly. If you could encourage your students to respond as requested, that would increase the flow of instruction and communication. Updates to our CoAI plans will be sent out on April 1, 2020. The updates are in purple and under the "Instructional Guidelines" section in both documents. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">I know this is even harder for seniors (students). It is as if their senior year has been taken, and many who know where they are headed next year may have very little interest in what is left of this year. As we say every year, however, "academic gymnastics," namely keeping up with classes and assignments, will be a significant advantage when they are faced with hours and hours of intensive post-secondary work next Fall. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The Board will be meeting Thursday evening (from homes) to discuss the budget and to consider the required legal action on the calendar. Today in the news, it appears NY State may get additional education funds from the federal government, which may help with the coming year deficit. We remain committed to doing everything we can to keep revenues up, costs down, and the levy increase below the tax cap. The public will be able to view the public meeting at 7:00 p.m. Thursday. We will post a link prior to the meeting on our website. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Once again, Feeding Westchester will be at George Washington tomorrow, April 1, beginning at 3:30 p.m. We ask that you wait in cars, or if walking maintain appropriate distances at all times.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">I hope these regular updates help to keep you informed, and hopefully, understanding we are trying our best to do our best. While my retirement looms out there somewhere, for now, this is my reality as well as all of you and will receive my full attention until this year has ended.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Most importantly, I offer my thoughts that those of you who are well and healthy stay that way, and those taking care of or have loved ones who are ill, are blessed with speedy and complete recoveries. Thanks again, health care workers and first responders.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. George Stone, Superintendent<br></span><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span><hr>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Lakeland Community:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As if this cannot get any more complicated or confusing, the Governor has now issued an Executive Order indicating we must work through Spring Recess and all available days until the end of the year, or forfeit the State Aid we would receive for the number of days. Therefore, on Thursday evening, the Board of Education will be asked to approve a resolution returning all available vacation days to the school calendar. In practice, however, we are instructing our teachers to prepare a week's worth of assignments, websites, etc. and distribute to their students on Friday, April 3rd. This will provide students with daily work, but relieve teachers of the burden to provide instruction daily during the following week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I certainly apologize for any confusion this is creating, but given the financial conditions we are currently experiencing and the concerning outlook for the coming year, we cannot afford to lose any State Aid we are entitled. I know our community has offered their support in anyway they can, and this is just another example of our need to work together.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In another order, the Governor has moved the date of school elections back to June 2nd. We are still awaiting clarification as to whether this includes the budget vote. We believe it does, but we do need legal guidance. For now, we will continue to keep the budget process moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I want to once again thank everyone involved in the food distribution and child care programs being conducted as well as our Facilities Department, who is continually cleaning. I also send my heart out to our health care workers and first responders. For parents of student athletes, today, Section One postponed all Spring Sports at least until April 15th.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once again, I apologize for these ongoing changes, but so is the nature of this current crisis. Hopefully, we will bring closure to this before the end of year activities. Until then, be well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>

<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 27, 2020</span></strong><br><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Lakeland Community:</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Today the Governor announced that schools will remain closed through April 15th. Since this takes us through our scheduled Spring Recess, Lakeland Schools will observe our Spring Recess from April 6th through the 13th. The recess will be a time for our teachers and staff to take some time for their families, and will not be required to send assignments during those days. Many I am sure will be in touch, as with limited travel, they may be looking for activities to fill the days, but please understand this will be optional during the recess period.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We will continue our food distribution program, and the Children's Center program for health care workers and first responders will continue except for Thursday, April 9th, and Friday, April 10th, which are official school holidays. Also, Feeding Westchester will provide pre-packaged food for those who need it, Wednesday, April 1st starting at 3:00 p.m. at George Washington Elementary School. Patrons should stay in their cars, and food will be brought to you. If walking to the site, please maintain the social distancing of at least six feet.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">As you may have heard, the Governor has serious concerns about budgets this year. We are working very hard as the Budget Adoption date approaches to find a way to balance our budget and still be able to complete needed work for next year, in particular, the Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School roof. The Van Cortlandtville corridor project, the playground, the Walter Panas Field Project, and mechanical work were already budgeted this year, so all of those projects are continuing. As always, we are working to make sure our tax levy for this year remains under the mandated cap, but we certainly have a lot of work to do.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">As we continue onward, we are trying to keep our Lakeland family in touch. Keep your home photos coming, and the wonderful Walter Panas Gallery One Art Exhibit that was canceled the day before the opening will be presented to you online through our social media sites. I am remaining optimistic about proms and graduations, but regardless of what ultimately happens, we will find a way to celebrate our seniors, I promise you that!</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Enjoy the weekend, wash your hands, keep distance, etc, and try to get some fresh air, we are having such nice weather.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">George Stone, Superintendent</span><br><hr>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Posted March 23, 2020<br>Community Update from Superintendent Dr. Stone</strong></span><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Lakeland Community:<br><br>Although I have few updates today, I will try and answer some of the more frequent questions I am receiving.<br><br><strong>Question</strong>: "Can teachers please try and provide more lessons, video lessons, and additional assignments?<br><strong>Response</strong>: Our teachers are working extremely hard to learn new methods and platforms many had never used before. Combined with all of the challenges they are facing in their own lives and establishing communication within some cases up to 150 students, the task could be overwhelming. Instead, however, we hear stories of successes and enthusiasm as we all try and work through this. Again, your students beyond their classroom teachers with internet capabilities have access to a wide world of educational opportunities. We are all partners in helping them expand their learning and educational opportunities.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question</strong>: "Will the work be graded?"<br><strong>Response</strong>: The guidance on accountability needs to come from the State of New York. We are opposed to trying to assess students on a playing field that is very far from level and believe that there will be waivers forthcoming regarding completion of coursework, requirements for graduation, as well as assessment. As soon as we know something, we will share that with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question</strong>: "You had said we may need to convert Spring Recess and Memorial Day Weekend to instructional days. Is that still the case?"<br><strong>Response</strong>: NO, The required two week closure has been subtracted from our 180 day requirement and therefore, we are still on track for required days. Spring Recess will now be an official school closing just as it would have been before this emergency. We won't know about the need for Memorial Day Weekend, as at this point, it looks like we may be in for an extended closure. As we receive information on this, we will immediately provide it to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question:</strong> "Can't we come by the school and pick up additional items?"<br><strong>Response</strong>: At this time, we are respecting the directives of the Governor and State Ed, restricting residents and students. We currently have only essential personnel on site, and that is only for essential functions. At such time as we are informed, we can provide materials or items we will establish protocols for pick up or delivery, but at this time, as our sign out front says, "Beat the Spread, Stay Home."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Question</strong>: Will events such as proms, graduations, moving up ceremonies, the budget vote, and board election all scheduled for later this Spring take place?<br><strong>Response</strong>: There is simply no way of knowing at this point. What we do know is that the more people respect and adhere to the distancing requirements, the slower this will spread, and the sooner it can be extinguished. So if these activities are important, please do your parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Beyond this, I hope you continue to stay well, and we hope to have more definitive guidance from the Department of Education later this week.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">College Board Parent Letter from Lakeland High School Principal Chris Cummings and</span></strong><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Walter Panas High School Principal Joseph Sper</strong>o</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Lakeland High School and Walter Panas High School Families:<br><br>Throughout this school year, students have worked diligently in their Advanced Placement courses. As we navigate through the uncharted events regarding COVID-19, we are working to keep everyone updated with the latest information and status of culminating exams. On March 20th CollegeBoard shared information regarding the administration of these exams.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Please carefully read the key points below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Traditional face-to-face exam administrations will not take place.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- There will be two different testing dates for students to choose from.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Those dates will be available near April 3rd.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Tests will be 45 minutes in length and students will be able to take these streamlined exams on any device they have access to—computer, tablet, or smartphone. Taking a photo of handwritten work will also be an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Material assessed will only consist of the material taught up until March of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Colleges support this solution and are committed to ensuring that AP students receive the credit they have worked this year to earn. For decades, colleges have accepted a shortened AP Exam for college credit when groups of students have experienced emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Should a student want to cancel their exam, they can do so with no penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Test security is also a concern which the College Board is addressing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- The exam questions are designed and administered in ways that prevent cheating; we use a range of digital security tools and techniques, including plagiarism detection software, to protect the integrity of the exams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- Scoring at-home work for an AP Exam is not new to the AP Program. For years the AP Program has received and scored at-home student work as part of the exams for the AP Computer Science Principles and AP Capstone courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we continue to receive information regarding these exams, we will support our students and families by providing the necessary information to assist in your decision making. As educational leaders will continuously provide the necessary information to guide making these academic decisions during this uncertain time.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Posted March 20, 2020</strong><br><strong>Community Update</strong><br><br>Dear Lakeland Community,</span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we close out the week, my first thoughts are with you and your families, hoping that all is well. If anything good can come out of this, I know from an educational standpoint, we are exploring and learning new ways to communicate and share information with our students that can help us long after this crisis is a distant memory. Our Lakeland Central School District instructional staff has done a truly remarkable job getting these new strategies started. Every day they are learning new and innovative ways to improve the continuity of academic instruction. We are also doing our best to continue providing support services for our special need students, as well as guidance services for our secondary students. Next week we will be exploring ways to help support the social and emotional needs that are arising from working our way through this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our Facilities Department continues to disinfect and sanitize, Food Service is providing approximately 200 breakfasts and 200 lunches daily. As we speak we are working on establishing child care services that our health care providers and first responders may need. We should have better information ready to go early next week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Last evening, the Board passed resolutions to ensure our employees who typically are not paid during closures will continue to receive needed income. They will continue to provide services for us, as requested. The Board also fulfilled its legal obligations in terms of posting notices for the upcoming school budget and election and discussed at length how we can be fiscally responsible to the public while still accomplishing all of the goals we have set for the future. The Board expressed their concerns for how difficult a time this is for so many families. I should also add that the Board of Education insisted on setting a good example for the community, practicing appropriate social distancing, and respecting the recommendation for no more than ten at a gathering. Some Board members attended the meeting through videoconferencing and while the public was prohibited from attending, the meeting was live streamed for anyone to view.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As time goes on, we will try and give more and more support, looking for and sharing new ways to improve the communication and information between our schools and our homes. I know how difficult this is for all, as I hear from many of you each day, dealing with both unique and common challenges. I know you count on us to help get everyone through this, and I assure you we are doing our best. I have never seen so many so willing to pitch in and help in any way they can.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I'm not sure if we are in the eye of this storm yet, but depending on how vigilant we are in following the directives, we can hopefully shorten the total duration. While I don't know what the short term future looks like, I do know that the long term future for Lakeland is bright, prosperous, and filled with great promise. Keep the faith!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As I have said on many occasions, please feel free to contact me with your concerns, questions, thoughts, and ideas. So much of what I offer others comes from all of you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Have a great weekend!</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 19, 2020</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Message from Assistant Superintendent of Instruction Dr. Gagliardi</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Lakeland Families,<br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">During the time that our schools are closed, LCSD is committed to providing continuity of learning for our students. Given the nature of the challenges our country is currently facing, we think it is important that our students maintain relationships with their teachers, their schools, with one another, and with their families. As always, we are committed to the academic, physical, and mental health of our students.<br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Our aspiration with continuity of academic instruction would be consistent with our high expectations for our learning community. Our commitment is that teachers will make every effort to provide students with activities that are relevant, authentic, and engaging. It is not our expectation, however, that the continuity of academic instruction can be the same as classroom learning. We ask all our families to understand that this model is new for us, there will be initial glitches, and our skills will grow with time. In light of our commitment to the social emotional wellness of our students, we do not believe in a model that has students in front of screens for the length of a regular school day. Teachers will be in touch with their students on a daily basis, providing learning activities, checking-in, and answering questions.<br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">The continuity of instruction began on March 18 and will continue every school day for as long as our schools are closed. Depending on the length of the closure, it is likely that the models our teachers use will evolve. As we continue to think through how best to provide learning for our students in these most unusual times, some of the guidelines in this document may change, as well. Be assured that we will communicate with you if and when there are any such changes.<br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Please remember that nothing is more important than the health and well-being of our students, staff, and the broader community. With that in mind, I encourage all to find time for self and family. Do not let school work, or any single activity, become all-consuming. Seek the healthiest balance in life as we continue to deal with many unknowns.<br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">We hope the information will be helpful to our students and our families. Please never hesitate to reach out to us with your questions. <br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">With sincere regards,</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Karen Gagliardi</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Assistant Superintendent of Instruction</span><br><hr>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">While we understand how closed in people are feeling and that fresh air can be helpful, this cannot take place on school fields at this time. Schools have been closed by executive order, and that includes our fields as well. Please walk around your neighborhood, ride bikes but do not plan to congregate at the schools. Starting in the next day or two construction will start back up at Lakeland High School and this is another reason we must prohibit pedestrian traffic. The grounds will be posted as they are after hours. I regret deeply having to make these announcements as I know we all love being outside, and I know how much our students miss seeing with their friends. But the directives have been issued, and we all need to respect them. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">George Stone Superintendent</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 16, 2020<br></span><span style="color: #000000;">COMMUNITY UPDATE</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As many of you have probably heard by now, all New York State schools, including the Lakeland Central School District, will be closed at least through March 31, 2020. While this is by Executive Order, it appears that we must still utilize all remaining vacation days as part of the school calendar requirement for days in session regulations. As of now, although it is extremely unlikely, we will start back to school before the scheduled Spring Recess from April 6 through April 13. Should schools reopen, we will be in session through Spring Recess and Memorial Day weekend (excluding the scheduled holidays of Holy Thursday (April 9), Good Friday (April 10), and Memorial Day (May 25).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Tomorrow, we will begin our food distribution program to families in need across the District. Our Food Service Department has contacted needy families to make arrangements for obtaining meals.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have received numerous requests from students and staff wanting to pick up materials, musical instruments, Chrome Books, etc. Principals under the direction of our Assistant Superintendent of Instruction have developed a schedule to allow this to take place on Wednesday, March 18, so that everyone can get what they need for this uncertain closure. These schedules will be posted on our website, communicated through social media, and e-blasted to all families.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have also been requested to provide child care classroom space and staffing for first responders and health care providers in our District. We plan to establish these classrooms at Van Cortlandtville Elementary School, and shortly will have a posting with contact information. If you are a first responder or health care provider in need of this service, please contact our Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, Dr. Tammy Cosgrove, at tcosgrove@lakelandschools.org </span><span style="color: #000000;">The hours will be tentatively 8:00 am to 6:00 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As far as our Continuity of Academic Instruction Plan, teachers will begin communicating daily with their students starting Wednesday, March 18. For those with internet access, Chrome Books and other devices with Google can be used. For those who do not have internet access, teachers will be creating packets, and arrangements will be made for pick up. Grading, report cards, State Testing, Regents, and AP Exams are all on hold at this time, awaiting further guidance from the State. For now, we want to get students into the practice of working constructively and enriching the work they were doing prior to this closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Board of Education will continue to hold scheduled meetings to ensure legal and procedural requirements are met. There will be no special presentations, only the regular business of the Board. The Board invites the public to email questions you would like to have answered to the District Clerk. Your email must include your name and address, just as a speaker must do when addressing the Board in Public Participation. We will do our best to either cover them in the public meeting or get back to you with a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I hope this information is helpful to you, and we will continue to provide you updates as we have them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Posted March 15, 2020</strong><br><br></span><span style="color: #000000;">Lakeland Community:<br><br></span><span style="color: #000000;">While you begin making alternative plans from your normal routines, Lakeland Administration continues to make plans to find ways to better help you. Tomorrow (March 15) morning I will be meeting with my Cabinet, our Board Officers and our Principals to discuss where we are and where we intend to go. We also expect to hear from Westchester County Executive Lattimer who indicated on the radio Friday he will be extending the closure indefinitely. In addition, the Governor is taking similar action.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Information on the specific dates of closure will come tomorrow. We want to hear the official announcements first. Obviously this looks like an extended closing is possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are a number of issues we are working on. While I wish I could give you health information, we are rapidly moving beyond that. As another superintendent has noted, the health departments seem to be assuming as one family member tests positive, the entire family may have it or will remain quarantined 14 days, so they are not even testing the rest of the family. The best I can recommend in this regard is if your family seems well, keep practicing good health practices, but also encourage your children (especially young adults) not to go out doing the things they normally do when they are not in school. Teens think they are invincible, but even if they don’t develop a serious case, they are also potential carriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We will be working very hard on academic plans. Other districts are starting to set up cloud based learning networks that we all may be able to plug into. Dr. Gagliardi is working with principals, curriculum directors and lead teachers to keep these programs moving forward. I know with kids looking for things to do “it can’t be fast enough!” but rest assured she is working on this 24/7.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We will also be discussing food distribution, continual cleaning and maintenance, the school calendars and vacations, ways we can help our working staff that normally lose wages during these conditions, how to help child care and nursery school centers, state testing and other upcoming major school events, how we continue school board business, and probably a million other topics, so stay tuned.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once again, every day, I will tell you as much as I can, and try to solve as many problems as I can. Please, most of your school children have learned “Mindfulness” and other stress relieving activities, take part of the day to practice this with them. It will help keep all of you less stressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Stay Well!</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 14, 2020</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rumors are continuing to spread about students testing positive for COVID-19. As of this posting Saturday, March 14, 2020, the Lakeland Central School District has no students or staff confirmed with a positive test for the COVID-19.<br></span><br><span style="color: #000000;">If we know of a confirmed case, we will let the community know as soon as possible. I understand everyone is worried. We would appreciate your assistance in helping minimize anxiety by waiting for official announcements.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you for your continued support.</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 13, 2020<br></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Lakeland Community,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Over the past few days, I have provided you with as much information as I have regarding the emergency situation we face. In addition, I tried and will continue to answer your questions as I receive them. One question is, why we might need to eliminate Spring Recess since students may be working electronically from home. Our attempt to provide electronic communication between the schools and the homes is to help students keep working. However, there is no legal allowance to use these days as part of our required 180 days. That type of waiver can only come from legislation and the Governor. There is proposed legislation to excuse any closure days due to COVID-19. Today (March 13), the Governor indicated there would be some type of waiver and we have been advised to ensure that all remaining emergency closing and vacation days are available to meet the 180 day requirement. We have two emergency days left and one additional conference day that can also be converted to a school day. Please understand that while health and safety are our number one concerns, State Aid accounts for about twenty-five percent of our budget and is critical to our programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This morning, more than 50 superintendents and 20 others were on a video chat, with the Acting Commissioner of the New York State Education Department, and NY State Senate Head of the Education Committee, and the Chancellor of the Board of Regents, to discuss the COVID-19 and the impact on our schools. In all respective communities, there was a deep collective concern for the safety of our students, staff, and community. In light of these concerns, the Lakeland Central School District, along with all districts in our region, will be using two emergency closure days and again be closed on Monday, March 16, and Tuesday, March 17. At this time, there are still many unanswered questions for school districts; as they relate to the potential spread of COVID-19 within our schools and the logistical and fiscal implications on schools. As I noted above, this will mean we are out of available emergency days, so again we hope the Governor and the Legislature will provide waivers on the 180 day requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I hope we can obtain answers to our questions during this temporary closure and receive more concrete guidance from the Governor, the State Education Department, and the county and state health departments. However, if we cannot assure the health and safety of our students, staff, and community, we are prepared to extend the closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As I have previously noted, we completely understand the hardships that school closures place on our families. I know many will be upset, and many will understand the decision to close schools on March 16 and 17. This is not an easy situation for us, many staff members and students are considered part of the vulnerable population to COVID-19 or maybe positive with no symptoms; the only reasonable option is to protect our students and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have received the approval of our application to provide meals to families in our community. Early next week, we will be discussing a distribution plan, and hopefully, this can help our families in some small way. I hope all questions about the SAT exams have been answered, but if you still have remaining questions, please email the high school principals who are handling these matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Over the weekend, as I receive additional information, I will share it as quickly as possible. For now, once again, please be safe and stay well.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 12, 2020</span></strong><br><span style="color: #000000;">Lakeland Central School District has been in contact with the College Board regarding the cancellation of the SAT test at Walter Panas High School on Saturday, March 14. The College Board will contact families about rescheduling or refunds.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 12, 2020</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Update for Thursday, March 12, 2020</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lakeland Community:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We continue to work around the clock to get answers and needed testing from Westchester County and NY State Health Departments. While we are hopeful to open schools on Monday, March 16, that decision cannot be made at this time. I apologize to our families struggling with child care coverage, and financial concerns, my heart goes out to everyone, but health concerns are the current number one priority.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We understand that many of our families depend on the school breakfast and lunch given to their child, so our Food Service Supervisor has applied to the NY State to allow us to provide these meals. As soon as it is approved, we will make a plan for meal distribution as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In a conference I attended today, I received information related to school matters. Most importantly, please note that the Health Department did not authorize the days we are currently closed. Still, our Chief Medical Officer strongly recommended it based upon facts and out of an abundance of caution. At this time, there is no State waiver or action on these days, and we are being advised to make sure we have snow make up days and vacation days available. Therefore, please do not make vacation plans for Spring Break. If we are required to close indefinitely, we may have to add these days to the school calendar.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are still awaiting further direction on state assessment testing, which is scheduled to begin March 25, and on Regents testing and required seat time. I will, of course, keep you posted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Also, out of an abundance of caution, we will be moving the location of our Board of Education Business meeting scheduled for next Thursday, March 19, 2020, at 7:30 to the District Office Board Room. The Board has pressing budget matters that must be approved by law based upon a specific timeline. The meeting will NOT be held at Lakeland High School as initially scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the schools and administration building, We have been utilizing large sanitizing and disinfectant machines. We have cleaned the entire district, so if we are able to open schools, rest assured everything has been thoroughly disinfected and sanitized.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once again, every day, I will be working around the clock to ensure we are doing everything we can for the community, and communicating as frequently as I have information. For now, stay well.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 11, 2020<br></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Saturday March 14's SAT exam at Walter Panas High School has been canceled. We are discussing possible alternative dates</span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 11, 2020</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">A MESSAGE FROM SUPERINTENDENT DR. GEORGE STONE</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Dear Lakeland Community:</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">As we await further testing of COVID-19 exposures, I need to inform you that again “out of an abundance of caution,” all Lakeland Schools will remain closed tomorrow, Thursday, March 12, 2020. Friday, March 13, will remain a Superintendent’s Conference Day, however our teachers will be working from home, and all after school and other activities will be canceled at least through this weekend. We are also trying to identify an alternate location for Saturday (March 14) SAT Exams scheduled for Walter Panas, and will update you as we can.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To bring you up to speed on the COVID-19 health issues, we are diligently trying to get further testing completed for family members of an individual in the community who has tested positive. Our Chief Medical Officer advises that due to the time that has elapsed in identifying the positive result and the fact that we are still awaiting further testing, we need to take these precautionary measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As I have noted earlier, we are in communication with County and State Health Officials, the State Department of Education, and the Governor’s Office. Our Yorktown Supervisor Matthew Slater has been extremely helpful in making necessary emergency contacts as we seek immediate action.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We appreciate the cooperation and support of our community as we try and work through this. Should the new tests come back negative, we could reopen shortly. Should the new tests be positive, we may be looking at an extended closing. These decisions will ultimately be made with direction from Westchester County and State Health Departments.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Regardless, keep washing your hands and face, avoid others with flu-like symptoms, and if you are experiencing symptoms please seek medical assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We will continue to keep you updated as new information arises.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 10, 2020<br></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Out of an abundance of caution, all Lakeland Schools will be closed tomorrow, Wednesday, March 11, 2020. While we do not have a confirmed case in our district (student or staff), we have been advised to close because of a direct connection. While we are closed tomorrow, we will be scrubbing and sanitizing all buildings and all buses. Hopefully, we will be able to reopen shortly. I will provide more details as I have them tomorrow.</span><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span><span style="color: #000000;">George Stone, Superintendent</span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 10, 2020<br>From the Superintendent:  COVID-19 Lakeland Updates<br></span></strong></p>
<p>I<span style="color: #000000;">n a meeting yesterday with the County Executive, we learned that the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and NY State Department of Education (NYSED) would issue guidelines for school districts. The County Health Department would assist and make recommendations, but official guidance would come from the State. Later in the day, we learned the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If we have a confirmed case of COVID-19, the school will be required to close for an initial 24 hour period, to begin an investigation to determine the contacts that person may have had in the school. The investigation will determine any further closing or quarantines recommended by the local health department. During that initial 24 hour period, the school will clean and disinfect the building. Again the closure is required one day but maybe longer if the County recommends, and the State agrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Currently, we have members of the school community who have been tested, but as of this morning, we still have no confirmed cases. If and when we do have a confirmed case, that school community will be notified through all means necessary, including an all-call to inform of the initial closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We understand that emergency closures are a major disruption to working families, but we want you to know these closures will be required by the State, and we will, of course, comply, clean and disinfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have been asked about the cleaning of buses. We have been scrubbing buses a number of times each week. With the new disinfecting machines arriving, we will be able to disinfect the entire fleet every day in a matter of a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If a student or staff member comes to school and is exhibiting flu-like symptoms or becomes ill during the school day, they will be isolated and sent home as soon as a contact person arrives. The County and State Health Departments will be notified for follow up and testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We appreciate the cooperation of our school community and how members have contacted us for voluntary quarantine and management of their condition. I also want to give a major deal of gratitude to our District Physician, Head Nurse, and nurses in all buildings for their hard work, professionalism, and commitment to our health and safety. We are blessed to have such amazing people, and they have been in contact around the clock every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I now have daily morning briefings from the County, and I will continue to keep you updated as I receive additional information. Thank you, and have a great day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 9, 2020<br></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Please disregard any rumors you are hearing or reading regarding the COVID-19/ coronavirus at Walter Panas High School this morning (March 9). They are false. Any updates will come directly from the school or district. Thank you.<br></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 9, 2020<br></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Superintendent Dr. Stone: Update COVID-19</strong> </span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Lakeland Community:</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">I know everyone is hoping for a perfect answer to the growing concerns about the , and unfortunately, there is not. With all situations we face and decisions that need to be made, we continue to place the health and safety of everyone as our number one priority, balanced with a common sense approach that won’t force us to act or react out of fear of the unknown. While COVID-19 is a serious public health threat, I listened to a panel of virus experts most of the day Sunday that indicated this may affect our public in very much the same way as other strains of influenza, and we should do our best to remain calm.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">I am in constant communication daily with our Head Nurse, our District Physician, our Director of Facilities, our regional superintendents, the local and state health departments, State Education and the Governor’s representatives. Friday, I had two conferences, yesterday another conference was held, and this morning I am attending another conference with county and state officials.<br><br></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Decisions to be made regarding the testing or quarantine of students and their family members continues to be guided by the county and state health departments. Should positive test cases arise and we are advised to close, the health departments will assess the risks and determine whether we should close just an individual school site or the entire district. All of these recommendations are based upon their guidelines for the spread of this infection, and the proximity between exposures.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">I have been asked about cleaning and sanitizing. Our facilities staff have been directed to clean and sanitize all areas daily and on weekends. As you can imagine, cleaning supplies are being ordered repeatedly to help ensure supply, and we have purchased large sanitizing machines that can do all areas of the schools very quickly using the best, most state of the art cleaning products available. With all of that being implemented, it won’t stop direct close contact between individuals, and as we have seen in other areas, the need to close may still arise. Whether we are to remain closed for an extended quarantine period, or only a few days for cleaning and sanitizing, those decisions again, will be guided by the health departments and our District Physician.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Should we be forced to close, our curriculum, instruction, and technology departments have been working with teachers to establish communication between the home and school. While we will not be able to provide daily lesson plans for every class, teachers will be able to provide general objectives or assignments, challenge problems, and direct students to practice and enrichment websites. I know parents of students with special needs are particularly concerned, and here again, staff will be in communication as well.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">As you have seen we are selectively postponing large group events. The reason we have not postponed all events is to allow small groups such as teams practicing, or clubs that may want to meet to continue for the time being. Spending some time with friends or a small group may help reduce the anxiety, stress or fear that our young people are most likely experiencing. Hopefully, we can help them to understand that this is another influenza that one day shall pass and we will all return to normalcy.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Please know we are monitoring questions, concerns, and situations continually every day. As we get new information, you will get new information. Once again, I urge everyone to try and remain calm. These complicated matters require all of us to work collectively, and as I have come to learn over the years, the Lakeland community will pull together in tough times, offer help in any way necessary, and get through this together.</span></div>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Posted March 8, 2020<br></strong>Tomorrow, Monday, March 9, 2020, we will provide the school community with updated information on COVID-19/Coronavirus. We clean and sanitize our schools daily. We have no confirmed cases and will be open tomorrow. Our updates will be informational in nature.<strong><br></strong></span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Posted March 6, 2020</strong><br>Rumors are circulating about a Coronavirus case in Lakeland Central School District. These are false. There is no confirmed cases in our District and no students have been quarantined.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">George Stone, Superintendent</span></p>

<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted March 2, 2020</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Guidance and Resources </span></strong><br><span style="color: #000000;">A new coronavirus called 2019 Novel (new) Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This virus had not been found in humans before. This coronavirus can lead to fever, cough and trouble breathing or shortness of breath. There are thousands of diagnosed cases in China and new cases being diagnosed in a number of countries including the United States. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">What do we know? </span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Since this virus is very new, health authorities continue to carefully watch how this virus spreads. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working hard to learn as much as possible about this new virus, so that we can better understand how it spreads and causes illness. The CDC considers this virus to be a serious public health concern. Based on current information the CDC recommends avoiding travel to China. Updated travel information related to 2019-nCoV can be found at </span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china" target="_blank">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china </a><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">How Does 2019 Novel (New) Coronavirus Spread? </span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Health experts believe the virus probably spreads from animals to humans and from person to person. It’s not clear yet how easily the virus spreads from person-to-person. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not currently a concern for the general public and is not actively circulating among New Yorkers at this time. Therefore, there is no need to cancel school or social events, and there is no need for students or school staff to wear surgical masks at school. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Prevention </span><br><span style="color: #000000;">There are currently no vaccines available to protect against this virus. The New York State Department of Health (DOH) recommends the following ways to minimize the spread of all respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV: </span><br><br><ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol- based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Stay home when you are sick.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">CDC recommends that travelers avoid all travel to China.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms </span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Information to date suggests that 2019-nCoV causes mild-to-moderate illness and symptoms like the flu, including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Are visitors from China being screened? </span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, as of February 2nd new screening protocols are conducted for individuals entering the US from China at designated airports. PreK-12 schools may have students who attend school and have traveled to various areas in Asia, including China. Students should not be excluded from school or any school activities based on race, country of origin, or recent travel (or a family member’s recent travel), including to any part of China. Schools may only exclude a student if a local health department informs the school that a student must comply with a quarantine order or the student is symptomatic of a communicable or infectious disease pursuant to Education Law §906. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Important Health Information for Those Who Have Recently Traveled to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and Experience Symptoms </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">If you recently traveled to Wuhan, China and feel sick with fever, cough or trouble breathing; OR you develop symptoms within 14 days of traveling there, you should: </span><br><br><ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Seek medical care right away. Call ahead and tell them about your travel and symptoms.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Avoid contact with others.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Stay home, except for seeking medical care.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Wash hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Contact your local health department.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;">This is an emerging, rapidly changing situation. For questions please contact your local department of health or the NYS DOH Novel Coronavirus hotline at 1-888-364-3065. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We encourage you to keep up to date about 2019-nCoV, its treatment and prevention by visiting the following websites: </span><br><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Additional Resources</span></strong><br><h1><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources-and-podcasts/school-climate-safety-and-crisis/health-crisis-resources/talking-to-children-about-covid-19-(coronavirus)-a-parent-resource" target="_blank">NASP Talking to Children About COVID-19 (Coronavirus): A Parent Resource</a></span></h1>

<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted February 28, 2020</span></strong><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Lakeland Schools COVID-19 Virus Update</strong> </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We are all trying to learn as much as we can about the Covit 19/ Corona virus outbreak and its potential impact on our school and family lives.</span>
</div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">We will be providing weekly updates on what we are learning from the Department of Health, Department of Mental Health, the CDC and other authorities.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Yesterday we participated in a webinar sponsored by the Department of Health for a formal briefing. The Department of Health describes the current status of the Covit 19/ Corona virus outbreak as in a person to person transmission status where the focus is on containment. This focus means health officials are working to detect, track, and isolate cases.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">The webinar also focused on the impact of the outbreak on the healthcare system and its capacity to address the crisis should the spread of the disease change from a person to person transmission to a community wide transmission. The experts on the webinar emphasized that this is a dynamic situation with the CDC issuing updates multiple times a day.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">As with SARS, MRSA and H1N1 outbreaks, all decisions regarding public health will be made by the Department of Health, guided by the CDC. The clear advice from health officials is a firm recommendation that if you feel sick, stay home.</span></div>

<div><span style="color: #000000;">Area School Districts</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Yesterday at a meeting of area school superintendents the potential impacts of this outbreak on our schools and programs were discussed. School field trips, large group gatherings and the delivery of instruction may possibly be impacted in the future. Those decisions will be guided by the Department of Health.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Our Buildings</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">A month ago we aggressively stepped up our cleaning procedures in an attempt to contain the spread of the flu. These efforts obviously will continue. We are also grateful for the great work our nurses are doing with children and their families during this challenging time.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Posted February 27, 2020</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Concerns Over Viral Illnesses Circulating Throughout the World</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We know there are concerns over the many viral illnesses circulating throughout the world. While influenza continues to be the most prevalent viral illness locally, the fears of the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) are certainly understandable.  </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">At this time, there are no confirmed cases in the region. However, the district has communication with our District’s Medical Director, the Westchester and Putnam County Departments of Health, and the New York State Department of Health to ensure that we have the latest information and guidance on illnesses that could potentially affect our schools. We strictly follow the guidance that each entity provides to us so that we may create the safest and healthiest environment possible for our students.     </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">As a school district, we have taken some of the most proactive and thorough measures to combat the flu and other viral illnesses. These measures are proactively enacted each year around the beginning of the influenza season in our district to minimize the impact of the flu and other viral illnesses on our school community. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Recently, the district purchased high-tech disinfecting machines to helps us disinfect in all areas of the school buildings.</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #000000;">All of our classrooms, offices, large-group spaces, the nurse’s office, and bathrooms of our schools are disinfected nightly. We will continue to do this.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Student daily attendance is being monitored, by homeroom and school, to determine if additional disinfection resources need to be deployed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After a rise in absences in early February, across all of our schools, our attendance data have returned to more modest and normal levels.   </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We are pleased to be able to provide this most stringent disinfection schedule to our students and staff in a safe and cost-effective manner; however, the effectiveness of our efforts is maximized when we have full cooperation from our parent community. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We ask that if your child is ill with a fever and/or cough, the child stays out of school. The child should remain home until fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications.  </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">We want to remind our school community about the importance of thorough hand washing with soap and water.  They universally agreed that thorough hand washing was the most effective step to curtail the spread of viral illnesses. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Always know that the health and safety of our students and staff is and will always be our highest priority. We will continue to provide the most comprehensive cleaning and disinfection schedule, and we will promptly communicate any additional relevant information that we learn.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Resources</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">NYS Department of Health-</span><a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/" target="_blank">https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/</a> <br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a></p>
