<p><br></p>
<p>CSD17 Students, Families, and Staff,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Congratulations on completing another week of e-learning!  It seems our students and staff are getting stronger each week and attendance continues to show at over 96%.  It is hard to believe, but we started e-learning over six weeks ago and now just five weeks of school remain; you have made it over the halfway point and we are so proud of you!</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, we will be providing information on how student items currently located in the schools will be returned to students.  Similarly, we will need to collect some items from our students including library books, textbooks, etc.  The team is working on a plan for mid to late May that ensures the safety and health of our staff and students. Thank you for your patience as we work on the details.</p>
<p>Please see below for additional important information:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Staff Professional Development Dates: 

The following dates are designated Staff Professional Development Dates:Friday, May 1; Friday, May 8; and Friday, May 15.  There will be no e-learning on these dates; however, 'Grab and Go' lunches will be available all week including Friday.</strong></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Channahon Family Friday Check-In: Thank you for sharing your family's status with us. This survey has allowed us to check on families and offer support where it is needed.

<ul><li><strong>Grab and Go Lunches: 'Grab and Go' lunch service is offered Monday-Friday.

This service is designed to provide support to those students who could use lunch at this difficult time. Simply drive up to the front entrance of Channahon Junior High between 11:00-11:30 and a team member will bring the lunches directly to your car. If you do not have transportation, please indicate that on the Google Form and we will deliver it to your home.</strong></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Community Resources: We have been made aware of several community resources available to help people through this difficult time:</strong></li></ul>

Individuals who want to speak with a mental health professional can text the word “TALK” or “HABLAR” (for Spanish speakers) to 552-020. Within 24 hours, that individual will receive a call from a mental health professional employed by a local community health center. People can also text other terms, like “unemployment” or “food” or “shelter” to the same number to receive information on how to navigate and access supports and services.

<p>April 17, 2020 (Second Letter)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CSD17 Students, Families, and Staff,<br></p>
<p>At approximately 2:35pm on Friday, April 17, Governor Pritzker made the announcement that schools will remain closed to in-person instruction for the remainder of the school year to prevent the spread of COVID-19.    </p>
<p>This is not the news we wanted to hear. However, we will prevail through a positive attitude and a commitment to providing a high-quality education to every child through the end of the school year.  Furthermore, we will be working to understand how this will impact end-of-year ceremonies including graduation and will communicate information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, we thank you again for your support and encouragement!  We are truly in this together.</p>
<p>Dr. Nicholas Henkle</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>CSD17 Students, Families, and Staff,</p>
<p>I want to open this week's letter by thanking our students and families for your incredible patience and perseverance as we look ahead to when face-to-face learning can resume. Our team sincerely misses our students and we all look forward to a happy reunion, whenever that may be.  We remain impressed that our students continue to show up and put forth outstanding effort each and every day.  Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>We also want to thank our parents and guardians for your incredible encouragement.  Each week, as we review the results of the 'Friday Family Check-In', we are grateful for the kind words and positive comments that you share.  It means a great deal to all of us and provides inspiration to our team.   </p>
<p>You may have watched President Trump's press conference on his three-phase plan to re-open the country.  The speed of that reopening is left to each State Governor.  In Illinois, that decision will be made by Governor Pritzker, who recently indicated that he will be making a decision about a possible school-closure extension within the next week.  I expect we will have an update for you by next Friday.  </p>
<p><strong>Please see below for additional important information:</strong></p>

<p>CSD17 Students, Families, and Staff,</p>
<p>Let me begin by wishing a very happy Easter to those of you who will be celebrating this weekend! As a reminder, there will be no e-learning on Friday, April 10 or Monday, April 13.  'Grab and Go' lunches will <strong><u>not</u></strong> be available on Friday, April 10; however, they <strong><u>will</u> </strong>be available on Monday, April 13, which is a staff professional development day.   E-learning for students will resume on Tuesday, April 14.</p>
<p>Students, I know I speak for the entire team when I say that we have truly enjoyed seeing so many of your faces on <i>Google 'Meet'</i> and <i>'Zoom'</i> and continue to be impressed with your commitment to learning!  We want each of you to know that we miss you and we truly wish we could be with you in school.  Continue to do your best each and every day!  We have seven weeks of school remaining and we are committed to putting in 100% until the very end, regardless of whether we continue e-learning or resume classes in our schools. <br><br></p>

<p>Dear CSD17 Families:</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued e-learning efforts!  Now that we are in week two of this process, we would appreciate your feedback.  The link to the survey below is designed to help us assess the program provided for K-8 students. </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-p8vRWM4-UGn2-Imwss0-40utuvoV1lw0bTwqKsOJIq7l-A/viewform?usp=sf_link">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-p8vRWM4-UGn2-Imwss0-40utuvoV1lw0bTwqKsOJIq7l-A/viewform?usp=sf_link<br></a></p>
<p><br>As you know, this extended remote learning experience is new for all public school districts in Illinois; our committed team is working hard to give students whatever they need.   We understand that this is a stressful time for everyone.  We appreciate the flexibility needed in this situation and want to be as supportive to you and your family as we can during these days. Our main goal is to provide continued meaningful learning opportunities, social-emotional support,  and make nutritious meals available to those students who would benefit from a daily lunch.   </p>
<p><br>If you have any questions please connect with your teachers and school staff - we will help you through this!  </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. Nicholas M. Henkle</p>

<p>March 31, 2020</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear CSD17 Parents and Community Members:</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you and your families safe and well.  Today, Illinois Governor Pritzker announced that remote learning in Illinois will be extended through April 30 in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19.  This follows President Trump's social distancing guidelines, which were established this weekend.  </p>
<p>During this time, on-site learning will remain suspended.  However, our schools’ commitment to a high-quality education for every student has not changed.  All students are expected to attend school throughout this closure.  Please be aware that the days missed before spring break, which were previously labeled with an 'Act of God' designation, will now count towards the total of 176 attendance days.   The final student attendance day remains Friday, May 29. </p>
<p>One of the components of the Governor's order is the ability of school districts to designate days for 'remote learning planning'.  Our team will work to reflect on our e-learning plan and work together to prepare for the coming days and weeks.  Students will not participate in e-learning on these days:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Monday, April 13</li>
<li>Friday, April 24</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the closure extend beyond April 30, additional remote learning planning days will be added to the calendar in May.  </p>
<p>While this closure is not ideal, we want to assure you that the Channahon 17 team will remain fully engaged and committed to your children.  We also expect students to remain engaged and committed to their own education.  I want to thank you for your patience and understanding as we face this unprecedented situation together. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. Nicholas M. Henkle</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Dear CSD17 Students and Families,</p>
<p>We hope everyone has enjoyed a safe and healthy spring break! As the week comes to a close, we look forward to reuniting with students via e-learning on Monday.  We are proud to share that in our first three days of e-learning, we achieved over 96% attendance as a school community!  We thank you, students and parents, for your commitment to education and credit each of you, as well as our committed team, for this success. We look forward to building on this momentum come Monday.  </p>

<p><em>Dear Channahon 17 Students, Staff &amp; Community Members,</em></p>
<p><em>As you may have heard, Governor Pritzker has ordered state residents not involved in “essential” activities to stay home for at least two weeks beginning on Saturday, March 21 at 5:00pm.  This order includes the closure of schools through April 7.  Therefore, e-learning will resume on Monday, March 30 and continue through at least Tuesday, April 7. School is expected to resume on April 8; however, that date is subject to change.  <br></em></p>
<p><strong><em>A few key details on the order:<br></em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>People will be allowed to leave their homes to buy groceries, fill up cars with gas, visit the doctor, and go to the bank.  Residents may also go outside for a walk or exercise but should attempt to keep at least six feet away from others.</em></li>
<li><em>All 'non-essential' businesses will close. That means most non-food retail outlets. Grocery stores, pharmacies, and restaurants can remain open with restrictions.</em></li>
<li><em>People who can work from home are required to do so.  </em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>We remain committed to supporting our community throughout the school closure and look forward to reconnecting with our students when we resume e-learning on March 30!  Please feel free to contact us should you have any questions.</em></p>

We will communicate updates as soon as we receive new information. In the meantime, please practice social distancing.

<p><em>Dear CSD17 Students, Staff, and Families,</em></p>
<p><em>As you likely know, President Trump has officially declared a national emergency from the coronavirus pandemic. </em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, Governor, J.B. Pritzker announced that all Illinois K-12 schools will be closed to students beginning Tuesday, March 17th through Monday, March 30th. Students will report back to school beginning Tuesday, March 31, 2020. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>In CSD17:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Students will attend school on Monday, March 16.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Students will not attend school on Tuesday, March 17 due to a Teacher Institute Day. </em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Students will have e-learning days beginning on Wednesday, March 18 through Friday, March 20.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Students will observe spring break from March 23rd through March 27th during which time no e-learning will take place.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Monday, March 30 will be an e-learning day.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>During this time, all school-related functions, including sporting events and activities, will be canceled. </em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please begin planning for students to remain at home and engaged in e-learning.  Our <a href="https://sites.google.com/csd17.org/e-learning-days/home">e-learning website</a> provides details on our program. As our e-learning plan was designed for short-term closures, please be advised that the format is subject to change in this unique extended leave situation.</em></p>
<p><em>Governor Pritzker stated that they will actively assess the situation through this two-week time period for the possibility of further closure if public health risks continue past March 30.  As of the writing of this letter, there are no known cases of coronavirus in Channahon or Will County. To prevent spread of coronavirus, students should remain at home to the greatest extent possible and not be in close contact with other children.</em></p>
<p><em>We remain committed to working closely with health officials and will also continue to communicate with you as this situation evolves. Thank you for your support in helping to keep our school community healthy.  </em></p>

<p><em><br></em></p>
<p><em>Dear CSD17 Students, Staff, and Families,</em></p>
<p><em>As you know, Channahon School District 17 is closely monitoring the impact of the coronavirus in Illinois.   We will continue to follow the recommendations of the Will County Health Department, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), and the Center for Disease Control (CDC).  We have been working with our team as well as local officials to prepare for the possibility of an extended closure and potential activation of our e-learning plan.</em></p>
<p><em>Currently, there are no known cases of coronavirus in Channahon or Will County.  At this time, the IDPH recommends that schools hold classes and events as usual.  However, the cancellation of school field trips and other community events within our schools will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.  Should we elect to cancel field trips or community events, we will make every effort to notify you in advance of the cancelation.  Please remember, as parents and guardians, you have the ability to opt-out of a school field trip.</em></p>
<p><em>We will continue to follow IDPH recommendations including an increase in deep cleaning and disinfecting procedures. Our process in disinfecting our schools is to have our trained Facilities and Operations staff disinfect our classrooms, offices, and hallways throughout the day and after school using a hospital-grade disinfectant. </em></p>
<p><em>We also continue to monitor the number of students with flu and flu-like symptoms as well as those at home with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. At this time we are seeing very low absence percentages for this time of year. The IDPH maintains that the best way to protect against coronavirus is by taking the same everyday precautions against getting sick in general. These include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</em></li>
<li><em>Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands</em></li>
<li><em>Avoiding close contact with people who are sick</em></li>
<li><em>Staying home when you are sick - keep your child home from school until they are fever-free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medicine</em></li>
<li><em>Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash - if a tissue is not available, cough and sneeze into your arm or shoulder (not into your hands)</em></li>
<li><em>Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>We will continue to communicate with you as this situation evolves including any significant changes in recommendations for schools. Thank you for your support in helping to keep our school community healthy.</em></p>
