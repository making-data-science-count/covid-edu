<div>Families can engage students with learning resources through this LiveBinder to reinforce skills and knowledge. The plan is designed to support ongoing learning, provide internet access to students, and reinforce GCPS staff members’ connection with students, families, and the community during the closure. We are committed to supporting learning through a variety of digital and non-digital materials, activities, and resources to continue learning at home. Lessons and materials developed by the district are included throughout this depository. <strong>Lessons and materials autonomously developed by individual teachers, under the guidance of building principals and supervisors, are available through those teachers.</strong> Teachers have posted office hours and are available during these time blocks to assist students and parents with planning, understanding, and successfully completing assignments.</div>

<h3>Garrett County Public Schools Announces New Timeline for the Continuity of Learning Plan</h3>

<div><strong>04/10/2020 at 11:23am</strong></div>
</div>

<div>
<div> </div>

<div>April 10, 2020</div>

<div> </div>

<div>We at GCPS have heard from a number of parents and families that the learning activities and assignments previously distributed in Phase 2 of the Continuity of Learning Plan take a considerable amount of time for students and require a lot of help from parents. We want you to know that we understand that this is adding stress to some families during this difficult time. In an effort to address this, and again try to calm anxiety, the Elementary Packets for Phase 3 of the Continuity of Learning Plan will contain fewer assignments and will not be distributed until Friday, April 24, 2020. By changing this date, elementary students will gain an additional week to make direct contact with their teachers, have the opportunity to determine any individual adjustments that may be needed, and to allow additional time to work toward completion of the packets. This change will also align with the next middle and high school pickup timelines so that families will not need to make multiple trips.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>In addition, we have also heard from a number of parents that the packets could be better organized. To address this, we will ensure that the pages are aligned, numbered when possible, and are not copied front-to-back. We feel like this will make the packets more user friendly and simpler for our youngest students to complete the activities.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Please be assured that the goal of the GCPS Continuity of Learning Plan is to offer learning opportunities for each child. It was never our intention to cause undue stress or anxiety during this incredibly difficult time.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>
<div>Please continue to be patient as this is a new way of learning for all of us. The teachers and all of the GCPS staff who support learning are working to ensure that our students have the tools needed to stay engaged. If for any reason you feel that you or your child does not have these tools and resources or if you need an extension, a revision, or a waiver for the included assignments, please do not hesitate to reach out to your teachers and/or your principal.</div>

<h3>A Message from Superintendent of Schools Barbara Baker</h3>

<div><strong>04/07/2020 at 9:36 am</strong></div>

<div> </div>
</div>

<div>
<div>Parents/Guardians, Students, and Community Members,</div>

<div> </div>

<div>It is my sincerest hope that this letter finds you healthy and well taken care of at this very difficult time in all of our lives. Throughout this week before the Easter holiday, I plan to provide updates each day into the work of our school system that has been taking place during the closure mandated by Governor Larry Hogan and State Superintendent Karen Salmon. The information and guidance that citizens receive from our leaders in Annapolis changes quite frequently and that often impacts what information I can provide from the school system. That is why I would like to spend this week sharing some of the great things we are doing and to hopefully calm the fear and anxiety of both students and parents now that the Continuity of Learning plan has begun to be implemented. The health and safety of our children, their parents and loved ones, our employees and their families, and our health care providers is of the utmost importance at this time.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>As soon as the closure was announced, Dr. Salmon directed all local superintendents to begin working on a plan to address a lengthy closure that would keep students engaged in their own learning. Unfortunately, there are a number of questions surrounding this plan that have yet to be worked out, the least of which is what days will and will not count toward the 180 days of school requirement and what can and cannot be applied to promotion and graduation. So, my team and I spent the first two weeks planning and strategizing about how to best go about keeping students engaged in their own learning. What we came up with is not perfect and we know we can do better! As educators, we are trying to reach all children, include the main content, address fine arts and physical activity, and provide as many resources as we can. So, the main point of my message today is this: Please do not panic or stress over the amount of work and papers that are included in the packets or has been loaded onto devices. Your teachers have set up office hours to help you with the content and assignments. A help desk is being implemented to provide assistance for technical issues. And my team and I stand at the ready to provide any additional support you may need! Our intention was never to add to the stress that each of us is feeling at this uncertain time, but rather to provide a way for all of our children to remain engaged in their own learning.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>As stated earlier, the guidance we receive from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) changes frequently. Dr. Salmon, Maryland State Superintendent of Schools, announced that while schools may distribute learning packets, using safety precautions in the preparation and distribution, schools may not collect the learning packets once they are completed for health and safety reasons. Therefore, for now, parents will need to maintain the completed packets until we receive additional guidance from the MSDE. So, at this point, all work should stay at home. It will be collected when we know more about the requirements for graduation and promotion, or when the school system is permitted to re-open. Please understand that I completely empathize with your frustration regarding the changing guidance and requirements. For now, the best advice I can give is to complete the work at your own pace, do the very best you can under the circumstances, keep reading and practicing your math facts, and work with your teachers on assignments you don’t understand.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Please continue to be patient as this is a new way of learning for all of us. There will be mistakes made and lessons to be learned, but we will figure this out as we move forward. Our teachers, administrators, instructional assistants, food service personnel, custodians, and all of the wonderful people that work in our school system are here to help you! Please enjoy the time with your family this holiday weekend and come back to the work next week. I hope the resources provided for the students will bring a sense of normalcy back to our families.</div>

<h3>A Message from the Interim Director of Special Education</h3>

<div><strong>04/03/2020 at 11:59 am</strong></div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<div> </div>

<div>Parents/Guardians of Students with Disabilities,</div>

<div> </div>

<div>I want to start by saying that we, in Garrett County Public Schools, hope you and your family are safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Please know that you and your child’s safety, along with those individuals providing services, are our top priority as we navigate special education services during this time.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>You should have received a phone call from your IEP Coordinator or Infants and Toddlers Service Coordinator over the past week, or you will be receiving one later today. The purpose of this call is to review our county’s Continuity of Learning Plan and to discuss how we can support your child during this time while continuing to provide IEP/IFSP services. You will also be receiving a Prior Written Notice (PWN) in the mail, indicating that we will continue to provide a free, appropriate, public, education (FAPE) to the maximum extent possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, your child’s case manager will be contacting you in the coming week to arrange specific times and methods of service delivery. They will continue to be in constant communication with you and your child during this time to ensure your child is receiving their accommodations, modifications, and services.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>If you have any questions or concerns during this time, please do not hesitate to reach out to your child’s special education teacher, school IEP Coordinator, IFSP Service Coordinator, or myself. We are here to support you and your child during this time. In addition, we have created a Facebook page labeled, “GCPS Department of Special Education” that is open to the community. We will be posting resources and updates on this page, as they apply specifically to special education. As I stated earlier, please let us know if we can do anything to help during this time. We are looking forward to seeing our students again once schools are reopened.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Take Care,</div>

<h3>GCPS Announces Meal Delivery Plan for the Next Two Weeks</h3>

<div><strong>04/01/2020 at 11:45 am</strong></div>

<div>
<div>The meal delivery to all 16 sites throughout the county will continue. Only the delivery to students’ homes has been discontinued. It is necessary, however, to adjust the schedule in the coming weeks. Again, we do appreciate your patience as we make adjustments to our plan to serve as many children as possible while still ensuring the safety of our employees. The holiday weekend has also been adjusted so that our employees may enjoy time with their families. Please note the following:</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Friday, April 3, 2020 – No meal delivery</div>

<div>Friday, April 10, 2020 (Good Friday) – No meal delivery</div>

<div>Monday, April 13, 2020 (Easter Monday) – No meal delivery</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Thursday, April 2, 2020 – Two days of meals will be delivered to all 16 sites</div>

<div>Thursday, April 9, 2020 – Three days of meals will be delivered to all 16 sites</div>

<div> </div>
</div>

<h3>GCPS Continuing Meal Delivery; Must Suspend Home Delivery</h3>

<div>
<div><strong>03/31/2020 at 9:40 am</strong></div>

<div> </div>

<div>
<div>Garrett County Public Schools will continue meal delivery to the 16 sites throughout the county. However, the home delivery option must be discontinued in response to Governor Hogan’s mandate that all non-essential personnel stay home. At this time, the delivery of meals to the current sites does meet the definition of an essential service to children. We thank you again for your patience as we adapt our practices in order to keep our employees, their families, and the community safe.</div>

<h3>Continuity of Learning to Begin April 6, 2020</h3>

<div><strong>03/28/2020 at 6:42 pm</strong></div>

<div> </div>
</div>

<div>
<div>Governor Hogan and State Superintendent Salmon announced that all public schools in the state of Maryland would be closed for an additional four weeks. Garrett County Public Schools central office and school-based administrative staff have been working during the two-week emergency closure of all Maryland schools to prepare for the format and distribution of student work now that schools are closed through April 24th.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The third grading period will end Friday, April 3, 2020. The fourth grading term will begin on Monday, April 6th. Teachers will accept any and all work submitted on or before April 3 and grade assignments as per their classroom procedure.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>This upcoming week, each principal will work with teachers and support staff to finalize the online learning component, if applicable. The continuity of learning will officially begin on April 6th for students through various means depending on the students’ and families’ connectivity and technology access. Each principal has the results of the survey regarding technology that was publicized during the emergency closure period. However, families may receive an email or phone call from GCPS central office staff or your child’s school to ensure that we have as much information as possible to make informed decisions. Based on those results, teachers may distribute learning packets to students who do not have online connectivity and/or technology. These learning packets will also be distributed the week of April 6th. Please follow the directions that will be included with the packet or provided by the principals via the school system website.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>We ask for your patience as GCPS works through the transition to online learning and/or the distribution and content of learning packets.</div>

<div>
<div>High school students taking AP exams in May can get support from the College Board while schools are closed due to the coronavirus.</div>

<div>Beginning on Wednesday, March 25, students and schools will have access to free, live AP review lessons, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. The lessons will focus on reviewing the skills and concepts from the first 75% of the course. These mobile-friendly classes are:</div>

<li>Designed to be used alongside work that may be given by schools.</li>
	<li>Recorded and will be available on-demand so teachers and students can access them any time.</li>

<h3>Update on GCPS Meal Sites and Delivery</h3>

<h3>GCPS Update on COVID-19</h3>

<div>
<div><strong>03/19/2020 at 12:36 pm</strong></div>

<div> </div>

<div>The following message is from Ms. Barbara L. Baker, Superintendent of Schools:</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Dear Parents, Students, and Community Members,</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The administration and staff of Garrett County Public Schools (GCPS) continue to review the decision made by the state superintendent to close all Maryland public schools for two weeks. I would like to update our families on the latest developments regarding the school system’s progress to address the pandemic. GCPS leaders have been working to provide learning opportunities for students during the period of closure. To that end, we have created a survey to assess how to best reach all students. School principals will be distributing the survey and tabulating the data for each school community. In order to ensure that we are reaching as many families as possible, they may also reach out to families via email or by phone. Beginning Monday, we will use the preliminary results to plan for the continuity of instruction for all grade levels. We are exploring all options including video lessons and project-based learning. If your child received a packet of work to complete during the closure, please have him or her continue to work on it. When we return to school, teachers may review the assignments but grades will not be taken.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>I am also pleased to share that we are feeding all children 18 years or younger at sixteen sites across Garrett County. On our first day, we served 176 meals! Starting on Friday, we will also be offering a hot supper every day Monday through Friday throughout the closure period. We have had a number of local businesses and restaurants offering to donate additional “grab-n-go” options to ensure that our young people do not go hungry during the closure period. A special thank-you goes out to them.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Please understand that we know that this situation is creating many hardships for those in our community. Most of the questions I have received center on the length of the closure and whether or not we will be able to return to normal operations. The state superintendent, Dr. Karen Salmon, has been meeting with all local superintendents via conference call on a regular basis thus far. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the virus, she has made it clear that students are not to be in any school building or on school property. Therefore, no one is to be on our playgrounds or using school property as a place to meet or congregate. She has not provided any additional information as to whether the closure would be extended beyond two weeks.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>At this juncture I am unable to answer questions regarding the impact of the virus on our traditional end of year activities such as proms, promotion ceremonies, or even graduation. This ever-changing situation also impacts many other things such as standardized testing, AP exams, college applications, and spring sports. The status of all of the events and activities will be determined as we receive more information from the Maryland State Department of Education if the closure extends beyond two weeks. Our team will work through each one and provide regular communication through our website, school messenger, and social media. There is a dedicated page on our website (<a href="https://www.garrettcountyschools.org/coronavirus">www.garrettcountyschools.org/coronavirus</a>) that contains all of the COVID-19 information we have. You will find the most up to date information regarding the school system’s response, CDC guidelines, and links to resources for parents and families. The central office of GCPS is currently closed to the public. However, you may send an email to: <a href="mailto:public.info@garrettcountyschools.org">public.info@garrettcountyschools.org</a> or to a specific individual and your email will be returned as soon as possible.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Thank you for your continued support of Garrett County Public Schools and for your patience as we navigate through this unprecedented event. As soon as I have additional information I will communicate that to our GCPS Community.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Please take care to stay healthy and safe!</div>

<div> </div>
</div>

<h3>GCPS Now Offering Home Delivery of Meals</h3>

<h3>Maryland Association of Student Councils (MASC) Convention Cancelled</h3>

<div><strong>March 12, 2020</strong></div>

<div> </div>

<div>Due to the growing concern about the spread of COVID-19, Maryland Association of Student Councils (MASC) has decided to cancel the 2020 Spring Convention, originally scheduled for March 25-27th at the Clarion Fontainebleau Resort in Ocean City, MD. With so many counties canceling field trips, not approving large group gatherings, and not allowing spectators at many sporting events, MASC will follow suit and take the same precautions.</div>

<div>Update</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The MPSSAA has just announced that the state basketball championships scheduled for March 12-14 have been postponed. Both the boys' and girls' games are affected by this postponement. No date has been set yet for the games.</div>

<div> </div>

<div><strong>March 11, 2020</strong></div>

<div> </div>

<div>The State Tournament will be closed to fans and non essentials. The game may be attended by parents and guardians. The Southern High Athletic Department will be working with both coaching staffs as well as the MPSSAA to ensure a smooth transition for our teams and our parents through this difficult situation.</div>

<div>The Southern High Athletic Department will continue to update all with more information and will work with our parents.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The MPSSAA is currently working to live stream all State Tournament games.</div>

<div> </div>

<h3>GCPS Update on Coronavirus</h3>

<div><strong>March 11, 2020</strong></div>

<div> </div>

<div>
<div>Due to recent events regarding the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), in consultation with the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), is advising that all scheduled out-of-state and international field trips sanctioned by local school systems for students and staff be cancelled indefinitely. Therefore, until further notice, Garrett County Public Schools will be cancelling out of state travel for all students and staff.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>At this time, the MSDE is not advising that local school systems cancel in-state field trips or athletic contests. Therefore, all in-state trips will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis until further notice. We will continue to conference daily (or more frequently as needed) with the Garrett County Health Department. Those daily briefings will guide decisions on travel and the possible closing of schools or the entire district.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The health and safety of our school communities are paramount. We will continue to provide consistent communication and updates as we receive relevant information. At the current time, there are no confirmed cases in Garrett County or the surrounding areas. While the risk remains low for most populations, you can find more information at <a href="http://www.coronavirus.gov">www.coronavirus.gov</a>.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Please know that we continue to plan for any possible closures. In addition, custodians in each school are deep cleaning and disinfecting high traffic areas and classrooms every day. Our school nurses are working with Mrs. Becky Aiken, Nurse Manager, to closely monitor student health.</div>

<div> </div>

<h3><strong>GCPS Coronavirus Communication</strong></h3>

<div><strong>March 4, 2020</strong></div>

<div> </div>

<div>Garrett County Public Schools are monitoring the evolving coronavirus (COVID 19) outbreak and are in close communication with the state and local Health Departments. At present, there are no confirmed cases in our area. We are closely monitoring the situation and will act according to recommendations from public health officials. Many news networks have discussed measures to keep large groups of individuals from being in close contact, such as school closings and cancellation of sporting events and other activities. In addition, guidance and resources are being provided by a number of our partner agencies. Be assured that GCPS will immediately act on the recommendations of the Health Department and the Maryland State Department of Education should the need arise to close for an extended period of time or to cancel activities.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>In order to be proactive, Superintendent Barbara Baker is working with other districts and the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) to determine what measures can be taken to provide learning opportunities for students should schools be closed. In addition, when large numbers of students begin missing school due to illnesses, such as the influenza virus, the GCPS Operations department dispatches additional custodial staff to perform a deep cleaning of the affected areas of the school. Deep cleaning consists of wiping down all high contact areas such as desks, doorknobs, water fountains, and other high traffic areas with a disinfectant cleaner along with a complete spray down using a specialized piece of cleaning equipment. We will follow the same protocol to address the coronavirus as necessary.</div>
