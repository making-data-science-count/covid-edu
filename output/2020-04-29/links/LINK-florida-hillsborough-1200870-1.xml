<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Why did you change from providing Grab-and-Go meals every day, to once a week?</h4>
<p class="answer">Our district is constantly in contact with state officials while monitoring the current CDC guidelines, which can change at any time during this fluid situation. Following Governor Ron DeSantis’ Stay at Home order for the state, Hillsborough Schools worked diligently to create a meal distribution plan that minimizes contact between our Student Nutrition Services workers and families. We will distribute meals at our 147 sites every Wednesday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. School buses will also follow the same food drop-off routes, while providing a week’s worth of food on Wednesday only. We believe distributing one week’s worth of food at a time will provide nutritious meals during this closure while still maintaining social distancing guidelines to keep our community safe.</p>

<h4 class="ref question">What kind of food should I expect for the weekly Grab-and-Go meals?</h4>
<p class="answer">Each student will receive one pound of lunch meat, one loaf of bread, 10 cartons of milk, along with juice, cereal, and other nutritious snacks for the week. Substitutions may be made at any site depending on supply issues. Each child will receive enough food for each school day. There is enough food to feed one child for each school day. Even though the food assortment is changing from what our staff has been distributing on the daily menu, it will still meet nutritional requirements. The food will be separated into two bags; one for items that need to be refrigerated, and the other for prepackaged items that do not need to stay cold.</p>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Why do you distribute meals on Wednesdays?</h4>
<p class="answer">School districts across the country are also providing meals for students during this nationwide closure, which means it can be more difficult than usual to receive food supplies when we need them. In order to keep up with the massive demand to feed our families, our suppliers must deliver over a number of days, and Wednesday is the best distribution day to ensure we will have enough food for every student who needs these meals. This also allows our Student Nutrition Staff enough time to account for supply issues, as well as packing a week’s worth of food for each student.</p>
<hr class="divider">
</li>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Why aren’t we receiving hot food anymore?</h4>
<p class="answer">Hot food would require our Student Nutrition Staff to distribute meals on a daily basis. With the newest CDC guidelines, our district is minimizing the amount of contact our staff has with families. For this reason, students will be receiving a bag of food that needs to be refrigerated along with a bag of snacks that do not need to stay cold.</p>
<hr class="divider">
</li>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Are there any suggestions on how to make food last for seven days?</h4>
<p class="answer">Our district has created a meal plan for each week of food to make sure students and families can make the meals last through the following Tuesday. Our Student Nutrition Services staff will provide tips each week, along with a menu to make it easier for families. The meal plans will be posted on our social media channels and our website: <a href="https://Hillsboroughschools.org/coronavirus/grabandgo" target="_blank">Hillsboroughschools.org/coronavirus/grabandgo</a></p>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Are these meals only for students in financial need?</h4>
<p class="answer">Any family with children 18 years old and younger can take advantage of our 147 Grab-and-Go sites. You do not need to demonstrate financial need in order to pick up meals. They are available for any child under the age of 18, and under the age of 21 for students with special needs.</p>
<hr class="divider">
</li>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Will buses continue to send food into specific neighborhoods in need?</h4>
<p class="answer">Yes, the transportation staff will still be distributing the meals to the same sites as before. However, it is important to note with this new distribution system, the bags will be much heavier. Both bags together will weigh just over 10 pounds. For students and families who are walking or riding a bike to receive meals, we suggest using your child’s empty backpack to store food on the way back home. Your student may need extra help to carry the food home, considering the amount of food they will be receiving at once.</p>
<hr class="divider">
</li>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Will I still be able to walk up and receive food?</h4>
<p class="answer">While we encourage families to drive to a distribution site to minimize contact with Student Nutrition Services workers, we will still provide walk up service for families without transportation. Please note, the bags you will receive weekly will weigh over 10 pounds. Your child can use their empty backpack from home to store the meals on the way home as a way to ensure they can carry it comfortably and safely.</p>
<hr class="divider">
</li>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">What happens if I can’t make it to pick up free meals on Wednesdays?</h4>
<p class="answer">Wednesdays are the only day our district can provide food for students due to supply issues and federal social distancing guidelines. If you cannot make it to one of our 147 sites on Wednesdays during the hours of 9 a.m. and 1 p.m., there are other options in our community for free meals: </p>
<p class="answer">Visit the <a href="http://feedingtampabay.org/find-a-pantry/" target="_blank">Feeding Tampa Bay website</a> for a list of food pantries near your home. Feeding Tampa Bay is also offering daily breakfast for children along with other meal offerings for people in Hillsborough County in need of free meals.</p>

</li>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Does my child have to be present to receive a grab and go meal?</h4>
<p class="answer">To maintain accountability when parents or guardians pick up meals on behalf of a child, our Student Nutrition Services employees will use the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="sublistnum">
<li>We encourage parents/guardians to go to the Grab and Go school location where their child is enrolled, if possible. If the child is not with the parent/guardian, our Student Nutrition employee will contact an on-site school administrator to speak with the parent/guardian and verify that the child is enrolled. We ask that parents know their child’s student number.</li>
<li>If a parent/guardian has children enrolled at more than one school, they can go to one school for all meals. The parent will provide the students’ names to the school administrator including the names of the other children and what school(s) they attend. The Grab and Go meals will be provided and we will contact the other schools to let them know that the students received meals for the day.</li>
</ol>
<hr class="divider">
</li>

<li>
<h4 class="ref question">Do a certain number of meals have to be served each day for Student Nutrition Staff members to keep their jobs?</h4>
<p class="answer">There is no quota to be met in regard to the number of meals that need to be served at each site and Student Nutrition Services' jobs are not at risk during this time.</p>
<p class="answer">During this global pandemic, our Student Nutrition Services team is here continuing to feed children throughout Hillsborough County. These "emergency meals" include breakfast and lunch and are intended for ANY child 18 years and under who is in need, including those with special needs who are 21 years of age or younger.</p>
