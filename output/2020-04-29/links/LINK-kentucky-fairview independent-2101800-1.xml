<p>Fairview Students and Families,</p>

<p>Note from Superintendent Smith... The mental health of everyone is my most important concern right now. If your child is struggling or you are struggling, we will work with you. Teachers will talk with you and help you help your child with their work. Teachers will talk with your child and help them with the work. We will extend deadlines without penalty if you reach out to us. Please know we are here to help and will do everything we can to help all involved in not being overwhelmed. If students are experiencing concerns beyond the work, we have mental health counselors and can provide you contact information. The mental health of everyone is more important than anything right now.</p>

<p>I am also concerned about school staff and the pressure that they have with everything. I have clarified with them this morning that they are expected to be available for assistance with NTI work during daytime work hours only. It is not my expectation that they get back with you in a timely manner on nights and weekends. They cannot take care of themselves and their families and be on call 24 hours a day. If this results in teachers not answering your questions until the next day and it causes a delay in student work completion... students and families - do not worry! Contact the teacher and an extension will be given without penalty to the student's grade.</p>

<p>We cannot let this situation with NTI work result in our students, families, and teachers being overwhelmed at a level that it is impacting your mental health. We have to stay strong <a class="_58cn" data-ft='{"type":104,"tn":"*N"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/teamfairview?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARB58j7Qpio5yMyAoRtCPs9W76v0pJz2PGSE6YZiHNExdK4XuEFaGIG02lhnh396g_VgBfbQ4qQsMaDvmc4BogGgqhkQuSrYBYFnAxUUeal5JXPm-_4NCQH1Xfas28Jq745mWCPcvd506cPIvflkJwbBn0gkgVpiccylzYt42JG71hgP16jgtlXqem5wau2-f0gQpKw7Du1htzywGYENBREb0pJFQUcvbkCmwm6AwQQP9HGqC-PnaB980vXAa_Xsqe9ICpVZ8hXWzEzGC9U8B9YO4KWeDKJFfZNt9u8hpjs3D9GB06sHHUfoMcd8n7DmB-FM2hes83uIG16Ctp9dLAA&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R"><span class="_5afx"><span aria-label="hashtag" class="_58cl _5afz">#</span><span class="_58cm">TEAMFairview</span></span></a>!</p>

<p>For many reasons, we have to have rigorous instruction at this time. We have to have due dates on the instruction. We have to state a final date for late work so that grades can be finalized for this year. We have to have processes in place to ensure safety of everyone. We have to have lengthy processes and systems and this results in us having to have lengthy plans with a lot of details that can overwhelm everyone. All of this said, we can make an adjustment on most everything right now if it is necessary based on individual situations, but you must communicate individually with your child's teacher. On Monday I posted a document with phone numbers for every instructional staff member. You can contact them at this number or through another contact method they have already provided you. They will help you. Right now, I want everyone to take care of themselves more than anything. - Supt. Smith</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Senior Focus Group</strong></p>

<p>A Senior Focus Group has been developed to provide input into decision making related to the senior experience during this unprecedented time.</p>

<p>The group includes district and school leadership, staff class sponsors, teachers, the district nurse, and current seniors.</p>

<p>The group met today in a Google Meet and will meet 2-3 days weekly over the coming weeks.</p>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>During the meeting today, the Senior Focus Group discussed many senior experiences. This conversation included options for the graduation ceremony. The Group discussed the federal and state guidance recently released and considerations for a graduation ceremony at all phases and benchmarks based on the guidance.</p>

<p>The Fairview Independent School District will not have a graduation ceremony at the end of May, but will delay it at this time until later in the summer.</p>

<p>A traditional graduation ceremony is not going to be an option for the 2020 graduating class. Although there will likely be significant restrictions still in place later in the summer, and possibly the same restrictions in place that we have currently, delaying the graduation ceremony until later in the summer will allow more time for positive change to occur. More time allows for improvements in our current situation as it relates to the federal phases and state benchmark determinations. We want to give our seniors the best graduation experience possible while continuing to keep the safety and well-being of everyone our number one priority.</p>

<p>We are working on several ways to recognize our seniors over the next few months. Our last day of school will be May 20, 2020. We look forward to sharing a Senior Class video on this day as a celebration of each senior in the Class of 2020.</p>

<p>More information will be communicated as decisions are made. Thank you for your continued partnership as we work together to give our students our best! <a class="_58cn" data-ft='{"type":104,"tn":"*N"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/futurefocused?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD40cV4Rq9R5Hz0kxU1D40LEHHpEq-ey7oSWcr77mldOU3CXyBMKbGEuUVXhVJXAlIX6mOntfD441A3FhjZi6TNV7ylbOz4JmvYn0nEmO9OVHsyE5kSdDGtnk3nPAzCHiHdThXtl4XBs7hvsrW9-3HIcHHM5_T_lpA0nBRAYTbMob-xnCCtbd0Q1z1U-x9Dq9uu1t2nenkq5HPK3V23YgpWWd2dy5BRXYHTMrLlddyW2Vb9SOTq6vHsLZrSG0kXppFqhjTAR5iozJIFNfC6O80lxGFUgFd73efjXtxRc_aA7xavXfi__QN0y3vxS5UXL-dfOEME3eL6kDURE8Tbw5zriZ-8BZBxW4AFtylPowRK9mLoBw&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R"><span class="_5afx"><span aria-label="hashtag" class="_58cl _5afz">#</span><span class="_58cm">FutureFocused</span></span></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>District COVID-19 Letter to Fairview Family</strong></p>

<p>Dear Fairview Students, Educators, Families, and Community,</p>

<p>I want to do something I have not done in previous communications and start off this letter to you on a personal note. Over the past month, I’ve truly experienced change that has changed me not only as a person, but as a leader. My entire life, I have been someone who welcomes change and although I’ve known my comfort level in adapting to change isn’t something most people understand, it has always been a big part of who I am. Just as you have experienced new emotions during what has been the most unprecedented international crisis of our lifetime, I want you to know that I have as well. What we are going through has been a level of change unimaginable and certainly not welcomed. It has changed me because I’ve not known the answer or been able to find the answer necessary to develop a possible solution because so much has been unknown. My usual “I don’t know, but will look into it and find a solution” response to concerns due to this crisis has been impossible and instead I’ve had to say frequently, “I don’t know and there isn’t an answer to find or a solution I can come up with at this time.” This has been a challenge for me far greater than I could have ever imagined.</p>

<p>As I believe many of you are experiencing the same response in your emotions, I’ve felt the need to share this with you on a personal level. In addition to responding to this crisis in the superintendent role that you know me in, I am also experiencing many of the emotions that you are right now in the roles that you have while going through this change. As we move forward, I encourage you to join me in finding peace knowing that sometimes the things we can’t change, create an opportunity to change us in a way that we never imagined.</p>

<p>Since early March, it has been my priority to be transparent and communicate with you throughout this change, as we have worked to embrace it and move forward creating the best solutions possible for everyone involved. It has also been my priority to explain the “why” behind decisions and provide you every necessary detail to improve understanding. This is certainly the educator in me coming out. I will continue to do so in this letter to you.</p>

<p>Yesterday, our governor recommended that school districts not resume in person classes or activities this year. Although this news was unwelcomed by many with hopes we’d return, it was expected given the seriousness of the health crisis we currently face. Again, yesterday, you faced more news of change, and just as you’ve done over the past six weeks, you are stepping out of your comfort zone again in response to this crisis.</p>

<p>Students, you have dealt with a change in your life where your normal routine has been turned upside down. You’ve lost in-person connections with your friends and educators. You’ve adjusted to at home instruction where you’ve not had the same instructional supports you did before. You’ve not had the parts of the school experience that can’t be measured by performance on an assignment or your score on a test. You need to know that although school has been closed to in-person classes, we have not been closed. The educators in your life are still in your life and they are working for you during this time. You will be back to school next year. Students, you will not only be okay, but you will be better because of this.</p>

<p>Educators, You have came into work to prepare meals for kids while you’ve been scared to do so. You’ve missed your kids terribly and worried about their well being. You’ve stressed about standards and the content you know your students will not learn before going into next year. You’ve adapted to a new way of planning and designing instruction and understand that this really isn’t “homeschool” as many have said, because the work you do before and after the at home instruction occurs is a huge part of what is happening. You will be back to school next year. Educators, you will not only be okay, but you will be better because of this.</p>

<p>Parents and Families, You have added on the role of a teacher to your already overwhelming list of roles and responsibilities. You have been the educator in your children’s lives that you’ve always been in helping them understand what is happening in their world around them. You have responded to your children’s fears while going through your own fears yourself. You have helped your children understand why decisions are being made when they are disappointed, sad, and angry because their desires and wants as children aren’t possible in this situation. You have adjusted to all of the hats you are wearing and now appreciate the work of educators in a new way and may possibly even regret some of your past critisims related to public schools as you now better understand the role of an educator. You are exhausted. Your kids will be back to school next year. Parents and families, you will not only be okay, but you will be better because of this.</p>

<p>Community, You understand that it truly takes a community to raise a child. You have stepped up again to do your part to meet the needs of all students. You have supported <a class="_58cn" data-ft='{"type":104,"tn":"*N"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/teamfairview?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBzpBDo5804S6Kh01SlnutD01jx09-KIY2ts0GU1F6-cIjLerKoOJWFP8pkPs19Rnbd8RfNKYp9SnVq59dVlPieTILuHseOBaGxVoT9xWA5T4Ts2XoOqe1qYZmJDpbNxI5sw8WBHbYEL3reDIS649bRCn9RUWxKA79iYJRaqClV8DJst-wQRjW-BBjRXGc9vf6ZAthHARWChNO_1lQYLMXv4uD4YqF7zX7Qymu5HqQrLVMMJ5B_alYFQkRGvMWcKHQGvBT-Fy1jY_dkoTfh1cavHGMHLrxK_jTUzJmGM15QL0dhT0FBXM_g1FE-6Lq8UKW2_dbruFW-6e4ij7A&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R"><span class="_5afx"><span aria-label="hashtag" class="_58cl _5afz">#</span><span class="_58cm">TeamFairview</span></span></a> and you know how valued you are in keeping the Fairview family strong and committed to giving your best to our future. Our kids will be back to school next year. Westwood Community, you will not only be okay, but you will be better because of this.</p>

<p>Now, getting back to business and the superintendent you know…</p>

<p>Throughout this unprecedented time, many decisions have been made quickly in response to changes as new information has developed. With the announcement late yesterday that we will not return to school this year, superintendents were presented with a Continuation Plan by the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE). Some of the details in this plan as it pertains to some of the new decision making later in this letter is as follows:</p>

<p>- All districts shall be closed to in-person classes and activities through the end of the 2019-2020 school year.</p>

<p>-All districts shall continue using non-traditional instruction (NTI) to deliver instruction for the remainder of the school year.</p>

<p>-Unless there are extraordinary circumstances, logistical hardships or intervening public health concerns, all districts are required to achieve at least 1,062 hours of instruction for the 2019-2020 school year and may go beyond 1,062 hours if they wish to continue NTI to their previously determined last day in the calendar.</p>

<p>In making all of the required calculations while considering the current crisis we face and the fatique of our students, educators, and parents/families with NTI instruction, the best decision for our district is that we meet the 1,062 hours of instruction requirement and not continue NTI beyond what is necessary to meet the 1,062 hours of instruction requirement. The last day for students in our district will change from May 28, 2020 to May 20, 2020.</p>

<p>I’ll take this opportunity to inform you of the process in this calculation since our last day for students may be before or after other districts surrounding us and you may want to understand why this is the case. Our instructional day is 6.33 hours. Other districts may have a shorter or longer instructional day. Students have been in attendance for 120 instructional days for 6.33 hours and three instructional days that were not full days and total 11 hours. This totals 770.6 hours of student attendance hours in our 2019/2020 calendar. This calculation results in our district being 291.4 hours short of the minimum 1062 hours requirement. The KDE is allowing districts to calculate all NTI days at 7 hours. The 30 NTI days from March 16, 2020 through May 1, 2020 result in 210 hours taken away from the 291.4 hours we are short on the 1062 hours requirement. This results in our district being 81.4 hours (12 days) short on the 1062 hour requirement. When 12 days are added after May 1, 2020, our last day for students will be May 20, 2020.</p>

<p>Students in grades Pre-K through 11th grade will not be required to complete the 3rd project that was provided to them. Students in grade 12 will not be required to complete the last two projects that were provided to them.</p>

<p>I am not going to make a decision on senior activities at this time. Our belief statement in our district is as follows: As a TEAM, we will be DIFFERENCE MAKERS in the lives our students by giving them our BEST in EVERTHING that we do. Last week, I met with our seniors in a Google Meet and shared our commitment to them in giving them our best while our number one priority would remain being their health and safety. If we wait at this time, we have the opportunity to make sure we give them our best. A Senior Focus Committee has been developed to include senior class officers, senior class sponsors, and other educators in our district wanting to be involved in planning going forward. This Committee has their first meeting scheduled for tomorrow and will provide valuable input into decision making going forward, as recommendations based on public health data is released and communication continues with superintendents from our Governor and Commissioner of Education.</p>

<p>I understand there are many questions that you have that are still unanswered. I ask for your continued patience as I work with others on our team to determine the best solutions. I will continue to update you with communication from the district as new information becomes available. These updates will be on our website and on Facebook, and when appropriate, in a letter such as this. Thank you for your flexibility, understanding, and teamwork. Together, we will get through this and our Fairview Family will be stronger because of it. Do not hesitate to reach out to me if needed.</p>

Future Focused,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NTI Closure Plan Updates as of April 20, 2020</strong></p>

<p>A few UPDATES to the Emergency Closure NTI plan have been made in yellow in the attachment. This includes an extended opportunity to drop off NTI assignments for days 11-20. NTI assignments for days 11-20 should be dropped off in the totes in front of the Central Office or in the drive thru at FMS/FHS. There may not always be someone to monitor drop off in the FMS/FHS drive thru and totes may not always be available, however totes will ALWAYS be in front of Central Office for the dates/times in the attached plan. As explained in the original plan, Simple Solution books should stay at home with students and completed work should be torn out. Many answers to your questions regarding the system for our emergency NTI program is included in this document.</p>

<p>All students in grades 3rd thru 12th received three projects electronically in their Google Classroom on Friday. All students in grades Pre-K thru 2nd were mailed three projects on Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>In the attached NTI plan, the first column includes the days of NTI Instruction broken into days 1-10, 11-20, and 21-30.</p>

<p>The second column includes the way in which students received their NTI student assignments.</p>

<p>The last column includes the due dates for student assignments and the plan for turning in the student work.</p>

<p>Every day this week there will be a tote on the bench under the awning in front of the Central Office where late NTI work for days 1-10 may be dropped off from 9:00-11:00.</p>

<p>As you review the new student project based learning assignments that start today, we understand that you may have specific questions related to the NTI student assignment. All instructional staff are available from 8:00 - 11:00 and 12:00 - 3:00. In addition to the other modes of communication you currently use in contacting staff members, you can also contact them by phone on the phone number in the attachment.

<p>The Central Office has someone available to answer phone calls from 9:00 - 11:00 daily if you have a change of address. The phone number is 606-324-3877.</p>

<div class="_5pbx userContent _3ds9 _3576" data-ft='{"tn":"K"}' data-testid="post_message" id="js_ex">
<p>Please see an important message below.</p>

<p>Fairview Families,</p>

<p>On Monday, I asked teachers to communicate with parents and families who had not yet picked up their child’s NTI work for days 11-20. I asked them to let parents and families know to pick it up tomorrow when dropping of completed NTI work for days 1-10.</p>

<p>During previous pickups staff have wore gloves and masks, however since making this decision Monday, I am no longer comfortable with this protective measure alone to protect all involved due to the fast changing circumstances. There will be no NTI pickup tomorrow. We will do the work necessary and spend the funds necessary to mail out all remaining packets tomorrow and Saturday. I know this may not be a decision appreciated by many, but it is best.</p>

<p>So that you are aware, the student assignments contained in the packets have not been touched for over 10 days.</p>

<p>Student drop off of NTI student work for Days 1-10 will still be tomorrow from 2:00-6:00 and Saturday from 10:00-11:00 in the drive-thru on the cafeteria side of FMS/FHS. Staff will be present to monitor drop off of student work from inside the building. I’ve directed staff to not exit the building or open the door to anyone. Please do not come to the cafeteria doors and attempt to engage in interaction with the staff member present.</p>

<p>I ask that those dropping off student work in the drive thru line wait until the person in line in front of them exits and gets back in their vehicle before exiting their vehicle to drop off their child’s work. There will be large boxes to drop the completed NTI work in. If you are not comfortable dropping off your child’s work, you are welcome to mail it to 2201 Main St. W. Ashland, KY 41102. Please let your child’s teacher know in advance if you are mailing it. If it is postmarked by Tuesday, April 14, 2020, it will be considered “on time” due to this change. This gives five additional days for you to arrange mailing.</p>

<p>There will be no pick-up of student work involved for NTI days 21-30 that will start on Monday, April 20, 2020. Teachers are working hard this week to plan project based learning assignments for NTI days 21-30 and in situations and/or grades where paper assignments are necessary, they will be mailed as well. More information will come out next week to explain the project based learning assignments in greater detail but this should allow for a positive adjustment for students and families who now need some differentiation as student and parent frustration with the same learning experiences can be prevented with this approach and allow for quality and rigorous opportunities for our students. More information on NTI days 21-30 is forthcoming.</p>

<p>Change is hard and I understand a lot of change is coming at you at once. We are here to help you. Please let us do anything we can for you during these difficult times. Thank you for your patience, understanding, and teamwork while we work together to keep everyone on <a class="_58cn" data-ft='{"type":104,"tn":"*N"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/teamfairview?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAH2u2wSz0vHU25_Jx3siXt-tz6mGtBbcnwUISDCmHfoSwdWfejWo3uA4zNbgoDajTrAKxEMRebUzyunNYcdwWmXA7i4dc-t0oBSI-RvCEeb7ZUpcAjoZbaKRtKxlR2Tz-e2s4ou2ikY2Qn_tA-AqG3W1AI6EMrxtnpxGlDdLOCclcNOItTXlc1JfOo91qKs4LE_PVLwNQeXZ-8BvtyLEhdcZ1vFYHYsbNzKYmrFtUm3PY_lZYhepECvgZV7_K54tUM5pxEIx0GnFXjCE20HlzoDW7O2zO8_jeOCR6asS_iD8xfMeSzETX1Ostu1byw7F3yXHL4vZ9Ci_CMbgU&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R"><span class="_5afx"><span aria-label="hashtag" class="_58cl _5afz">#</span><span class="_58cm">TeamFairview</span></span></a> safe and healthy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Car Parade April 9, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Fairview Students, Families, and Westwood Community,</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Thursday, April 9, 2020, at 2:00 PM, Many of our Fairview Independent School District Educators will have a car parade around Westwood.</p>

<p>It is VERY important that everyone stay safe during this activity.</p>

<p>Educators who are able to participate will follow these safety expectations:</p>

<p>We will leave the parking lot next to the new gym at 2:00.</p>

<p>We will not get out of our vehicles.</p>

<p>We will not roll down our windows and talk to others in their vehicles, but will roll down our windows during the parade as long as others are at least 6 feet away.</p>

<p>We will not be in the back of a truck or have a convertible top down.</p>

<p>We will not be riding together in the same vehicle but educator's children and family may ride with them.</p>

<p>We will not get out of their vehicles.</p>

<p>We will not encourage students/parents/individuals to get near our vehicles for any reason.</p>

<p>We will not throw anything out of your vehicle or take anything from anyone along parade route.</p>

<p>We want you to be safe and not negatively contribute to any spread of the virus, therefore we encourage you to not come in close contact with neighbors during the parade.</p>

<p>We miss our students and can't wait to see them during the drive by parade tomorrow starting at 2:00.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Many students turned in work for NTI days 1-10 when picking up their assignments for NTI days 11-20. As communicated previously, the due date for student work for NTI days 1-10 is this Friday, April 10, 2020.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">On Friday, April 10, 2020, NTI student work can be dropped off in the drive-thru at FMS/FHS from 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM. NTI student work can also be dropped off in the drive-thru at FMS/FHS on Saturday, April <span class="text_exposed_show">11, 2020, from 10:00 AM-11:00 AM. We hope by extending the time until 6:00 PM and offering a Saturday drop off, it will better accommodate our families. If you cannot make arrangements to drop it off during these times, please contact one of your child's teachers before Friday and they will make us aware so we can make further arrangements.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Information is forthcoming for submission of NTI student work for days 11-20 that students are completing this week and next week.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We appreciate your continued flexibility, understanding, and teamwork as we work through this emergency NTI planning situation.</span></span></p>

You will need to enter the drive-thru as you did for NTI pickup. Please wait until the person in the car in front of you drops of their work and is in their vehicle before exiting your vehicle. A staff member will be present monitoring but will not be interacting with you during the drop off.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Revised Student Feeding Plan</strong></p>

<p>Attention Students and Families,</p>

<p>In an effort to 1) decrease interaction between educators in preparing and delivering meals, 2) decrease the time that they are present in the district, and 3) decrease face to face interaction with students and families, revisions have been made to our food service planning for the COVID-19 school closure.</p>

<p>Revisions to the original plan are in BLUE. Students will continue to receive five breakfast meals and five lunch meals weekly, however p<span class="text_exposed_show">ickup and delivery will only occur on Tuesday and Friday. Times for pickup and delivery have been revised as well. Students will receive a hot meal on Tuesday and Friday and meals that will need to be refrigerated for the other days. Students will not receive a decrease in food or meals due to this revision, however it allows for increased measures to ensure everyone's safety. This is not an income-based program. If you are interested in signing up, please call Terri Hood or Leigh Ann Jobe on Tuesday or Friday at the Central office between 11:00-12:00 at 606-324-3877.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NTI Packets and In-Person Class Information</strong></p>

<p>Dear Fairview Students, Educators, Families, and Community,</p>

<p>In a conference call with Governor Beshear at 2:00 today, he recommended that we extend the cease of in-person classes through May 1, 2020. It is in the best interest of our students, staff, families, and community that I close school in our district through May 1, 2020. These days will be emergency NTI days 21-30 in our school calendar.</p>

<p>This extended school closure resulting in an additional 10 emergency NTI days will require additional planning for dissemination of NTI student work for days 21-30. You are also awaiting a plan for turning in NTI student work for days 1-10 that is due on April 10, 2020, although many returned it last week when they picked up NTI student work for days 11-20. Today's decision to close school through May 1, 2020 results in our need as a district to finalize plans as a result of this new information. We will communicate these plans as soon as possible so we ask that you please be patient and know that we will get these final plans out to you as soon as possible. They will be posted on our website and on our district Facebook page.</p>

<p>Currently, the dissemination plan for distributing NTI student work (Days 11-20) occurred last week. If you do not have student work for NTI days 11-20 and hoped to receive it in the mail, we will not be mailing it out tomorrow as planned. It will be more efficient use of resources and more effective in practice to mail these when we can include days 21-30 with days 11-20. Again, we ask for your patience while we work to finalize the needed plans based on the decision made today.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for your continued flexibility, understanding, and teamwork during these challenging times. More information is forthcoming and I appreciate your patience.</p>

<p>Future Focused,</p>

<p>Jackie Risden-Smith<br>
Superintendent</p>

<p>Here is today’s daily message for #TeamFairview with hope that it adds some positivity to your day as we all go through these challenging times.</p>

<p>Courage - When we think about the word... the opportunity to exhibit this commendable quality only presents itself when we are up against something bigger than us, such as the situation we are currently facing. As hard as it can be at times, we have the opportunity to face every challenge with courage. So often courage is misunderstood to be the absence of fear, when courage is actually the resistance of fear.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Message From Superintendent Smith</strong></p>

<div class="_5pbx userContent _3576" data-ft='{"tn":"K"}' data-testid="post_message" id="js_1fr">
<p>Fairview Family,</p>

<p>This message is from Superintendent Smith.</p>

<p>During these challenging times we’re facing, I want to send out a statement of strength daily to our Fairview Family on behalf of the Fairview School District.</p>

<p>You can read these yourself, read them to your children and family you’re healthy at home with, or just scroll on by. My hope is that these statements of strength will help encourage you, lift you, and add value to you as we go through this together.</p>

<p>Today’s statement comes from a quote from Helen Keller. Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.</p>

<p>What’s special about this statement is that Helen Keller was deaf and blind. She was an overcomer. She had many reasons to not succeed, but she did.</p>

<p>I’d encourage you during this difficult time to listen to overcomers. All around us we have people who have been overcome and we also have those who overcame... who you listen to will determine your response to this crisis. Find some overcomers and listen to them... they’ll tell you it’s dark, it’s difficult, it’s not easy... but you can overcome it and you’ll be stronger because of it.</p>

<p>Have a great day Fairview Family!</p>

<p>JRS</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hand Sanitizer Distribution</strong></p>

<p>Westwood and Boyd Co Community,</p>

<p>The distribution will be tonight, Monday, March 30, 2020 from 6:00-7:00.</p>

<p>The safety of our students, educators, and community is our number one priority. When we left for the extended closure on March 13th, we had a large amount of hand sanitizer in the district.</p>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>We believe it isn’t right to hold onto this stock pile when there is a great need in our community, as we will not be returning to school until it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Many community members do not have hand sanitizer at this time due to the stock at stores being depleted quickly a couple of weeks ago and although community members are staying healthy at home and hand wash frequently, many still are required to leave their home for work, grocery shopping, and other activity that has been noted by our governor as essential.</p>

<p>There is also a short supply among many businesses, including healthcare facilities. We have reached out to these. We have shared our supply with businesses and healthcare facilities in need.</p>

<p>As our supply is almost gone and this is a great need of our community members, our educators want to share hand sanitizer with our community members in need as well.</p>

<p>This weekend, we put together, with gloved hands, 300 3 Fl. oz bottles of hand sanitizer. These will be passed out in the drive-thru we have set up on the cafeteria side of FHS today, Monday, March 30, 2020, from 6:00-7:00 tonight until gone.</p>

<p>If you are in need of a bottle, please pull up through the drive-thru, DO NOT exit your vehicle, roll down your window, and one will be brought to your car. Although all of our educator team would be willing to help out, only our superintendent will be passing it out to keep everyone safe at home. She will be doing so while wearing a mask, gloves, and following appropriate social distancing guidelines. We share this because we ask that you please be understanding if it takes a few minutes and follow the guidelines as directed in this post and do not exit your vehicle. Please only come out if this is a true need and please stay safe and healthy in your vehicle when picking it up.</p>

<p>Our educators hope by doing just this small act during these challenging times in our community that we can make a difference in keeping everyone healthy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Attention Parents and Families of Students in Grades 3-5...</strong></p>

<p>Parents and Families of students in grades 3-5 who pick up NTI work for days 11-20 this Friday, March 27, 2020, will also be picking up a chrome book for student use during the school closure and for NTI assignments on days 11-20. NTI day 11 starts on April 6, 2020 after spring break.</p>

<p>Students receiving school meal delivery will receive their Chromebooks by delivery with their meals on Monday, April 6, 2020. If stud<span class="text_exposed_show">ents receive their NTI assignments this Friday during school meal delivery, they can still pick up a Chromebook through the drive-thru next to the FMS/FHS cafeteria until 2:00 PM this Friday.</span></p>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Students who do not pick up their NTI assignments this Friday, as it is not required that you pick them up, and students who receive home meal delivery, will receive Chromebooks after we return April 6, 2020 from spring break. A process for getting those to the students will be announced at a later time. Again, every student in grades 3-5 has the option of picking up a Chromebook in the drive-thru this Friday.</p>

<p>We recognize that not every student has internet access at home. Students who do not have internet access at home will still be be provided a Chromebook for home use and will be able to do work on paper. Paper copies will go to all students, internet access or not. Currently, teachers are gathering information on the number of their students who do not have internet access so that we can make decisions based on these numbers and look at possible resources and options to address this need. We’re aware that Spectrum has offered free internet but unfortunately there are conditions included that will still result in it not being an option for all students.</p>

<p>We are working on plans as quickly as possible and will communicate as they are finalized. Your flexibility, understanding, and teamwork is valued greatly at this time as we work to give each and every student the best learning opportunities possible. <a class="_58cn" data-ft='{"type":104,"tn":"*N"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/teamfairview?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA0BQ-IK8-zMmragLBZcGNsZsWFo0sVS8k5aR1vVLajA5N4wSYzG-eep07UxSrKucirprFr9ix8v8UxigRUnNthM9BTuq1pr7iKDbhiRmCOFlUUW0FjSz2Vk58Gxlu2X9YPyot00I7wVftitDmNbDq0MEOu9sKrOn5QUzXkV6QUWlfoo9RYVI-yskwImYNrWWz9uyWQK0DlFt6MxtEhaPO_3atlgm1ORPRpktj2ICgfAk6KbkncyxOq7uUUCf8ojsDWZ1s-zJWC6l32yjFPi9fRex7Ly49fG92HAsQtcFI-tS7zFBwBV9TUl7KTPYgW9RXGb3tAiS4-_Sd8X7W48XPQe_8oceexdKoACthFFdEdt-Vn90ZkJWdJrgEXkpBB7tze4a-fxw_clbuiGHZaR2--ru8JcruHo7ttnnJ7E0nuI-vyrU03ai5w2INKTrgBoNgroAIjiXdMiXzfnGWGMsUmyv8OdORIb8JluefUIUi3x5epziM&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R"><span class="_5afx"><span aria-label="hashtag" class="_58cl _5afz">#</span><span class="_58cm">TeamFairview</span></span></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Please see the attached letter for an announcement and communication of important information.</strong></p>

<p>Dear Fairview Students, Educators, Families, and Community,</p>

<p>In a conference call with Governor Beshear at 3:30 today, he recommended that all superintendents extend the cease of in-person classes through April 17, 2020. It is in the best interest of our students, staff, families, and community that I close school in our district through April 17, 2020, with a plan to return April 20, 2020 at this time.</p>

<p>In a meeting with staff last Friday, I explained that my focus would be on two priorities during this time:<br>
1) Doing everything possible to keep our students, staff, families, and community safe<br>
2) Continuing the efficient and effective operation of our school district during this extended closure</p>

<p>I explained to our educators that in order to maintain focus on these priorities, their flexibility, understanding, and teamwork would be crucial. The staff of Fairview have done exactly as expected and have went above and beyond what was asked of them. They should be commended for their flexibility, understanding, and teamwork during these challenging times. WE, as a TEAM, will continue to do everything that we can to provide the best for our students.</p>

<p>Regardless of the role that you have as part of the “Fairview Family”, you are an important part of our team and your flexibility, understanding, and teamwork are valued greatly. Beyond the challenges you face in general during these times of uncertainty, you also have the challenge of being in the role of a student, parent, educator, and community. Each of these roles come with their own challenges, but we will get through this together as a team. We will keep our focus on taking care of one another. That is how families stay strong regardless of how hard the challenge they face. Thank you for your continued commitment to maintain focus on what matters most.</p>

<p>I want to share some updates everyone in our Fairview Family will need to be aware of at this time. I understand this type of communication tends to be lengthy, however I will include the details necessary.</p>

<p>NTI Days</p>

<p>Our district’s application for emergency Non-Traditional Instruction (NTI) days has been approved. Last night, SB 177 passed to allow additional NTI days to be approved for districts by the Kentucky Department of Education. In addition to the importance of students completing their NTI assignments for learning, student participation in completing assignments is a crucial component necessary for our district to receive approval to not make up the day at a later date. Students must be completing their NTI assignments.</p>

<p>At this time, closure through April 17, 2020, with a return on April 20, 2020, will result in 20 NTI days in our district. A plan will be initiated next week for our district’s continued support of home instruction so that students, educators, families, and our community have what is needed for Monday, April 6, 2020 when we return from our scheduled spring break from March 30, 2020 through April 3, 2020. This plan, including all of the details you will need to know, will be communicated with you after finalized next week.</p>

<p>Student Meal Feeding Plan</p>

<p>We will continue to serve students breakfast and lunch next week, March 23, 2020 through March 27, 2020. At this time, we will not serve meals during our scheduled spring break, March 30, 2020 through April 3, 2020. We will resume serving meals when the district returns from spring break on April 6, 2020.</p>

<p>We have requested and received the necessary approval to deliver breakfast and lunch at the same time and for both breakfast and lunch to be picked up at the same time in our drive-thru. This allows us to adjust our serving times. Our drive-thru will be open from 9:00 AM until 12:30 PM daily next week and our home delivery will be exactly one hour earlier than it has been this week. Additional details of our feeding plan during closure remain the same and can be found on our website and on our Facebook page. If you need breakfast and lunch delivery and you did not receive lunch delivery this week, please call the Central Office at 606-324-3877. You only need to call us if you did not receive delivery this week and want to be added to the delivery list.</p>

<p>School and Facility Closure</p>

<p>Our schools and facilities are now closed to students, staff, and the community and it is not permissible for you to be in our schools and facilities at this time without my prior approval. The safety of our students, staff, families, and community is my number one priority.</p>

<p>Educator work plans have been developed to include the presence of staff in our district, when absolutely necessary, to result in the efficient and effective operation of our district during this closure. These plans have been developed individually and strategically based on need and with the safety of staff being my number one priority. That said, educators will rarely be present but when they are present in our schools and district facilities, they are not allowed to open the doors to visitors. They will be following strict processes to keep them safe and our students and community safe. In a small community, it is important that I address this because many people know the cars of educators and may stop when they see a car present. Staff are not allowed to open the door to you. I want you to know that they are following a directive from me and it isn’t that they don’t want to interact with you or that they are being rude or inconsiderate. Our school facilities are closed. If you stop at any of our schools or facilities, you will not be allowed to enter. One person will be at the Central Office daily and can answer questions or forward your call as needed. The Central Office phone number is 606-324-3877. Due to the need for me to be accessible to everyone during these times with limiting staff presence in the district, I want to provide you a cell phone number where you can reach me directly. You are welcome to text or call 606-386-4264 when necessary. It is very important that you leave a voicemail or text if you call and I do not answer. It is almost impossible to monitor missed calls, but easier to monitor texts and voicemails. I will not return your call if I do not answer and you do not leave a voicemail or text. Please be considerate and only contact me when necessary and attempt to first contact the teacher, principal, administrator, or Central Office as appropriate.</p>

<p>Drive-thru to Support Efficient Operations During the Closure</p>

<p>We have put in place a drive-thru at FMS/FHS for situations where items must be dropped up or picked up to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of our district. Some examples of this include chromebooks that aren’t working, picking up checks, dropping off required documents, etc. Visitors coming through the drive-thru should not exit their vehicle. An assigned educator will be at the drive-thru and will come out to your vehicle wearing safety gear including a mask and gloves. They will maintain social distancing requirements as well. Drive-thru visits should be made by appointment only and should be made by calling the Central Office at 606-324-3877. The drive-thru is open from<br>
9:00 AM – 12:30 PM. Again, all schools and district facilities are closed and cannot be entered without my permission.</p>

<p>I will continue to update you with communication from the district as new information becomes available. These updates will be on our website and on Facebook, and when appropriate, in a letter such as this. Thank you for your flexibility, understanding, and teamwork. Together, we will get through this and our Fairview Family will be stronger because of it. Do not hesitate to reach out to me if needed.</p>

Future Focused,</p>

<p>The Fairview Independent School District Feeding Plan for the COVID 19 School Closure is attached. It has also been posted below for reading clarity. We have two options available for parents/guardians to choose from:</p>

<p>1) Delivery to all Fairview enrolled students residing in the Westwood Community, and 2) Drive-thru service with food pick up.</p>

<p>Drive-thru service with food pick up is available to any school-aged child, regardless of where they are enrolled in school. Participation is NOT based on income. All families are encouraged to participate and not see this as an income-based support.</p>

<p>There is a lot of important information in the plan below. Please review closely.</p>

<p>Fairview Independent School District<br>
COVID 19 School Closure<br>
Student Feeding Plan</p>

<p>The Fairview Independent School District will be serving FREE breakfast and lunch to all school-aged students during the school closure starting Tuesday, March 17, 2020. Participation is NOT based on income. All families are encouraged to participate and not see this as an income-based support. Due to federal funding we applied for yesterday and just got approved for today, we will receive reimbursement based on the number of meals served. This reimbursement supports our efforts with this work so it is important that you know that your participation is not an added expense on our district.</p>

<p>In order to meet SFSP guidelines set by the USDA, we must hand the breakfast and lunch directly to the student.</p>

<p>Students receiving breakfast or lunch during the school closure may do so through one of the two following options:</p>

<p>1) Breakfast and Lunch drive-thru set up at FMS/FHS – Someone will be outside to assist with lineup the first few days. ALL MEALS WILL BE SERVED OUT OF FMS/FHS ONLY.</p>

<p>2) Lunch delivery ONLY to Fairview Independent School District students residing in the Westwood Community. We cannot deliver outside of the Westwood Community, however school-aged students, regardless of their enrollment at Fairview, are eligible for FREE breakfast and lunch through the drive-thru.</p>

<p>We have created a plan for lengthy periods of time serving breakfast and lunch to better serve our community.</p>

<p>Breakfast from 7:30 – 9:30</p>

<p>Lunch from 10:00 – 1:30</p>

<p>Drive-thru Service</p>

<p>Students who are participating in breakfast or lunch drive-thru do not need to do anything in advance to enroll and should simply arrive at the cafeteria side of FMS/FHS and enter the drive-thru during the times outlined above.</p>

<p>Delivery Service</p>

<p>Lunch will be delivered to homes between the hours of 10:30-11:30 daily. It is important to watch for the delivery during these times.</p>

<p>Students who are participating in lunch only delivery will need to be ready to come out and get their lunch when the bus arrives with the same time expectations that are in place when they ride the bus in the mornings. The bus cannot wait longer than a few seconds for the students to come out.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, staff will follow every transportation route and stop at locations on the bus route just as they would be picking up students for school. On Wednesday and every day M-F thereafter, staff will only stop at locations on the bus route if the student participated the day before. In other words, on Tuesday, we will attempt to deliver lunch to all students who ride the bus to or from school but will take all students not participating off of the list for Wednesday and every day (M-F) thereafter.</p>

<p>To be added back to the list or to be added to the list on specific days only, please call the central office at 606-324-3877 between 9:30-10:00 the day of and ask to speak with Mrs. Terri Hood or Mrs. LeighAnn Jobe and added to the lunch delivery list for that day. The call must be made between 9:30-10:00 the day of the requested delivery if the student did not participate the day prior. It is not necessary to call and be added to the list if the student participated the day prior.</p>

<p>Students who attend the Fairview Independent School District but do not ride the bus, may participate in lunch delivery during the school closure but will need to call and request to be added to the list. Please call the central office between 9:30-10:00 the day of and ask to speak with Mrs. Terri Hood or Mrs. LeighAnn Jobe.</p>

<p>Again, if you currently ride the bus to or from school, you do not have to call to participate in this program. Staff will arrive on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In an effort to protect the safety of our students, staff, and community, food service staff will be wearing face masks and gloves at all times throughout this process. Our facilities are completely shutdown to visitors. Those using the drive-thru should not exit their cars or enter the building.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Corona Virus Video for Children</strong></p>

<p>Many children are likely struggling with worry right now. Sometimes they do not express this worry in their communication with adults, nevertheless it is present. Families, check out this video and consider sharing it with children to help them better understand what is going on.</p>

<p>On the typical school day, our educators are doing a great deal of work beyond instruction in the classroom. Currently, we are working on a plan to support the mental health of students we know may struggle during this school closure. This will likely include individual contacts by our educators and an opportunity for students to reach out if needed. We’re addressing this as quickly as possible and planning is currently in development... look for more information to come out from our district Monday.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Information Regarding COVID 19</strong></p>

<p>Dear Fairview Families,</p>

<p>During a press conference yesterday with Governor Beshear and Interim Kentucky Department of Education Commissioner Brown, school district superintendents were advised that we should be prepared to close our districts with only a 72 hour notice.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>During a press conference that commenced at 5:00 PM today. Governor Beashear and Interim Kentucky Department of Education Commissioner Brown recommended that all superintendents “cease in-person classes effective Monday, March 16, 2020.” They clarified that their recommendation included the wording to cease “in-person classes” to allow for school cafeterias to remain open to serve meals if districts choose to do so. Options for serving meals that do not require students to gather in the cafeteria were discussed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Fairview Independent School District will not be in session Monday, March 16, 2020 through April 3, 2020. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is extremely important that students be in attendance tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020. Tomorrow evening, I am making the recommendation to our board of education that our district submit an emergency non-traditional instruction (NTI) application. The emergency NTI application has been made available for districts to apply and use up to 10 NTI days due to this unforeseen situation. NTI will allow for students to complete work at home while they are out of school. In turn, missed days of school do not have to be made up in the school district’s calendar. Our educators have spent yesterday and today working diligently to develop the assignments for up to 10 days of NTI. These assignments will be given to students to bring home tomorrow. It is extremely important that your child attend school tomorrow. Not only will tomorrow be a day of quality instruction in our district, but students will also need to be at school to receive the NTI materials. Additional information related to NTI will be provided to parents and families tomorrow. As a reminder, we will have in place all of the preventative measures established by the CDC tomorrow, just as we have all week. There have not been any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our community.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The press conference ended moments ago and I want to get this communication out to you as quickly as possible. I will send out additional follow-up communication within the next 48 hours.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Jackie Risden-Smith</p>

<p>Superintendent, Fairview Independent Schools   </p>
