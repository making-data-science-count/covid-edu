                                        <h1>Campus Health Notice: Coronavirus</h1>
<img alt="CDC Coronavirus illustration" class="float-right" height="168" src="../../images/2020-02-coronavirus.jpg" width="300"><p><em>Updated: April 27, 2020 @ 9:15 am</em></p>
<p>With all that is going on in the world, we want you to know that we care about you and your health and safety. We are committed to doing what we can to help you be successful during these unusual and unprecedented times.</p>
<p>Please carefully look through the <a href="#faq">FAQ section of this page</a> for the most updated details on campus operations, academics, events, and travel.</p>
<p>As announced on April 3, we received confirmation that a student at Southern Utah University has tested positive for COVID-19. <a href="../04/campus-update-4-3.html">Read the full email sent to the campus community here</a>.</p>
<p>Some important campus updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>All instruction for Spring 2020 (including final exams, science labs, etc.) will be delivered <strong>remotely</strong>. The only exception will be for one-on-one flight instruction.</li>
<li>
<strong>We encourage all students who are able to transition to their hometown and permanent residence where home conditions allow</strong>. We recognize that some students may need to stay in Cedar City for work reasons, safety reasons, or because this is your permanent residence. However, in advance of potential travel restrictions being placed on us by the State of Utah, and for overall health reasons, we strongly encourage all students (who are able) to return to their permanent residence.</li>
<li>In an effort to help students who are adjusting to the temporary online delivery of classes, all students will have the option of either receiving a letter grade or a <a href="../04/faq-pass-no-credit.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pass/No-Credit (P/NC) grade</a> for Spring 2020 classes.</li>
<li>We have decided, like all other universities in Utah, to plan for <a href="../04/summer-semester-update.html">all summer classes to be offered remotely</a>. We cannot forecast when we will be able to shift back from remote instruction to regular face-to-face classrooms and hope this will help you make your plans for the summer.</li>
<li>We are excited to announce Southern Utah University’s commencement and graduation events have been <strong>tentatively rescheduled for Saturday, August 8, 2020</strong>. This was the overwhelming choice of the Class of 2020 and a direct result of your suggestions and input. <a href="../03/commencement-update.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Read President Wyatt's email to campus here</a>.</li>
<li>
<span>ALL campus resources and services remain ready to serve you remotely. To help you know how to contact these offices, we have created this </span><a href="../03/campus-resources.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resource list</a><span> with all the information you need.</span>
</li>
<li><span>SUU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is facilitating <a href="../03/caps-update.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drop-in virtual discussion groups</a> to help students survive and thrive during these challenging times. </span></li>
<li>The Student Center and student housing will remain open. Food Services will be available in Thunderbird Circle, the cafeteria located in the Student Center. Other dining options in the Student Center will be closed for the rest of the semester.</li>
<li>All faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to <strong>conduct their work virtually</strong>. Some individuals may be able to do so working from home while others may prefer to come to campus and work privately in their offices. Exceptions include academic college and department offices, as well as individuals who must interact with the public in a face-to-face manner. </li>
</ul>
<p>The health, safety, and well-being of everyone on our campus and community is our relentless priority at all times. COVID-19 is already proving to be an unprecedented disruption and this extraordinary move is being made to try and prevent the spread of the coronavirus throughout SUU, Cedar City, and Utah. With the rapidly evolving nature of the disease, the landscape is continually shifting, and we will do our best to communicate with you as decisions are being made.</p>
<p>We’re taking these steps for three reasons: to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff and Cedar City neighbors, to slow the potential spread of the virus, and to ensure the continuity of our core mission - educating our students.</p>

                No, there are very limited in-person services available on campus and it will remain that way through the rest of the semester. Most offices and many buildings are closed as faculty and staff have begun working remotely. However, everyone still stands ready to help, as we always do, but now we are connecting via video chats, phone calls, and emails rather than in person. As a University, we are following the instructions from our Governor and taking our responsibility very seriously to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to keep everyone healthy.

                No colleges or universities in the state of Utah are offering any sort of refund of tuition and fee dollars for the spring semester. We certainly understand students may be frustrated with this change in instruction. Asking faculty and students to transition from face-to-face learning to remote instruction is an unprecedented scenario. We've never done it at this scale, nor have any other universities around the country. Hopefully we can all do our best to work together to maintain a positive learning environment, even though it is not the ideal learning modality for everyone. Faculty have a number of options to deliver their courses. Among those options is to deliver lectures and engage in discussions through videoconferencing. While this is not the same as a classroom discussion, learning in this way is a valuable professional skill. We're asking that all students do their best under these trying circumstances. We recognize this is certainly not ideal, but if we work together, we can ensure that you'll have the opportunity to accomplish your educational goals.

                All custodial managers have been trained and refreshed on high touch-point cleaning practices, which include handrails, chair arms, doorknobs, light switches, elevator buttons, etc. and use Green Solutions Neutral Disinfectant for cleaning. Custodial Services has ordered and stocked extra quantities of restroom soap and paper towels, anticipating increased use rates of these products. Soap and hot water hand washing have been recommended by the WHO as the primary cleaning method for hand sanitation. If large-scale decontamination is needed, Facilities will contract with ServPro, an emergency mitigation and restoration service provider, to handle disinfection and cleaning in the case of viral contamination.

                No. No colleges or universities in the state of Utah are offering any sort of refund of tuition and fee dollars for the spring semester. We certainly understand students may be frustrated with this change in instruction. Asking faculty and students to transition from face-to-face learning to remote instruction is an unprecedented scenario. We've never done it at this scale, nor have any other universities around the country. Hopefully we can all do our best to work together to maintain a positive learning environment, even though it is not the ideal learning modality for everyone. Faculty have a number of options to deliver their courses. Among those options is to deliver lectures and engage in discussions through videoconferencing. While this is not the same as a classroom discussion, learning in this way is a valuable professional skill. We're asking that all students do their best under these trying circumstances. We recognize this is certainly not ideal, but if we work together, we can ensure that you'll have the opportunity to accomplish your educational goals.

                Yes. If SUU cancels a study abroad program, students will receive a full refund of the fees they paid to SUU for that study abroad program. If students booked flights directly with airlines, SUU cannot offer refunds for such expenses, but many airlines are being unusually flexible with ticket changes due to the coronavirus situation. In the event a study abroad program is canceled, we recommend that students work with their airline or travel agent to get a refund or credit toward a future flight.

                <p>As a student who is currently studying abroad with an exchange program, your status and travel are different from students who travel with SUU faculty chaperones as part of SUU-sponsored programs. While still enrolled at SUU for credit, you also have a formal connection to another university that has some responsibilities for your education, safety and welfare. We also recognize that you are independent adults with authority over your travel decisions. That being said, SUU still wants you to know that we are concerned for you and want you to exercise caution and wisdom in doing what is best for you.</p>
<p>The current guidelines and recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. State Department, and the Utah Department of Health are that any US student who is currently abroad should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">consider returning to the USA</a>. SUU takes guidance from these entities very seriously and, based upon this guidance, joins in recommending that you consider returning to the US at this time.</p>
<p>At this time, it is SUU’s understanding that this national guidance is not mandatory, although we encourage you to continue to monitor all relevant and evolving guidance on these issues that could impact you.</p>

                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others circulating among animals including camels, cats and bats.</p>
<p>There are several known coronaviruses that infect people and usually only cause mild respiratory disease, such as the common cold. However, at least two previously identified coronaviruses have caused severe disease — severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been ruled out as the cause of the current outbreak.</p>
<p>While originally thought to spread from animal to person, recently, there have been indications that person-to-person spread is occurring in China and affected countries.</p>
<p>The infectious period for this virus is unknown. Based on other coronaviruses, people infected with COVID-19 should be considered to be contagious from the day of fever onset until 10 days after fever ends, or until appropriate laboratory testing shows the patient is no longer contagious.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses typically have an incubation period of 2‒14 days after exposure. The specific incubation period for this coronavirus is unknown.</p>
