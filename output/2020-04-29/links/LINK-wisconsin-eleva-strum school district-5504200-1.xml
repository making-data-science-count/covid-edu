We would like to thank all them for taking time out of their days and for making this learning experience such a great annual event.  Enjoy some photos of the day.

                              It's been two years since our 4th and 5th graders have had a REAL playground to enjoy.  THAT has changed and it is exciting!   Instead of heading out to an empty lot to play catch, tag, or chase games our 4th and 5th graders are now enjoying the new playground that has been placed right next to their NEW School.  Check out a few snap shots of the Fun!!

One of the best parts is that it is contagious and Mrs. McSorley was infected from head to toe, literally, and was all out Pink for our Friday morning meeting!  What a great sport and inspiration...
