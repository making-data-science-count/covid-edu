<!-- All in One SEO Pack 3.2.9 by Michael Torbert of Semper Fi Web Design[1352,1432] --><meta name="description" content="(Updated Information March 24, 2020) Dear School District of the City of York families: On Monday, March 23, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf extended the state-mandated closure of Pennsylvania schools. After consultation with the Superintendents from York County, realizing the interconnectedness of our districts, and the commitment to keeping health and wellness a top priority, we have collectively made the determination to extend the closure for students. Given this new information please know that we are preparing for the possibility of providing education online to our students. At this time the district is building a plan to ensure the continuity of education. This plan is to include the option for online school-work. The first step in the plan is to ensure that we have the technology available for our students. If your child(ren) has access to a tablet, laptop, or computer at home, your family is capable of online learning. If you do not have Internet access, see below information on how to access the internet Xfinity has provided information on FREE WiFi access throughout our county during this time. Visit to locate a &quot;hotspot.&quot; Please note that these hotspots are not home-based, and will be accessible at various locations throughout the county. You do not need to have an Xfinity account or service to access the hotspot WiFi! Enter your zip code to find one near you, and follow the process to enable devices and access the free hotspot. Also, please check with your cellular device provider for any updates that could pertain to your cell-phone plan in regards to internet and device usage. To further ensure this information gets to you in multiple ways, the district has launched a mobile app. Visit your app store (android and iphone) and type &quot;York City School District&quot; it should be the first option at the top Download the app to your device and ensure the notifications are on Check this app frequently for up-to-date information in the &quot;News&quot; section We also encourage you to check our website, facebook, and twitter often, as the same information will be provided using those platforms. Please know our district staff in essential roles have been and will continue to work remotely throughout this week and beyond. Our food services staff and volunteers continue to provide meals to our students at three locations in the District (William Penn door 15, Goode door 15, Ferguson door 6). We have served hundreds of students, and plan to do so throughout the remainder of the closure. All other offices and schools will continue to be closed, and we ask that you honor the closure We will continue providing you with updates on this situation as it relates to the School District of the City of York. Thank you for your continued support as we navigate new territory with rapidly changing circumstances. There are many unanswered questions, and we know this can cause uncertainty and concern for ALL. We are preparing to continue providing education for our students and want to reassure you that we will keep working on the way forward, together. Sincerely, Andrea J. Berry, Ed.D. Superintendent of Schools ____________________________________________________________________________________ (Updated information March 20, 2020) As we are coming to the end of our first week of this state-mandated 10-day closure the School District of the City of York would like to provide our parents, faculty, and staff with an update. Please be aware that all of this information provided is subject to change at any time. Pennsylvania Department of Education Update The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) announced on March 19, 2020, the cancellation of all PSSA testing and Keystone exams for the 2019-2020 school year as a result of COVID-19. This includes the Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment (PASA). Talking with your Kids/Teens About The Coronavirus The Centers for Disease Control has many resources available on helping children cope with anxiety or stress-related to this issue. Their mental health experts have provided the following tips for parents/guardians to help support your child throughout this time. Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand. Reassure your child or teen that they are safe. Let them know it is ok if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you. Limit your family's exposure to news coverage of the event, including social media. Children may misinterpret what they hear and can be frightened about something they do not understand. Try to keep up with regular routines. Create a schedule for learning activities and relaxing or fun activities. Be a role model. Take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well. Connect with your friends and family members They also have a site dedicated to helping children cope with emergencies and disasters, which offers age-specific guidance. Click here to view that site: The School District of the City of York has answered some commonly asked questions as a result of the state-mandated closure below. Please be aware that all of this information provided is subject to change at any time. How Long is the Closure? We are closed through Friday, March 27, 2020. Why Are We Not Giving School Work During This Time? We are closed by decree of the state, we are not permitted to offer educational programming for the 10-day period. This closure also extends to all Bearcat Cyber and all public cyber schools. We are monitoring the situation and, if we would need to extend the closure beyond 10 days, we will revisit the option to use alternative educational options. Will We Have To Make Up These Days? As of March 20, 2020, our guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Education is that we are not required to make up the days missed during this time. The days will not impact our graduation date and they do not impact our last day of school. Do We Have a New Date for Graduation? As of March 20, 2020, Our graduation date has not been changed at this time, as the 10-day closure does not need to be &quot;made up&quot; and at this point does not have an impact on our calendar. Does the 3rd-Marking Period Still End on March 25, 2020? There has been no change to that date as of today, March 20, 2020. What Should I Expect of My Child's Teacher During the Closure? This is a mandated state closure. Therefore, all student instruction has been suspended. We are monitoring the situation and are continuing to reach out to the Pennsylvania Department of Education for additional guidance. Additional district-wide communication will be distributed when necessary and/or new information is available to share with our school community. What Extra-Curricular Activities are Cancelled? During the 10-day closure, no activities – athletic, music or otherwise – will be held. We will reevaluate guidance as it comes available and provide information on what to expect following the closure at that time What About PSSAs and Keystone Exams? All Pennsylvania state assessments have been cancelled How Will This Impact Registration? We encourage that you utilize the online registration process. You can register online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by clicking on this link: At the end of the application, you will be required to submit scans or photographs of required documentation (residency verification, birth certificates, and shot records). Upon verification, your registration will be accepted, and you will be contacted when your student(s) can begin attendance in the York City SD. If you are unable to upload documents you will be contacted about coming to the central administration building to provide the documents once the mandated closure is lifted. Students should not report to a York City school until they receive confirmation from the central registration department about their start date. Will Breakfast and Lunch Still Be Provided During The Closure? As of March 20, 2020, students are able to receive lunch and breakfast for the next morning at William Penn Senior High School Door 15, Goode K-8 Door 15, and Ferguson K-8 Door 6, from 11:00 AM- 1 PM, Monday through Friday.

                    <p>(Updated Information March 24, 2020)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear School District of the City of York families: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, March 23, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf extended the state-mandated closure of Pennsylvania schools. After consultation with the Superintendents from York County, realizing the interconnectedness of our districts, and the commitment to keeping health and wellness a top priority, we have collectively made the determination to extend the closure for students. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this new information please know that we are preparing for the possibility of providing education online to our students.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time the district is building a plan to ensure the continuity of education. This plan is to include the option for online school-work. The first step in the plan is to ensure that we have the technology available for our students. If your child(ren) has access to a tablet, laptop, or computer at home, your family is capable of online learning. </span></p>
<p><strong> If you do not have Internet access, see below information on how to access the internet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xfinity has provided information on FREE WiFi access throughout our county during this time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit </span><a href="https://wifi.xfinity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://wifi.xfinity.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to locate a “hotspot.” Please note that these hotspots are not home-based, and will be accessible at various locations throughout the county. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not need to have an Xfinity account or service to access the hotspot WiFi!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter your zip code to find one near you, and follow the process to enable devices and access the free hotspot.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, please check with your cellular device provider for any updates that could pertain to your cell-phone plan in regards to internet and device usage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further ensure this information gets to you in multiple ways, the district has launched a mobile app.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit your app store (android and iphone) and type “York City School District” it should be the first option at the top</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download the app to your device and ensure the notifications are on</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check this app frequently for up-to-date information in the “News” section</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also encourage you to check our website, facebook, and twitter often, as the same information will be provided using those platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please know </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">our district staff in essential roles have been and will continue to work remotely throughout this week and beyond.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our food services staff  and volunteers continue to provide meals to our students at three locations in the District (William Penn door 15, Goode door 15, Ferguson door 6). We have served hundreds of students, and plan to do so throughout the remainder of the closure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All other offices and schools will continue to be closed, and we ask that you honor the closure</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will continue providing you with updates on this situation as it relates to the School District of the City of York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your continued support as we navigate new territory with rapidly changing circumstances. There are many unanswered questions, and we know this can cause uncertainty and concern for ALL. We are preparing to continue providing education for our students and want to reassure you that we will keep working on the way forward, together.</span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Andrea J. Berry, Ed.D.</p>
<p>Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p>(Updated information March 20, 2020)</p>
<p>As we are coming to the end of our first week of this state-mandated 10-day closure the School District of the City of York would like to provide our parents, faculty, and staff with an update. Please be aware that all of this information provided is subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><strong><u>Pennsylvania Department of Education Update</u><u><br></u></strong>The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) announced on March 19, 2020, the cancellation of all PSSA testing and Keystone exams for the 2019-2020 school year as a result of COVID-19. This includes the Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment (PASA).</p>
<p><strong><u>Talking with your Kids/Teens About The Coronavirus</u></strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control has many resources available on helping children cope with anxiety or stress-related to this issue. Their mental health experts have provided the following tips for parents/guardians to help support your child throughout this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/share-facts.html">share facts</a> about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.</li>
<li>Reassure your child or teen that they are safe. Let them know it is ok if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you.</li>
<li>Limit your family’s exposure to news coverage of the event, including social media. Children may misinterpret what they hear and can be frightened about something they do not understand.</li>
<li>Try to keep up with regular routines. Create a schedule for learning activities and relaxing or fun activities.</li>
<li>Be a role model.  Take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well. Connect with your friends and family members</li>
</ul>
<p>They also have a site dedicated to helping children cope with emergencies and disasters, which offers age-specific guidance. Click here to view that site: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html">https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html</a><u><br></u></p>
<p>The School District of the City of York has answered some commonly asked questions as a result of the state-mandated closure below. Please be aware that all of this information provided is subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><strong><u>How Long is the Closure? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are closed through Friday, March 27, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Why Are We Not Giving School Work During This Time? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are closed by decree of the state, we are not permitted to offer educational programming for the 10-day period. This closure also extends to all Bearcat Cyber and all public cyber schools. We are monitoring the situation and, if we would need to extend the closure beyond 10 days, we will revisit the option to use alternative educational options.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Will We Have To Make Up These Days? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As of March 20, 2020, our guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Education is that we are not required to make up the days missed during this time.  The days will not impact our graduation date and they do not impact our last day of school.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Do We Have a New Date for Graduation? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As of March 20, 2020, Our graduation date has not been changed at this time, as the 10-day closure does not need to be “made up” and at this point does not have an impact on our calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Does the 3<sup>rd</sup>-Marking Period Still End on March 25, 2020? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There has been no change to that date as of today, March 20, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>What Should I Expect of My Child’s Teacher During the Closure? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a mandated state closure. Therefore, all student instruction has been suspended. We are monitoring the situation and are continuing to reach out to the Pennsylvania Department of Education for additional guidance. Additional district-wide communication will be distributed when necessary and/or new information is available to share with our school community.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>What Extra-Curricular Activities are Cancelled? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the 10-day closure, no activities – athletic, music or otherwise – will be held. We will reevaluate guidance as it comes available and provide information on what to expect following the closure at that time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>What About PSSAs and Keystone Exams? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All Pennsylvania state assessments have been cancelled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>How Will This Impact Registration? </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We encourage that you utilize the online registration process.  You can register online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by clicking on this link:  <a href="https://ycssapphire1.k12system.com/CommunityWebPortal/Registration/index.cfm">https://ycssapphire1.k12system.com/CommunityWebPortal/Registration/index.cfm</a>
</li>
<li>At the end of the application, you will be required to submit scans or photographs of required documentation (residency verification, birth certificates, and shot records). Upon verification, your registration will be accepted, and you will be contacted when your student(s) can begin attendance in the York City SD. If you are unable to upload documents you will be contacted about coming to the central administration building to provide the documents once the mandated closure is lifted. Students should not report to a York City school until they receive confirmation from the central registration department about their start date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Will Breakfast and Lunch Still Be Provided During The Closure?</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As of March 20, 2020, students are able to receive lunch and breakfast for the next morning at William Penn Senior High School Door 15, Goode K-8 Door 15, and Ferguson K-8 Door 6, from 11:00 AM- 1 PM, Monday through Friday.</li>

<p>(Updated Information March 12, 2020)</p>
<p>Dear Bearcat Families, Faculty, and Staff,</p>
<p>I am writing to you because we value the health and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff. As you are aware, there are confirmed cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus) in Pennsylvania, but NOT in York county.</p>
<p><strong>There are NO reported cases of Coronavirus connected to our school district. </strong></p>
<p>We want you to know that our district is working with local, state and federal health agencies on prevention and district management in the event of an outbreak in our community. Our district follows local, state, and federal health care expert guidance and recommendations. We are sharing this information in the sake of transparency, so you are aware and can help reduce the spread of infection. The best ways to reduce the risk of getting this or <strong>any</strong> viral respiratory infection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces</li>
<li>Stay at home away from others if you are sick</li>
<li>Cover any cough or sneeze with your elbow, do not use your hands!</li>
<li>Do not bring your student to school or come to work at school if you have cold or flu-like symptoms (elevated temperature, fever, cough, shortness of breath)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>What can you do now?</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage students to stay home if they are sick with any illness</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects in the classroom and at home
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html">Follow CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfecting community facilities, such as schools.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>(Information Posted March 2, 2020)</p>
<p>Students and staff health, safety, and well-being are our highest priorities. With the recently elevated discussion regarding the <a title="Coronavirus" href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx">Coronavirus</a>, a respiratory illness first identified in China in December 2019; we want to reinforce best-practice preventative safety measures.</p>
<p><em>There are NO reported cases of Coronavirus connected to our school district.</em></p>
<p>This communication is meant to provide information, so you are aware of this issue, and so you are assured that the School District of the City of York has plans in place to monitor, prepare for and respond to any health or safety issue that may impact us. We also encourage you to use the <a title="Coronavirus" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">Centers for Disease Control</a> and the <a title="PA DOH" href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx">Pennsylvania Department of Public Health</a> as trusted resources on the latest updates and guidance concerning this health issue.</p>
<p>There are everyday actions you and your family can take to stay healthy – the same preventive strategies used during a typical cold and flu season. The Pennsylvania Department of Health recently shared guidelines for K-12 schools regarding preventative measures. The guidance included tips for reducing the spread of any illness among our community at this time, such as:</p>
<p>*Cover any coughs or sneezes with your elbow, do not use your hands!</p>
<p>*Clean surfaces frequently, such as countertops, light switches, cell phones, and other frequently touched areas. Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.</p>
<p>*Contain- Keep sick children home from school and limit their contact with others.</p>
<p>*Avoid touching your mouth, nose, eyes, and face after touching surfaces that are commonly shared</p>
<p>Our schools are cleaned and disinfected daily as part of ongoing custodial services. During a time of potential heightened illness, such as flu season, our staff enhances cleaning services and has plans in place to address areas in which higher incidents of illness may occur throughout that time.</p>
<p>The School District of the City of York is committed to the health and wellness of our students, faculty, and families. We will continue to follow all recommendations from federal, state and local health officials concerning the Coronavirus, and will continue to provide you with updates related to this issue. Additional information can also be found at the <a title="PA DOH" href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx">Pennsylvania Department of Public Health website</a>  or the <a title="Coronavirus" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">Centers for Disease Control website</a>  (CDC)</p>
