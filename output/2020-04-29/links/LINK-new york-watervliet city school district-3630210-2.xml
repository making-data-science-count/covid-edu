<a id="April3_update"></a>Update April 3</h2>
<h3>New instruction and learning</h3>
<p><em>(This message was sent to WCSD families via One Call Now email)</em></p>
<p>The ongoing COVID-19/Coronavirus public health emergency has challenged everyone in different ways. For educators, it has resulted in finding new ways to support our students while they are not in our classrooms. A longer than expected school closure – currently through at least April 14 – means at-home learning will continue during this time.</p>
<p>While we recognize that instruction will not be the same as in a traditional classroom, our goal is to make sure that students have opportunities to continue learning new material guided by their teachers to prepare for the return to school.</p>
<p>To support this, we have worked as a district and as part of a larger effort with the Capital Region BOCES and our many neighboring school districts to gather and/or develop high-quality, standards-based lessons and resources and a framework for at-home learning that will best meet the needs of all children. The new resources are curriculum-based with an emphasis on concepts and skills that are essential for future learning. These resources also offer flexibility for teachers to adapt lessons that are appropriate for their students.</p>
<p>As a region, we also worked together on reasonable expectations for at-home learning, given these less-than-ideal circumstances. This includes a reduction in the amount of time students spend on at-home learning each week, and simplified grading measures.</p>
<p>Our expectation is that at-home learning time (including time spent learning new material, watching video lessons, participating in class discussions and completing assigned work and activities) will occur within these recommended guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Grades K-2:</strong> 2.5 hours total per week for ELA and math, with an additional one hour per week for learning in PE, art and music (3.5 hours per week total)</li>
<li>
<strong>Grades 3-5:</strong> 4 hours total per week for ELA and math, with an additional one hour per week for learning in PE, art and music (5 hours per week total)</li>
<li>
<strong>Grades 6-8:</strong> 2 hours each per week for ELA, math, science and social studies, with an additional 2 hours per week for all other subject areas (10 hours per week total)</li>
<li>
<strong>Grades 9-12:</strong> 3 hours per week for each credit-bearing course (24 hours per week total)</li>
</ul>
<p>A daily condensed schedule will provide structure and routine for students and parents, while also giving students flexibility to work outside of scheduled times. (<a href="https://www.watervlietcityschools.org/april-3-update-on-instruction-and-learning/#Schedule_sampleK6">See a sample daily schedule</a>)</p>
<p>We will also suspend “formal” grading while our schools are closed. Instead, students will receive feedback in one the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Evidence of Learning</strong> = The student has demonstrated learning of essential curriculum based on what was taught and assigned.</li>
<li>
<strong>Not Yet Learned</strong> = The student has not completed an assignment, or work completed does not yet demonstrate learning of essential curriculum. The student will be given the opportunity to redo and resubmit work to demonstrate learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Watervliet Elementary School 2nd trimester achievement reports will include grades and student progress through March 16. The 3rd trimester achievement reports will include grades and student progress from our return date through the end of the year. No 3rd trimester interim reports will be given.</p>
<p>The Watervliet Junior/Senior High School 3rd quarter report cards will include grades and student progress through March 16. <strong>Students may submit make-up work that was due prior to March 16 by April 8 to be included in 3rd quarter report cards.</strong> The 4th quarter report cards will include grades and student progress from our return date through the end of the year. No 4th quarter interim reports will be given.</p>
<p>Our most important expectation for students is that they participate daily and connect with their teachers so that learning can continue. As parents and guardians, you are important partners and digital role models for your children to help them develop new routines to remain engaged in their learning during these unprecedented times.</p>
<p>Together, we can continue our mission of educating every student, every day!</p>
<p>We wish you and your families good health during these unprecedented times. Please remember that we are here to assist you and encourage you to reach out with any questions, concerns or needs.</p>

<h3>State suspends grades 3-8 testing, city parks &amp; playgrounds closed</h3>
<h4>NYS Grades 3-8 ELA and math assessments suspended</h4>
<p>The State Education Department announced Friday, March 20, that all statewide exams for students in elementary and middle school have been suspended for the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p>The state has suspended the following exams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grades 3-8 English Language Arts Tests</li>
<li>Grades 3-8 Mathematics Tests</li>
<li>Grade 4 Elementary-Level Science Test</li>

<li>Alternate Assessment for students with severe cognitive disabilities in Grades 3-8 and high school</li>
</ul>
<p>Board of Regents Chancellor Betty A. Rose and Interim Education Commissioner Shannon L. Tahoe said in a joint statement: “It is most important that during the time of closure, schools be able to continue to focus their efforts toward local school and community needs and not have to be concerned about preparing for state assessments.”</p>
<h3>A reminder about new Executive Order: NYS on PAUSE</h3>
<p>On Friday, March 20, Governor Cuomo issued a new Executive Order to “put New York State on PAUSE” (Policy to Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone) to help slow the spread of Coronavirus/COVID-19.</p>
<p>An essential part of this state directive is the restriction of all non-essential gatherings of any size for any reason (social events, parties, celebrations). City residents are asked to voluntarily comply with the order. Given that, we are reminding all community members and district families that as of Monday, March 23, <em>ALL</em> parks and recreational facilities are closed in the City of Watervliet until further notice. This closure includes our school athletic fields and track at Watervliet Jr.-Sr. High School, and our playgrounds at Watervliet Elementary School.</p>
<p>To help mitigate the spread of the illness, community members also are reminded to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain a minimum of 6-feet apart from each other;</li>
<li>Limit the use of public transportation to only when absolutely necessary; and</li>
<li>Stay home if you are sick, unless to receive medical care.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important reminders about free meals pick-up, building access</h3>
<p>A new directive from Governor Cuomo on March 20, mandates that 100% of the workforce stay home in an effort to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Only employees deemed critical to operations will be allowed in the workplace. For our schools, critical staff includes food service workers, maintenance/cleaning staff, and designated administrators.</p>

<p>While our schools are closed we want to make sure families who depend on the school breakfast and lunch program will continue to have access to food for their children. We plan to have both meals available beginning tomorrow – Tuesday, March 17 – for all students who are 18 and younger.</p>
<p>The meals will be available for pick up in the “grab and go” format from tables set up at the entrances to Watervliet Elementary School and the Watervliet Civic Center. When you arrive at the location, please look for the pick-up table. If driving, stay in your car and a staff member will bring the meals to you.</p>
<p>Our “Food is Fuel” program also will continue for families that normally participate. Supply bags will be available for pick up on Friday between 8-10 a.m. at the elementary school.</p>
<h4>School bus stops added as drop-off sites for free school meals</h4>
<p>In an effort to better meet the needs of our families, free meals will be available for pick up at several new locations in the City of Watervliet.</p>
<p>Starting Wednesday, March 25, Watervliet school bus drivers will deliver meals to 15 regular bus stops in the community for students and families to pick up. The buses will be at the locations beginning at 9 a.m., and will remain at each stop for several minutes to allow time for students to pick up their meals and also practice social distancing by remaining 6 feet from each other.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Support"></a>Additional support for students and families</h3>
<p>We encourage you to the extent possible to maintain a schedule and routine with your child and keep an eye on the amount of time they use technology and media to avoid excessive exposure to media coverage. Reassure children that they are safe and let them talk about their worries, share your own coping skills and add time in your day for stress relief.</p>
<p>Due to the closing of our schools, we are reaching out to our students and families to give additional support knowing that this is a difficult time. Our school counselors, social workers, and school psychologists are available via email throughout each day while we are closed. In addition, in the case of an emergency please see the following schedule of support staff who will be on call. You can reach out to our Student Support team using the email address<span> </span><a href="mailto:supportstaff2020@vlietschools.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">supportstaff2020@vlietschools.org</a>.

<h2>
<a id="March13_update"></a>UPDATE #2: Friday, March 13, 2020</h2>
<h3>No School for Students March 16-20</h3>
<p>This is an update on the rapidly evolving situation regarding COVID-19/Coronavirus. We continue to monitor all guidance from local, state and federal agencies.</p>
<p>At this time, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in our school district. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are joining with other area districts and closing school for students next week: March 16-20, 2020.</p>
<p>Teachers and staff should report to school as scheduled Monday, March 16 for Superintendent’s Conference Day.</p>
<p>This school closure is the most proactive and careful action we can take to help limit the spread of illness and to provide time to reassess the situation next week. The closure will also give our custodial and maintenance staff an opportunity to complete a deep cleaning of classrooms and common areas of our buildings, as well as disinfect school buses.</p>
<h3>School meals: Breakfast, lunch available March 17-20 to students</h3>
<p>In addition to education, schools provide vital support to our communities and the closure will have an impact on our families. To that end, our district will continue to make meals available to all students under the age of 18 starting Tuesday, March 17.</p>
<p>Students will be able to pick up a breakfast/lunch bag from 8-10 a.m. Tuesday through Friday at the following locations while the schools are closed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watervliet Elementary School, 2557 10th Avenue<br>
Watervliet Civic Center, 14th Street &amp; 1st Avenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may stop by either location to pick up meals. No forms or registration are required. The Food is Fuel program will be available for families who normally receive it. Students may pick up their food supply bags on Friday at the elementary school between 8-10 a.m.</p>
<h3>All school activities, sports practices canceled</h3>
<p>Given the closure, there will be no school activities or athletic events in the district the week of March 16-20. This includes spring sports practices. As an additional note, Capital Region BOCES Career &amp; Tech, Special Education, P-TECH and Pathways programs will not be operating during this time.<br>
As Gov. Andrew Cuomo stated during his press conference today, school superintendents have the ability to decide to close their school districts, and the superintendents of our region have made that determination.</p>
<p>The New York State Education Department continues to work with the governor’s office, the New York State Department of Health and the U.S. Department of Education to provide guidance to our schools around issues such as instructional time and test scheduling.</p>
<p>This situation is very fluid and could change as we continue to work with our local departments of health and New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>The most current and accurate information about the coronavirus can be found at <a href="http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus" rel="nofollow noreferrer">www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued patience and partnership as our district navigates the challenges brought about by coronavirus/COVID-19. We will continue to provide more information and updates via our One Call Now system and the district website.</p>

<p><strong>Musical postponed</strong><br>
In an abundance of caution, district officials have made the decision to postpone the weekend performances of Beauty and the Beast at WJSHS. New dates will be announced.</p>

<h2>
<a id="update_March12"></a>Update: Thursday, March 12, 2020</h2>
<p>Today, Governor Cuomo announced significant restrictions on large group gatherings in New York state. Although there are no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in our school district, in an abundance of caution, we have decided to implement proactive steps that may help us keep our schools open and continue to educate our students.</p>
<p>Therefore, effective immediately, we have suspended all field trips and community use of our facilities, as well as limited outside visitors to our buildings until further notice.</p>
<p>The WJSHS Drama Club’s presentation of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast will be performed tomorrow evening (Friday, March 13) and Saturday evening (March 14) ONLY. The Sunday (March 15) show is cancelled.</p>
<p>School events that take place outside of regular school hours are cancelled. This does not apply, however, to the ExTRA program’s homework help and extracurricular club activities, the grade 9 PIVOT program or the Civic Center’s after-school program at Watervliet Elementary School. All of which will continue as usual.</p>
<p>All school-related athletic practices will continue as scheduled unless further guidance is provided to our schools from Section 2 or the NYSPHSAA directs otherwise.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor this evolving public health crisis closely and will update our website and share information through our One Call Now system that may impact our schools.</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued support of our district.</p>
<h2>
<a id="Update_March10"></a>Update: Tuesday, March 10, 2020</h2>
<p>The following letter was mailed to all district families on Tuesday, March 10:</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians:</p>
<p>With the recent news of confirmed cases of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, in the Capital Region, I want to let parents, students and staff know that our district continues to monitor information from local, state and federal officials. At this time, there are no confirmed cases in our local school community, and we have received no notifications of any individuals in our community who are currently under quarantine.</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 7, Governor Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York, which gives the state certain purchasing and hiring abilities during this time. This declaration does not impact any school or district activities at this time. Experts have not recommended that the district cancel or reschedule classes or other school events.</p>
<p>State officials continue to emphasize that the general risk to the public is low and that while we all need to be vigilant and cautious, it is also important to stay calm and not contribute to any undue panic.</p>
<p>Regarding travel and quarantine measures, please know that the New York State Department of Health has made quarantine a mandatory measure for individuals returning to the United States from a known high-risk exposure area. Based on this, any student, student family member or employee who has traveled to a known high-risk exposure area should notify the school principal prior to coming to school, as well as contact the Albany County Department of Health at 518-447-4580.</p>
<p>If the district becomes aware that one of our students or staff members is diagnosed with COVID-19, we will notify staff and parents/guardians via email through our One Call Now notification system. Please be sure that your child’s school has your most current contact information, including email address and phone numbers. We will also post information on the district’s website.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo recently announced a new policy for school districts in New York that states if a student tests positive for the coronavirus in a school, that building will be closed for a 24-hour period for an assessment of the situation. The New York State Health Department will make a determination about whether the school should close for longer.</p>
<p>For now, the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and your children continues to be following standard preventive practices for influenza. There are a number of steps that students, staff and community members can take to minimize the spread of all respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, according to the New York State Department of Health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Heavily soiled hands should be washed.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that exposure to COVID-19 can occur from any person-to-person contact and is not limited to a particular race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>More information about COVID-19 is available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>The state Department of Health also has information available on its website, and has a coronavirus hotline. Visit <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/</a>, or call the hotline at 1-888-364-3065 with questions or concerns about travel and symptoms.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are preparing to meet the needs of our students and staff in the event the virus affects our community. Our maintenance staff is taking extra care to clean and disinfect classrooms and common areas in our schools, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning desktops and tables with disinfectant in every classroom nightly.</li>
<li>Cleaning and disinfecting high-contact areas, including water fountains, doorknobs, lockers and bathroom fixtures daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, building principals have instructed our maintenance staff to regularly refill soap dispensers in classrooms that have sinks and in school bathrooms.</p>
<p>We also encourage our teachers and staff to increase the frequency of their classroom hand washing practices and custodians will make available cleaning materials and disinfectants as needed upon staff request. Finally, our school buses will be disinfected on a daily basis.</p>
<p>As of now, we have no plans to cancel or postpone the high school musical this coming weekend or other school events. We will update staff, students, parents/guardians if it becomes necessary to cancel events, including school field trips.</p>
<p>We appreciate your support of our district and we will share more information as it becomes available through our One Call Now system’s e-mail feature, as well as post updates to our website, as necessary. Again, we encourage parents/guardian to please contact your child’s school if you need your contact information updated in our One Call Now system, or if you previously opted out of receiving emails or phone calls and want to opt-in.</p>
<p>Please know that, as always, the health and safety of our students and staff is our highest priority, and we will remain vigilant in our efforts to help prevent the spread of this illness.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Lori Caplan<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>
<h2>
<a id="Update_Feb27"></a>Update: Thursday, February 27, 2020</h2>
<p>Information about the coronavirus</p>
<p>In light of the ongoing media coverage, we are aware of concerns in and around our community about the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the spread of this relatively new virus, which can cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>Based on recent reports, COVID-19 is not actively circulating in New York state, and there are no confirmed cases of the disease in the state at this time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we want to share with you prevention information from the New York State Department of Health on how to minimize the spread of all respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. With any illness, it is important for each individual to take precautions, and we encourage you to take time to review the following steps that students, staff and community members can take to minimize the spread of all respiratory illness, including COVID-19, as recommended by the state Department of Health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. (Heavily soiled hands should be washed.)</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or a family member begin to show symptoms of a respiratory illness, whether or not you suspect it may be COVID-19, we would encourage you to contact your healthcare provider as a precaution.</p>
<p>Our local health department will contact schools if a suspected or known COVID-19 case emerges. Be assured that the health and safety of our staff, students and families is a top priority, and as such, we will continue to monitor this evolving situation and follow guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), Albany County Department of Health and the New York State Education Department with regard to COVID-19.</p>
