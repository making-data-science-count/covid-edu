<p>As a district, following Governor Whitmer’s declared Executive Order closing schools for the remainder of the school year, we have been focusing our efforts to helping children continue to learn and grow, academically, socially, mentally, and emotionally providing enrichment resources during these unprecedented times, which we know are not ideal for learning.</p>

<p>Our teachers and administrators have been embracing new learning, new technology, and new systems and processes to create weekly learning activities for our students with the goal of making sure our children do not academically slide during this time away from school, while taking care of their social and emotional well-being.  Our district is grateful to our entire district team including technology, food service, bus drivers, custodian and maintenance teams, administrative assistants, paraprofessionals, teachers, administrators, Student Support Team, Special Education and Central Office teams, who have helped in new and different ways to develop and launch this plan in a matter of days.  </p>

<p>Since last week, we have been in the process of deploying hundreds of Chromebooks to students.  If your student(s) needs a device, has not received one, and <strong>you have not already completed the Chromebook Request Form</strong>, please do so, only completing once per family. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfValLam9aN1aUE5TxrKjhR6O2Dr6Pi9ylChcdKPkEeg8ylrg/viewform" target="_blank">Chromebook Request Form</a> is open and available until Sunday, April 19 at 8:00 pm to allow for deploying of devices during the week of April 20.</p>

<p>Our Continuity of Learning Plan was submitted and approved this week by Kent Intermediate School District and can be found on our website at the link below.  I encourage you to review the information in advance of teacher’s sending access codes, or providing instructional packets starting next week. You should hear from your child’s teacher(s) with access to a Google Classroom by Monday, April 20 with new content available by Wednesday, April 22 at 11:59 pm as we embark on the final five weeks of the school year.</p>

<p>Please find information on the district’s <a href="https://www.calschools.org/community/continuity-of-learning-plan-clp/" target="_blank">Continuity of Learning Plan</a>, including expectations for each grade level throughout the district.</p>

<p>We understand that this is also not ideal for families who may have multiple parents working from home, have shared or no Internet, be homeschooling multiple children of various ages, and numerous other challenges. Thank you, in advance, for your efforts.  Our team will be flexible, responsive, and work with you and your children to cross the finish line of the 2019-20 school year together!</p>

<p>We look forward to partnering with you and appreciate all you are doing to help in this endeavor.  Stay strong, stay healthy!</p>

        <h2>April 2, 2020<br>
 </h2>

<h4>Dear Caledonia Community Schools Families:</h4>

<p>I hope all of you are staying safe and healthy during this difficult time. At Caledonia Community Schools, we have tried to remain a critical resource for our community during this challenging time, providing nutritious meals each and every week and continuing our students’ education through online learning. I want to thank you for continuing to support our staff, students and families.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I also wanted to express how much we miss our amazing families and students. As difficult as this situation has become, I truly believe we will emerge from this even stronger and more united than ever.  </p>

<p>By now, you probably have heard of Governor Whitmer’s executive order which would close school buildings for the remainder of the year to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I wanted to let you know what we are doing to respond to this development and continue our students’ education. </p>

<h4>Shift to Distance/Online Learning  </h4>

<p>While all of us had hoped our students might return in April, we’ve been busy planning and making preparations for a longer school closure. While the world around us has changed dramatically, our commitment to providing a quality education to every student in Caledonia Community Schools has not wavered. </p>

<p>To that end, we are working with the Caledonia Education Association (CEA) to develop a plan to provide long-term distance/online learning opportunities to continue the instruction of our students. We plan to roll this out after the traditional Spring Break and after state leaders provide more clarity and guidance to local districts. We will keep you updated and informed as we learn more. </p>

<p>We recognize not all families have access to computers or the Internet. We are exploring options to support those families as well as those with specialized and unique learning needs. Please look for an email from your child’s school for a survey to help us quickly determine technology and internet access availability for all children within our school district. It is essential that you respond as soon as possible so we can develop plans for accurate and efficient deployment of devices for those who need them. </p>

<h4>Seniors - Class of 2020</h4>

<p>Please know as we monitor our current situation, we are also working to come up with creative solutions to honor the accomplishments of our seniors. At this moment, it is not clear if our graduation ceremony will be moved, but we are working to provide an answer as soon as possible for our seniors who are on course to graduate this spring. If we are unable to hold graduation due to COVID-19, we will reach out to our students for their assistance in coming up with a viable solution to honor their dedication and accomplishments at Caledonia Community Schools.</p>

<h4>State Assessments</h4>

<p>We are not planning for any state assessments to occur this spring. The Michigan Department of Education received a Federal Waiver for State Assessments. We still need the state legislature to approve waiving those components of state law as it pertains to accountability, third grade reading, etc. We will keep you posted on this.</p>

<h4>AP Testing and Online Courses</h4>

<p>AP Testing is still scheduled: With school closures affecting students across the country, College Board is providing live and on-demand AP courses for free, as well as developing a new at-home testing option.</p>

<h4>School Playgrounds</h4>

<p>Due to last week’s recommendation from the Kent County Health Department, we are reminding everyone that our school facilities and grounds remain closed and we ask that everyone abide by any and all signage restricting access. </p>

<h4>Breakfast &amp; Lunch Support</h4>

<p>Support for families who need food during this time will continue to be provided, including during spring break. We ask that you continue to monitor our district website for any possible changes to our food service program.</p>

<h4>Bond &amp; Millage</h4>

<p>There will be two important proposals on the upcoming May 5, 2020 ballot, an operating millage renewal and a school bond. These two proposals were approved by our board and placed on the ballot before we knew the full impact the coronavirus pandemic would have on our schools, our families and our community. While all of us are dealing with the present, it’s also important to plan for the future. We believe these proposals are critical for the education, health and success of our students and community moving forward. Look for more information in the days ahead.</p>

<p>We are deeply grateful to our staff for all the support they have been providing our students and community during this time of uncertainty. In the days ahead, please follow the state and Kent County Health Department recommendations to Stay Home, Stay Safe and do your part to help stop the spread of this deadly virus. </p>

<p>Dr. Dedrick Martin, Superintendent<br>
Caledonia Community Schools</p>

We are aware of these developments but also realize that no official statement to close for the year has been provided by the Governor or the Michigan Department of Education at this moment. We will continue to monitor this situation and have already begun to develop contingency plans for either scenario, a complete closure of schools or just an extension of the Social Distancing mandate. Either way, look for a more extensive communication from CCS once we have received definitive information and hopefully some guidance regarding the legal requirements of either decision. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

        <h2>Kent County Health Department Message</h2>

<p>March 26, 2020 - As the number of people who test positive for COVID-19 (Coronavirus) begins to climb in Kent County, inevitably we will have students, staff, and family members who will be among those infected by COVID-19.  Our school is in frequent communication with the Kent County Health Department during this difficult time. </p>

<p>The Health Department is responsible for monitoring the incidence of COVID-19 in our community.  Those who test positive are contacted by the Health Department and those people who meet the CDC definition of a close contact are also notified. </p>

<p>The Health Department staff orients cases and their close contacts about the need for isolation or quarantine.  While only a portion of our community will require quarantine,  all of us should be monitoring for symptoms,  maintaining a safe distance from other people whenever possible,  staying home unless it is essential to go out, and washing hands and surfaces frequently.  These steps are good for everyone, whether you have had exposure or not. </p>

<p>As a school, we will not be informing our school families every time one of our students tests positive unless there is a specific reason to do so. We want to respect the confidentiality of each family.  The Health Department is very diligent in their contact investigation and surveillance.  Since school has not been in session for thirteen days, the Kent County Health Department has informed us that the likelihood that your child was exposed to COVID-19 in the school setting is extremely low.   </p>

<p>If you have specific questions or concerns, please reach out to the Health Department at 632-7228.</p>

<p>We continue to receive new guidance from the CDC, state and county officials. Within the last few hours they have recommended that we continue to practice social distancing. As many of you come into the buildings to pick up student items today, March 16th from 1-3 p.m. we are urging you to:</p>

<p>1.) Please come prepared with knowledge of the items you will be retrieving today limiting those to things of necessity such as medication, glasses etc.;</p>

<p>2.) Keep an appropriate distance from others who are present;</p>

<p>3.) Refrain from hand shakes, first bumps, etc.;</p>

<p>4.) Wash hands for 20 seconds or more after touching commonly used hard surfaces;</p>

<p>5.) Refer to the district website Coronavirus link for additional updates during this mandated school closure.</p>

<p>We would like our families and students healthy for our eventual return to school. </p>

<p>Stay healthy! Go Scots!</p>

        <h4>Dear CCS Families,</h4>

<p>As you are aware we are in uncharted waters at this time with the mandated closing of schools and the recent news that the President has declared a national emergency. In conjunction with Governor Whitmer’s shut-down order, Kent County schools have made the decision to remain closed through April 12.  Here are some essentials that we want to make parents aware of:</p>

<h4>Parent/Student Access to Buildings:</h4>

<p>Parents and students will be provided only one opportunity to pick up necessary and essential items such as medications, glasses, etc. This opportunity will be on Monday, March 16th from 1-3 p.m. We need to limit all unnecessary access to our buildings so that our staff can have ample opportunity to provide deep cleaning across our district. If you are unable to make this timeframe and you have an absolute essential need for medications/glasses, please email the principal and we will make individualized arrangements as necessary.</p>

<h4>Food Service:</h4>

<p>Our food service staff will be providing carry-out breakfast and lunch free of charge to anyone 18 or younger, Monday to Thursday from 9:00 - 2:30 until further notice from Duncan Lake Middle School Cafeteria. (This is subject to change and any changes will be communicated on our website.)  Adult meals will be available for purchase (cash only) during this same time frame. Parents and students can obtain up to five days worth of meals at a time.</p>

<h4>Academic Enrichment Opportunities:</h4>

<p>Teachers are strongly encouraged to electronically provide weekly enrichment suggestions and “resources” that parents and students may utilize to keep previously learned skills sharp. These items will be non-graded and will not cover new content that students are expected to master.  Special Education Teachers and Itinerant staff are also encouraged to provide their caseload students with enrichment resources and/or activities that will reinforce skills and maintain progress on goals. Expect these academic enrichment resources to be provided by the middle of next week.  </p>

<h4>Special Education:</h4>

<p>Case managers will be contacting parents of students whose Individualized Education Program (IEP) team is scheduled to meet during the closure period to consider utilizing a remote format such as phone or video conferencing.  </p>

<h4>State Assessments:</h4>

<p>At this time we have no new information regarding the State Assessment window.  We will share any changes that might be communicated from the Department of Education.</p>

<h4>Field Trips/ High School Interim:</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, we will need to cancel all field trips, including high school interim, for the remainder of the year.  These trips involve many logistics including deposits that make it impossible to move forward during these uncertain times. More information will follow from the individual buildings regarding field trip cancelations. We ask for your patience as we gather more information to share out. </p>

<h4>Athletics:</h4>

<p>The Michigan High School Athletic Association has directed all member schools to suspend activities in all sports for all seasons.  Caledonia Community Community schools is suspending practices, scrimmages and competitions/games, as well as strength training, conditioning and any other organized sessions and activities in all MHSAA in-season and out-of-season sports through April 12, 2020.

<h4>Social-Emotional Supports:</h4>

<p>The district Student Support Team has been encouraged to identify social-emotional resources for families that can be posted on our district website and shared, as needed, with individual students and/or families.</p>

<h4>School Cleaning and Disinfection:</h4>

<p>The district's custodial staff will be working diligently during the closure to clean and disinfect district facilities. It is essential that we strictly  adhere to our building closures for staff and students so that they can effectively clean our buildings before our students return. </p>

<h4>Internal Transfer Process/Student Enrollment:</h4>

<p>Please refer to the district’s website for both the internal transfer process for specific building request changes for your child as well as new student enrollment. Registration for the internal transfer process begins March 16, 2020, and ends on April 30, 2020. (This is an online process).</p>

<p><strong>Please realize that any and all information is subject to change as we continue to receive guidance from state and federal agencies. These changes will be updated to links found on our website as necessary.</strong></p>

<p>In closing, we realize that during extraordinary times, we must be willing to take extraordinary measures. We are asking all of our families to work with us through this difficult time period for our district, state and nation. As such, we are asking all district stakeholders to practice patience and understanding as we work to provide you with relevant and factual information in the rapidly changing environment. Remember that we all recognize that the word “community” is in our name and as a school community, we will work to support each other, our students and our families over the next few weeks.</p>

Dr. Dedrick Martin<br>

        <h4>Dear Parents &amp; Staff,</h4>

<p>Over the past 16 hours information from various state, local and national agencies regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been rapidly evolving. This has been especially true in the State of Michigan now that 2 individuals on the east side of the state have tested positive for COVID-19. This was followed by Governor Whitmer declaring a state of emergency on Tuesday evening with the hopes of slowing the spread of the virus. </p>

<p>As shared in my previous communication, CCS will continue to monitor and take its direction concerning the Coronavirus from three primary sources: A.) the <a href="https://www.accesskent.com/Health/coronavirus.htm" target="_blank">Kent County Health Department</a>, B.) the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/" target="_blank">Michigan Department of Health and Human Services</a> (MDHHS), and C.) the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mde/" target="_blank">Michigan Department of Education</a>. These entities receive guidance from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/guidance-for-schools.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fguidance-for-schools.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC). </p>

<h4>About the Virus:</h4>

<p>COVID-19 symptoms range from mild cold-like illness to severe pneumonia. You should look out for symptoms such as fever, coughs and difficulty breathing. Similar to the flu, the people who are most likely to experience severe complications from COVID-19 are older individuals (60+) and those with medical conditions such as heart and lung disease or diabetes.</p>

<p>While there are NO confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Kent county as of today, experts predict that the virus will spread and encourage taking precautions.     </p>

<h4>Preventative Measures:</h4>

<p>Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 infection. As with any respiratory virus, students and school personnel can protect themselves and others by taking every day common-sense actions: </p>

<p>1. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.<br>
2. Use a paper towel, if available,  to turn off the water after hand washing.<br>
3. Use hand sanitizer if the soap is not available.<br>
4. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. <br>
5. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.<br>
6.Get a flu shot if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>We encourage all staff, students and parents who are experiencing any cold or flu-like systems to stay at home when sick and seek medical attention if necessary.</p>

<p>Cover your cough or sneeze into your elbow or with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. </p>

<p>Please make your building administrator aware if you or someone in your family is diagnosed or in direct contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 so that we can work closely with the health department for additional preventative measures to minimize the spread of the virus. </p>

<h4>Keeping Our Students and Staff Healthy:</h4>

<p>Our campus custodial staff will continue to use disinfectant products and tools daily to help mitigate the spread of communicable illnesses on hard surfaces. Our cleaning regimen and products are highly effective against Coronavirus and influenza, however, since the virus can spread so easily we encourage everyone to follow the preventative measures identified above. Additionally, in order to allow our custodial staff the greatest opportunity to efficiently and effectively clean our school buildings and being consistent with recommendations from the county health department, we will implement a moratorium on all facility rentals until further notice. Please contact the operations office for specific questions at 616-891-0225 or <a href="mailto:osbornj@calschools.org">osbornj@calschools.org</a>. </p>

<h4>Athletics:</h4>

<p>All high school and middle school athletic events will follow guidance by MHSAA as the governing body for athletics throughout the state. Please refer to the link for ongoing updates regarding athletics in general and specific athletic events.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mhsaa.com/coronavirus" target="_blank">MHSAA COVID-19 Updates</a></p>

<h4>Extra-Curricular, Co-Curricular and School Sponsored Public Events:</h4>

<p>Consistent with guidance provided from the Kent County Health Department, our district is placing a moratorium on all student and school-related events and activities including concerts, field trips, co-curricular competitions, etc. until further notice. </p>

<p>We encourage parents to visit the district website for the most up to date information. Todays’ elementary conferences will be conducted via a phone call initiated by your teacher during the scheduled conference appointment. A decision regarding secondary conferences will be communicated at a later date. </p>

<h4>Emotional and Behavioral Support: </h4>

<p>Clearly the concerns around COVID-19 are increasing and fluid. It’s important that adults respond in a measured and rational fashion so that we don’t cause unnecessary anxiety and fear for our children. Please be open to hearing concerns from your child and reassure them that by consistently using precautions we can have an impact on reducing the spread of this virus. In no circumstance is it appropriate for staff, students, or visitors to the school to make derisive comments or to “joke” about those who are impacted by any virus. Again, we are monitoring all of our resources very closely. Should the situation change in our district or area, we will be consulting with the Kent County Health Department on appropriate next steps.  We will also update our website with additional information as it evolves. Expect to receive another letter from the Kent County Health Department later today regarding a unified approach from all educational organizations within our county.  </p>

<p>Thanks so much for joining us in helping to keep Caledonia Community Schools healthy in all ways. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Dr. Dedrick Martin<br>
Superintendent<br>
Caledonia Community Schools</p>

        <h4>Dear Parents &amp; Staff,</h4>

<p>Over the past several days we have been tracking and obtaining information from various state and local agencies regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Like many others, you are probably following the news regarding COVID-19. We want to take this opportunity to update you on the measures that our school district is taking to ensure the safety and health of our students and staff.</p>

<h4>About the virus itself...</h4>

<p>Caledonia Community Schools will take its direction concerning the Coronavirus from three primary sources: A.) the <a href="https://www.accesskent.com/Health/coronavirus.htm" target="_blank">Kent County Health Department</a>, B.) the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/" target="_blank">Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS),</a> and C.) the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mde/" target="_blank">Michigan Department of Education</a>. These entities receive guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is an evolving situation that is changing almost on a daily basis. As a result, we are continuously monitoring the information that is provided. Please visit our website at calschools.org for links to agencies with up-to-the-moment updates about Coronavirus.</p>

<p>Currently, the health risk to the general public remains low. At this time Michigan does not have any confirmed cases of COVID 19. Again, we are monitoring CDC, Michigan and Kent County recommendations for dealing with the potential of an outbreak in the county.</p>

<h4>Symptoms…</h4>

<p>What we currently know is that COVID-19 causes mild-to-moderate illness and symptoms like the flu, including fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 infection. As with any respiratory virus, students and school personnel can protect themselves and others by taking every day common sense actions:</p>

<p>• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.<br>
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.<br>
• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.<br>
• Stay home when you are sick.<br>
• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.<br>
• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</p>

<h4>Keeping our students and staff healthy...</h4>

<p>Our campus custodial staff will continue to use disinfectant products to help offset the spread of communicable illnesses. Our cleaning regimen and products are highly effective against Coronavirus and influenza. While the Coronavirus is getting a lot of media attention, it is still flu season. We encourage you to get a flu shot if you have not already.</p>

<h4>Emotional and behavioral support...</h4>

<p>Children may hear alarming stories about the Coronavirus, causing them to feel anxious or fearful. Please be open to hearing concerns from your child and reassure them. In no circumstance is it appropriate for staff, students, or visitors to the school to make derisive comments or to “joke” about those who are impacted by any virus. Again, we are monitoring all of our resources very closely. Should the situation change in our area, we will be in touch immediately.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Executive Order sets guidelines for remote learning, ensures teachers, school employees will be paid for remainder of school year</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>LANSING, Mich.</strong> — Governor Gretchen Whitmer today signed Executive Order 2020-35, which orders all K-12 school buildings to close for the remainder of the school year — unless restrictions are lifted — and ensures continuing of learning by setting guidelines for remote learning. District facilities may be used by public school employees and contractors for the purposes of facilitating learning at a distance while also practicing social distancing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“My number one priority right now is protecting Michigan families from the spread of COVID-19. For the sake of our students, their families, and the more than 100,000 teachers and staff in our state, I have made the difficult decision to close our school facilities for the remainder of the school year,” <strong>Governor Whitmer</strong> said. “As a parent, I understand the challenge closing schools creates for parents and guardians across the state, which is why we are setting guidelines for schools to continue remote learning and ensuring parents have resources to continue their children’s education from the safety of their homes. There is no video chat or homework packet that can replace the value of a highly trained, experienced teacher working with students in a classroom, but we must continue to provide equitable educational opportunities for students during this public health crisis.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators and the Michigan Council of Charter School Authorizers are currently developing a Continuity of Learning Plan template application for schools to utilize in order to create their localized plan. The application will be made available by April 3. District plans will need to detail how districts will provide opportunities for students to learn remotely and how schools will manage and monitor their progress. It will also provide information on how parents and guardians can learn more about the local plan. Each district must have its plan approved by their regional intermediate school district before being implemented. Public school academies must have their plans approved by their authorizer. Districts can also partner with one another to create joint plans.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Every district’s plan will be different and will reflect what’s best and feasible for their community. A plan can include learning by any number of modes of instruction delivery, including a hybrid approach. However they are designed, districts must ensure their plans are appropriate, equitable and accessible for students and families.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the plan relies on some online instruction, the district should ensure every student who needs it has access to an appropriate device with an ability to connect to the internet. Students and families will not be penalized if they are unable to participate in their alternate learning plan.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Schools should continue to provide mental health care services for students, to the extent possible, and should be ready and willing to help efforts to establish disaster relief childcare centers. School districts will also continue to provide meals for families who need them during the COVID-19 crisis. If any schools have unused personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies or other materials, they are allowed and encouraged to donate them to organizations that could put them to use.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>School districts will have the flexibility to adopt a balanced calendar for the 2019-2020 school year and/or to begin the 2020-2021 school year before Labor Day without having to seek additional approval. Teachers and school employees will be paid for the remainder of the school year. Student teachers will still be able to get a temporary certification and current teachers will still be able to get their certifications renewed, even if they can’t meet all the requirements due to COVID-19.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>All Michigan high school seniors will be given the opportunity to graduate this year so that they may make a successful postsecondary transition. Additionally, all standardized tests previously scheduled for the remainder of the school year, including the M-STEP and the SAT, will be canceled. There will be a date in October for rising high school seniors to take the SAT and for other high school students to take the PSAT.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus and CDC.gov/Coronavirus.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>Governor <span>Whitmer</span> Announces Statewide Closure of All K-12 School Buildings</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE </p>

<p>March 12, 2020 </p>

<p>Governor <span>Whitmer</span> Announces Statewide Closure of All K-12 School Buildings </p>

<p>School building closures will last Monday, March 16 through Sunday, April 5 </p>

<p>LANSING, Mich. -- Today, Governor Gretchen <span>Whitmer</span> announced that in order to slow the spread of Novel <span>Coronavirus</span> (<span>COVID-19</span>) in Michigan, she is ordering the closure of all K-12 school buildings, public, private, and boarding, to students starting Monday, March 16 until Sunday, April 5. School buildings are scheduled to reopen on Monday, April 6. </p>

<p>As of tonight, the number of presumptive positive cases of <span>COVID-19</span> in Michigan is 12. </p>

<p>“This is a necessary step to protect our kids, our families, and our overall public health,” said Governor <span>Whitmer</span>. “I am working with partners across state government to ensure educators, parents, and students have the support they need during this time, and to ensure our children who rely on school for meals have access to food. I know this will be a tough time, but we’re doing this to keep the most people we can safe. I urge everyone to make smart choices during this time and to do everything they can to protect themselves and their families.” </p>

<p>“Closing our K-12 school buildings is the responsible choice that will minimize the risk of exposure for children, educators, and families and mitigate the spread of <span>coronavirus</span>,” said Michigan State Superintendent Michael Rice. “The Department of Education will continue to work closely with our partners in state government to help our students and educators in each school district get through this time. This is about protecting the most people in Michigan.” </p>

<p>Governors across the country, including Mike <span>DeWine</span> (R-OH), Andy <span>Beshear</span> (D-KY), and Larry Hogan (R-MD), have taken similar steps to close schools and ensure the protection of children and families in their states. </p>

<p>“Closing our school buildings is the smart thing and the right thing to do for the public’s health,” said Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. <span>Joneigh</span> <span>Khaldun</span>. “These actions will help mitigate the spread of <span>COVID-19</span> in Michigan. I will continue to work with Governor <span>Whitmer</span> and our four <span>COVID-19</span> task forces to ensure we protect our children, our families, and our communities.”  </p>

<p>Patients with confirmed infection have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fever </li>
	<li>Cough </li>
	<li>Shortness of breath </li>
</ul>

<h4>April 3, 2020</h4>

<p>The coronavirus has brought unexpected changes to our 2019-2020 spring sports.  The MHSAA has decided to cancel the 2020 spring sports athletic season. We are sad to see that our seniors will not be able to participate in their last year of high school sports.  The most important thing that we need to continue to do at this point, is stay safe and healthy. The Cal athletic department is looking at ways to highlight our spring sports and our seniors.  Your coaches will reach out to their seniors next week with more information pertaining to how we will do this.  </p>

<p>All athletes will be refunded their spring athletic fee.  Please email: nemecekb@calschools.org the Resource Center for your refund.  The refund process will begin over spring break. </p>

<p>If you have any practice equipment or uniforms, the coaches will reach out to you on how to return those items in late summer. More important information to come in the following week.</p>
