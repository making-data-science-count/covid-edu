<p class="">Dear Parents,</p>
<p class="">I hope that this finds you and your family staying safe and healthy during this spring break. </p>
<p class="">The Closter Police Department has asked me to remind parents that <strong>social distancing is still in effect</strong>. Please do not allow your children to go on playdates or bike riding with children who are not members of your own family. It may seem harmless for friends to hang out together - but it may not be so. This is how the coronavirus can be easily transmitted from one family to another. <strong>Please have your children stay at home with your own family and on your own property!</strong> </p>
<p class="">I encourage you to allow your children to take a break from virtual learning this week. A mental break is definitely needed at this stressful time. However, if you are seeking resources for some academic work this week, there are many <a href="https://wideopenschool.org/" title="" alt="" target="_blank">activities available on WideOpenSchool</a>. In addition, each weekday, NJTV Learning Live will offer four televised programs for grades three to six. Third-grade instruction begins at 9:00 a.m., fourth-grade programming is at 10:00 a.m., fifth-grade is at 11:00 a.m.; and sixth-grade is at noon. Subjects will include English language arts, math, science, social studies, and a "special" such as art, music, or physical education. You can <a href="https://www.njtvonline.org/about/where-to-watch/" title="" alt="" target="_blank">locate your local channel on NJTV's Where to Watch webpage</a>.</p>
<p class="">Please stay safe and healthy!</p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="">Vincent McHale<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p class="">Dear Parents,</p>
<p class="">As we complete week two of virtual learning, I would like to advise you that our administrators and staff are working to include more pre-recorded videos of our Closter teachers providing instruction for students. Teachers in grades two through eight will also plan at least one virtual drop-in session using Zoom so students can ask questions and connect with their teacher and classmates. This is a new way of delivering instruction and we ask for your patience as our teachers and administrators make the transition to providing instruction through a virtual platform. </p>
<p class="">The New Jersey Department of Education provision for instruction through a virtual platform does not require parental consent. However, we have been careful in our planning for the use of streaming video to ensure online safety for everyone - teachers, students, and parents. To that end, <strong>I am asking all parents to please log-into the Genesis Parent Access to indicate that they have read and agree to the following statement</strong>:</p>
<p class="">I understand and agree that the district does not authorize parental participation in online instruction, just as I would not be a participant in my child’s in-school instruction. I shall limit my presence during online instruction to setting up the conferencing equipment for my child at the start of the session and providing my child with assistance to return to the conference if he or she disengages from the instruction. During online instruction, I shall not audio-record or video-record the session and I shall reinforce my child’s obligation to adhere to and comply with all applicable board policies governing the use of technology during remote instruction. </p>
<p class="">Upon logging into Genesis, parents of students who receive special services will be asked for consent and acknowledgment for their child to participate in self-contained special education group sessions online and/or online related services. </p>
<p class="">To log-in to Genesis Parent Access, please <a href="https://parents.genesisedu.com/closter/parents?gohome=true" title="" alt="" target="_blank">visit the log-in page</a>. Your username is the email address you provided to the district. If you do not remember your password, you may click on "forgot my password." If you require any further assistance, Hillside Elementary School parents may <a href="mailto:carmichael@nvnet.org" title="" alt="" target="_top">contact Dr. Carmichael by email</a>; and Tenakill Middle School parents may <a href="mailto:mcelroyk@nvnet.org" title="" alt="" target="_top">contact Mr. McElroy by email</a>.  </p>
<p class="">While students are participating in live virtual drop-in sessions with their teacher and classmates, they must adhere to expectations for appropriate online behavior. Please review the following expectations with your child: </p>
<p class=""></p>
<ol>
<li class="">Students will not record, take screenshots, or share any part of their “virtual” learning environment without express permission granted by a teacher or administrator.</li>
<li class="">Students will use school-provided learning platforms or school-managed online accounts to share educationally-appropriate material. Sharing inappropriate material, images, links, or videos with any student, parent, or Closter Public School employee shall result in disciplinary action. This includes sharing inappropriate material during live Zoom sessions.</li>
<li class="">Students will be dressed in school-appropriate attire when attending a video classroom.</li>
<li class="">Students will electronically communicate with teachers, administrators, and other students in the following subscribed formats:<ol>
<li class="">Student to Teacher - Schoology messages, Schoology/Google Classroom/Seesaw comments and discussion threads, district-issued email.</li>
<li class="">Student to Administrator – Schoology messages, district-issued email</li>
<li class="">Student to Student – responses to Schoology/Google/Seesaw comments and discussion threads</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p class="">Thank you for your continued support in this new world of online learning. As always, if you have any questions, please email your child's teacher or an administrator (<a href="/Our-Administration" title="" alt="" target="_self">contact information can be found on our  Administration page</a>). </p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="">Vincent McHale<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p class="">Dear Parents,</p>
<p class="">I hope that this email finds your family healthy and keeping in good spirits during these challenging times. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback in the survey about virtual learning. The information has been helpful and we are adjusting as we move forward.</p>
<p class="">As of this morning, there has been no word of schools reopening next week. Our teachers will continue to deliver virtual learning for students until notified otherwise by the Governor’s office. When I have information about school re-opening, I will let you know immediately. </p>
<p class="">I had several inquiries from parents about whether anyone in our school district has COVID-19. To my knowledge, there are no students or employees who have been diagnosed. Moving forward, if there are any cases in our community, the Bergen County Health Department will notify anyone deemed to have had contact with a student or employee found to have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. I would urge you to continue keeping children at home and to practice social-distancing of six feet or more when outside your home. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" title="" alt="" target="_blank">Please visit the link to the CDC website</a> which has information about symptoms and what do if you are sick</p>
<p class="">Lastly, the New Jersey Department of Education has announced that the New Jersey Student Learning Assessments (formerly known as PARCC) have been cancelled for this year. This reduces some stress for us all! </p>
<p class="">Thank you for all you are doing to make the virtual learning days take place. I know it is a challenging time for everyone but Closter is a strong, caring community. Together we will get through this.</p>
<p class="">Stay healthy and safe!</p>
<p class="">Regards,</p>
<p class="">Vincent McHale<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p class="">Dear Parents,</p>
<p class="">It is already the fifth day of virtual learning! Thank you for your patience and support as we transitioned so quickly to online learning. In a matter of one week, we have managed to completely change how school operates. You have had a major role in ensuring that your child is logging on and completing assignments. The administrators, teachers, staff, and I thank you for all that you have done to make this work!  </p>
<p class="">I am inviting parents, students in grades three through eight, and staff to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/VirtualLearningSurvey" title="" alt="" target="_blank">complete a brief survey</a> today so I may gather feedback on how the first week of virtual learning went. The administrators will review the survey feedback and if adjustments are needed, we will attempt to have them in place for next week. At this time, I have no information about how long schools will remain closed, as this decision will be made by Governor Murphy. When I have more information, I will certainly communicate it to you. </p>
<p class="">If you have questions or concerns during the virtual learning days, please email your child's teacher, principal, or me at any time. Together we will get through this crisis.  </p>
<p class="">My wish is that all of our Closter families remain healthy and safe. Remember to keep a social distance and wash hands often with soap and water!</p>
<p class="">Regards,</p>
<p class="">Vincent McHale<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>

<div class="">
<p class="">Dear Parents,</p>
<p class="">Beginning on Monday, March 16, 2020, school buildings will be closed but students will be able to participate in our virtual learning days. By providing online instruction, we can count the days toward the 180-day requirement that schools must be in session. I am confident our faculty will provide students with a positive learning experience. Thank you for your support in this new process!</p>
<p class="">Students must register their attendance each weekday morning by 10:00 a.m. To do this, each student, or parent of younger students, should visit the school website and click on the daily attendance check-in link. This will open a form that the student will complete. Teachers will post assignments online each weekday by 9:00 a.m. Students may complete the assignments at any time during the day. They are not required to be online at any specific time. We did this so parents would have flexibility in deciding when would be best to complete the school assignments. Here is where students can find daily assignments:</p>
<p class=""></p>
<ul>
<li class="">For students in pre-k and kindergarten, the teacher will send the assignments to the parent’s email address.</li>
<li class="">For students in grades first and second, <a href="https://app.seesaw.me/#/student/login" title="" alt="" target="_blank" class="">sign-in to Seesaw</a>.</li>
<li class="">For students in grade three, <a href="https://classroom.google.com/" title="" alt="" target="_blank">sign-in to Google Classroom</a>.</li>
<li class="">For students in grades four through eight, <a href="https://closter.schoology.com/login?&amp;school=" title="" alt="" target="_blank">sign-in to Schoology</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="">Yesterday, teachers reviewed the attendance sign-in process with students. Students should be familiar with logging in to the website listed for their grade. However, if your child is unsure of the process, please email your child’s teacher for assistance. Teachers will be available each day for a two-hour block for live assistance. The teachers will communicate with students when the “live assistance” will be each day.  </p>
<p class="">I have added a section to the Closter Public Schools website home page, labeled <a href="/Home#VirtualLearningDay" title="" alt="" target="_self">Virtual Learning Day</a>. There is a simple, one-page document <a href="https://tb2cdn.schoolwebmasters.com/accnt_390190/site_390191/Documents/Virtual-Day-Overview-March-2020.pdf" title="" alt="" target="_blank">describing the virtual learning day process</a>. If you have any questions about the process at any time, please email your child’s teacher.</p>
<p class="">If you have not yet notified the district that your child does not have an internet-connected device (computer, iPad, tablet, laptop, Chromebook, etc.) at home, please <a href="mailto:salvati@nvnet.org" title="" alt="" target="_top">contact Vincent Salvati by email</a>. He will plan with you to borrow a device from the district on Monday, March 16, 2020.</p>
<p class="">If you have any questions or concerns during the virtual learning days, please email your child’s teacher, principal or me. We will not be at school to answer calls, but we will be working daily from home and can respond to email. You can find contact information at the following sites:</p>
<p class=""></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><a href="/Our-Schools" title="" alt="" target="_self">District</a></li>
<li class=""><a href="https://hillside.closterschools.org/Teachers-and-Staff" title="" alt="" target="_blank">Hillside Elementary School</a></li>
<li class=""><a href="https://tenakill.closterschools.org/Teachers-and-Staff" title="" alt="" target="_blank">Tenakill Middle School</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="">Lastly and most importantly, please understand that the purpose of closing the schools is to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. You are asked to keep your children home and not to arrange playdates. Students should not be permitted to leave home unaccompanied by a parent. If we make the commitment as a community to limit our social interactions to only those that are essential, we will reduce the possibility of the virus spreading in Closter.   </p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="">Vincent McHale<br>Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p class="">Dear Parents, </p>
<p class="">On March 12, 2020, Bergen County Executive James Tedesco issued a mandatory closure of all Bergen County Public School Districts as of 3:00 p.m. on Friday, March 13. The closure will be for a minimum of two weeks. During this time, we will provide virtual learning for students through the use of technology. </p>
<p class="">Information about how students will access online learning is posted on the Virtual Learning Day link above. During virtual learning days, students will be provided with approximately two hours of schoolwork, but they can complete the assignments at any time of the day. Students will have to register their attendance each day by 10:00 a.m. using a Google form that we will post on the school website. Students in grades K-2 may need parent assistance to sign-in their attendance. Please note that during the two-week closure, students should remain at home and only leave home with parental supervision. The idea is to limit exposure to coronavirus, and the best way to do this is through social distancing. </p>
<p class="">Thank you for your continued support of the Closter Public School during this very challenging time! Together we will get through this! </p>

<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">This week our district team has been keeping up-to-date on information regarding the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. On Tuesday evening, I dialed into Governor Murphy’s conference call for school leaders. During the call, Governor Murphy said, “This is not a time to panic, but it sure is a time to prepare.” I want you to know that here in Closter Public Schools, we have been preparing and planning.</p>
<p class="">As I advised in <a href="https://tb2cdn.schoolwebmasters.com/accnt_390190/site_390191/Documents/Coronavirus-Letter-2-26-2020.pdf" title="" alt="" target="_blank">my previous correspondence</a>, we are practicing preventative measures to reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza:</p>
<p class=""></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Our custodians continue to clean, sanitize, and disinfect surfaces throughout the day.</li>
<li class="">We have posted signs in the schools about the steps to prevent the spread of germs. We are educating students about how to keep healthy. I have attached a parent's guide for discussing coronavirus with children for your reference. </li>
<li class="">We are encouraging students and staff to stay home if they are sick. </li>
<li class="">We will be sending students and staff who become sick at school or arrive at school sick home as soon as possible. We are mindful of the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that schools are not expected to screen students or staff to identify cases of COVID-19.</li>
<li class="">I have been in communication with our Closter Health Official, Jin Bae, and will continue to communicate with her as questions arise. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="">While there are currently only two “presumptive positive” cases of COVID-19 in New Jersey, we are preparing a plan for the unlikely event of an extended school closing due to an epidemic. In this plan, we want to ensure that we can communicate with students, families, and staff while running core district operations. As part of this plan, we would attempt to continue the learning process for our students through the use of online technology. </p>
<p class="">To plan accordingly, I need to determine how many students do not have home access to a computer with Internet connectivity. If your child would not have access to a home computer with Internet access for least a part of the day, I ask that you complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScg4m40eebm4U3Y1UKgwAy5tU2dX_fTss6hk0gpq5aJvfOHlw/viewform" title="" alt="" target="_blank">this brief survey</a> so that we can prepare hard-copy materials or device loaners if you have home Internet connectivity. </p>
<p class="">Again, extended school closure is not likely and we will determine in consultation with the Department of Health and the New Jersey Department of Education. Being proactive is the best practice. I encourage working parents to begin thinking about childcare in case there is a sudden outbreak of this virus that would result in school closing. </p>
<p class="">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their guidance on travel to indicate that anyone traveling from a country with a Level-3 outbreak of COVID-19 now must stay at home for 14 days and be symptom-free before returning to school or work. Closter Public Schools will be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" title="" alt="" target="_blank">following this protocol</a>.</p>
<p class="">Lastly, the guidance from the New Jersey Department of Health at this time indicates there is no need to cancel school or social events. I remind everyone that part of good respiratory hygiene is staying home from school and events when you are ill. </p>
