<p><strong>Update: April 20, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Earlier today Governor DeWine announced that all Ohio school buildings will be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year.  School districts are required to continue distance instruction for the days remaining on the adopted school calendar.  The Athens City School District will continue distance education through Thursday, May 28th.  </p>

<p><br>
We are aware that many students have personal items in their desks or lockers at school.  We will come up with a plan for parents to be able to pick up those items in the near future.</p>

<p><br>
While the Ohio High School Athletic Association has yet to make an official announcement, they have previously indicated that spring sports seasons would be cancelled if the school closure order was extended.  We should expect an official communication from the OHSAA in the next day or two.</p>

<p><br>
As a result of the Governor's Order, any and all school trips, events, activities, or ceremonies that were previously scheduled between now and the end of the school year are cancelled.  Unfortunately, this order will include the cancellation of the Athens High School Prom, the Senior Trip and all in person Commencement activities in May.  The Athens High School Administrative Team is working on a plan for a virtual commencement ceremony, as well as setting up alternative dates later in the summer for an in-person commencement should it become possible to host such an event.</p>

<p><strong>Update: April 17, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Earlier today our Director of Technology, Steve Gunderson, shared with me a story about a 3rd Grade student who worked with him on the phone for nearly an hour to replace a SIM card in a hotspot, get her Chromebook started up, and connect to the internet.  I later learned from this student's teacher that her father and grandmother had taken her to the library parking lot to use the drive-up internet every day since online instruction started just to make sure she was able to participate!  I've heard other stories like this about the great lengths families are going through to make sure students are able to "attend" their classes.  Thank you to our parents, grandparents and other caregivers for all of the support you have provided over the past few weeks.  We understand this is difficult work and we appreciate all you do to support your children.  This story also brings to mind the handful of technology specialists who work behind the scenes to keep our technology services going.  In addition to Steve Gunderson, I'd like to thank Rob Purcell, Simon Dikki, and Tammy Hawk for all of their work to make sure our students can have access to their teachers.  Your efforts have not gone unnoticed.  Thank you!<br>
 </p>

<p>Please be reminded that if you do need technology support, in addition to calling our helpline at 740-797-4544 x1229 you can also call the Ohio University Technology HelpDesk at 740-593-1223, option #2.  I've also learned that the Athens County Public Library is scheduling free remote technology training appointments to help families with training on basic computer skills.  The link to the Athens News story about that service is here: <a href="https://www.athensnews.com/calendar/miscellaneous/remote-technology-training-appointments/event_fd3643e4-7a8d-11ea-a391-8ba7fabd9e7d.html" target="_blank">https://www.athensnews.com/calendar/miscellaneous/remote-technology-training-appointments/event_fd3643e4-7a8d-11ea-a391-8ba7fabd9e7d.html</a></p>

<p><br>
As I close out my message this evening, I'd like to share with you a short poem by Walter D. Wintle:</p>

<p><br>
“If you think you are beaten, you are<br>
If you think you dare not, you don't,<br>
If you like to win, but you think you can't<br>
It is almost certain you won't.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you think you'll lose, you're lost<br>
For out of the world we find,<br>
Success begins with a fellow's will<br>
It's all in the state of mind.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you think you are outclassed, you are<br>
You've got to think high to rise,<br>
You've got to be sure of yourself before<br>
You can ever win a prize.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Life's battles don't always go<br>
To the stronger or faster man (person),<br>
But sooner or later the man(person) who wins<br>
Is the man(one)  WHO THINKS HE(they) CAN!”<br>
― Walter D. Wintle</p>

<p><br>
We've got this.<br>
We can do this.<br>
We are the Athens Bulldogs, and<br>
We are in this together!</p>

<p><br>
Please accept my wishes of good health to all of our families.  Thank you for your continued support.  Have a great weekend!</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: April 13, 2020 (2/2)</strong></p>

<p>On Friday the District received our hotspots and immediately began logging serial numbers and getting devices set up.  This is a bit more detailed of a process for us, as we are required to provide filtered internet, which necessitated our working with T-Mobile to run each of the devices through a specific filtering server address.  T-Mobile completed their setup today and our team began making final changes on each device this afternoon.  This will take some time, however we should be situated to begin contacting families who are on our hotspot request list as early as tomorrow afternoon and should be able to get devices to every family who has requested one by the end of the week.<br><br>
Despite the challenges with connectivity, we are seeing a very high participation rate by students.  I appreciate the efforts families are making to get to wireless access areas throughout the community to assure your students are online.  Thank you!<br><br>
I would like to highlight two specific messages that went out on Friday and Monday:  <br><br>
The first is regarding a partnership with Ohio University to provide tech support to our students and families.  Families are now able to call the Ohio University Technology Service Desk at 740-593-1223, option 2.  The service desk hours are M-F 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday &amp; Sunday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  A detailed message was sent out on Friday about this partnership.  We are very grateful to Ohio University for providing this support.<br><br>
Earlier today, any family with students attending the Athens City School District on Inter-District Open-Enrollment and those families with elementary age students participating in Intra-District Open Enrollment for whom we have email addresses on file should have received a message with directions for how to complete and turn in Open Enrollment Forms online through Final Forms.  Please be reminded that each student is required to apply each year.  The application window will be open for two weeks.  It is my intention to accept every student who is currently attending one of our schools on Open-Enrollment for the coming year.  If you did not receive an email or if you are unable to access the online forms, we will work with you to make sure your child can continue to attend the Athens City School District.<br><br>
Please be reminded that meal deliveries will be on Tuesday and Thursday for the next few weeks. On Tuesday, each student will receive school meals for Tuesday and Wednesday and on Thursday the delivery will have school meals for Thursday, Friday, and Monday.<br><br>
As I close tonight's message, I'd like to take a moment to thank our teachers and building administrators.  They have worked many hours over the past few weeks preparing for and learning about online instruction and taking the time to connect with students and families.  For most of us, this is a new adventure, and one filled with much anxiety.  Please join me in thanking our classroom teachers and building administrators for all that they have done so far and will continue to do to keep our students connected to school.  The relationships our teachers have with students and families are vital to our children's success<br><br>
Please accept my sincere wishes for the health and wellness of each of our students and their families.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: April 10, 2020</strong></p>

<p>To help support the Athens City School District (ACSD) successfully transition to online instruction, Ohio University's Office of Information Technology (OIT) will provide tech support for ACSD students and instructors, helping the district's handful of IT employees keep up with what is likely to be a flood of support calls in the coming weeks.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Starting April 13, families within the <a href="https://www.athenscsd.org/">Athens City School District</a> may call 740-593-1223 (option #2) for help with internet setup, online learning apps, and device troubleshooting. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“We’re fortunate to have this partnership with OHIO’s OIT to help support our students and faculty in this difficult time,” Tom Gibbs, Superintendent of Athens City School District, said. “We understand the challenges for some in our community when it comes to technology and believe this support will truly help our students in remote learning.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With a reported 16% of ACSD students without access to home internet, the district will begin distributing hotspots in the very near future. OHIO is also offering the community <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/oit/services/internet/wi-fi/help/athens-coverage" target="_blank">free guest wi-fi coverage in many Athens campus parking lots(opens in a new window)</a>; however, access is just the first step. Support becomes a big deal when technology isn't just a part of the classroom but is the classroom.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Since schools have transitioned to online instruction, it is more important than ever that students have the necessities like internet to continue their education,” OHIO Chief Information Officer Chris Ament said. “By providing IT support to our local school district, we are helping ensure accessibility to area students while also providing remote work for our own OHIO students.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Calls will be fielded by OIT student employees who worked at the IT Service Desk in the Tech Depot before social distancing restrictions closed that location.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"It's a win-win situation," Mary Jeffreys, OIT Service Desk manager, said. "We can handle the added call volume, and it gives our students a chance to keep working remotely while making a meaningful contribution to the local community." </p>

<p><strong>Update: April 9, 2020</strong></p>

<p>The Athens City School District Board of Education will be meeting on April 16, 2020 at 6:30 P.M. to conduct the Districts’ Regular Board Meeting.  Consistent with the Order and directives from the Director of the Ohio Department of Health and Governor related to COVID-19, and Am. Sub. H.B. 197, this meeting will be conducted virtually.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The public is invited to join the virtual meeting by teleconference or video conference using the following information:<br><br><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Zoom Link: https://zoom.us/j/519412691<br>

<p><br>
In order to accommodate public participation, anyone wishing to provide comment to the Board must notify Dr. Thomas Gibbs at 740-797-4544 ext. 1201 or <a href="mailto:tgibbs@athenscsd.org">tgibbs@athenscsd.org</a> no later than 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, April 15, 2020.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: April 6, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Please be reminded that school meal deliveries will arrive tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow's meal delivery will consist of two meals for Tuesday and two meals for Wednesday.  The next meal delivery day will be Thursday, April 9th.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Last evening I was happy to announce that hotspot devices were in route.  Today I was disappointed to receive packages from UPS that included cellular SIM Cards, but no devices.  I've spoken with our T-Mobile representative in Columbus who was as surprised as I was.  He was not aware they had broken the shipment into two deliveries, one each for the SIM Cards and a second for the devices themselves.  We remain hopeful that devices will arrive any day.  Our tech team will begin set up and delivery as quickly as possible after they arrive.  I know this is frustrating for our students and families who do not have home internet and I sincerely apologize for the delay.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I have heard many positive comments from our students and families who were able to interact with their teachers and peers today in online learning.  I am hopeful we can make the most of a difficult situation in the coming weeks.  Please remember that goal #1 this week is for our students and teachers to connect.  In education, we often talk of the 3 R's: Relationships, Relevance, and Rigor.  This week's focus is primarily on establishing digital relationships and working to determine what lessons are relevant to our students given all that is happening in their lives at this time. Academic rigor will increase in the coming weeks.  We need to take the time to assure as many students as possible have access to these educational tools and opportunities before moving too far ahead.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As always, the team at the Athens City School District appreciates your patience and understanding.  We all hope your families are well, physically, mentally, and emotionally.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: April 5, 2020</strong></p>

<p>I received confirmation from T-Mobile early this morning that our WiFi hotspots should arrive in Athens by the end of the work day tomorrow.  Our team will begin configuring the hotspots as quickly as possible and hope to begin getting them out to families by Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: April 3, 2020</strong></p>

<p>As of this afternoon district personnel have distributed 1,842 Chromebooks to students.  Hundreds of those were hand delivered by paraprofessionals and members of our administrative team.  We still have a small list of students who we very recently received requests for or who we have not been able to contact.  Our team will continue to make every effort to assure our students have the devices they need to participate in online instruction.<br><br>
As of today, the hotspots that were ordered have not arrived.  It appears many districts ordered devices in a very short period of time and therefore deliveries are delayed as manufacturers work to fulfill all of the orders.  Despite this small setback, it is our intention to begin online instruction on Monday, April 6th.  In an effort to provide some internet access while we wait for the arrival of the mobile hotspots, our technology team is relocating wireless access points in our school buildings today to create drive-up internet access in parking lots at each building location.  We will have maps of those parking lot locations out early next week. We will be asking teachers to check in with students who do not respond or participate in online classes next week to keep students connected with school as much as possible until the hotspots can be delivered to families.</p>

<p><br>
Our teachers have asked me to remind students and families that students should begin checking email each day and should be looking for invitations to class meetings, Google Classroom or Canvas lessons, and general correspondence from their teachers.  It is important with online learning for each student to be responsible in routinely checking for communications from school.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Athens County Sheriff's Department and DARE Officer Jimmy Childs have asked me to share that they will be distributing snack bags for Athens County children at the Athens Walmart on Monday, April 6th from 11 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on a first come basis.<br>
 </p>

<p>The Athens City Schools Food Pantry will be open at Chauncey on Wednesday, April 8th from 3-5 p.m. with a focus on personal care items.  This will be a drive up distribution of items in front of the main entrance to the Chauncey building on Birge Drive.</p>

<p><br>
Today I'd like to highlight our School Maintenance and Custodial Team and thank them for all they have been doing to assist with meal preparation and assuring that teachers and Food Service Staff who continue to report to our buildings have a safe environment.  They have been working daily to clean and disinfect our food preparation areas and any classrooms and offices where secretaries and teachers have worked throughout the day.  Thank you to these members of our Athens Bulldogs Team for all of your hard work!</p>

<p><br>
Our teachers are very much looking forward to spending more time, albeit at a distance, with our students next week. The focus in the first week of online classes will be on establishing connections with students and assuring students can use the technology they have available.  As time progresses, more lessons will be added, however it is important in this first week that we assure as many students as possible are able to access the coursework.  Thank you to all of our students and families for your patience and support as we begin online instruction!</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: April 1, 2020</strong></p>

<div>Each day we are reviewing our procedures to make every effort to limit the exposure of our staff.  In an effort to allow more of our employees to refrain from coming onsite to work, we will be reducing the number of days per week for meal delivery.  Tomorrow morning, each student will receive three student meal bags, one each for tomorrow, Friday and Monday.  Each bag contains items for one breakfast and one lunch.  The next meal delivery will be on Tuesday morning, April 7th.  Reducing the number of times meals are delivered will decrease the number of times our Food Service, Transportation, and Paraprofessional staff have to leave their homes and interact with others.  Thank you for your understanding as we work to allow for our own staff to physically distance as much as possible.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>School administrators have been contacting families who still need Chromebooks to arrange for delivery.  We are very close to having all Chromebook devices delivered to students.  Unfortunately, our order of hotspots did not arrive today.  I will continue to be in contact with our provider and we have a team of technology specialists ready to configure the devices as soon as they arrive.  I will keep everyone updated as to our progress.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>This week we have received many requests for access to Infinite Campus accounts that were not accessible because school fees have not been paid.  Today, all Infinite Campus portal restrictions were lifted for the remainder of the academic year.  We want to assure that all families have online access to their student's records during the time that we are providing distance education.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Another topic of concern has been that of Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten enrollments and screening, as well as the annual applications for Intra-District and Inter-District Open Enrollment.  Our team is in the process of switching these applications over to an online format through Final Forms.  Parents with students who participate in athletics are already familiar with this online process.  We will be migrating our academic forms over to Final Forms in the next two weeks.  As soon as applications are available, a notice will be sent out to all families and posted on our website.  There may be some components of applications and enrollments, such as copies of photo identifications for parents and signature pages for open enrolled students that will need to occur at the start of next school year.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The Athens City Schools Food Pantry will be open next Wednesday, April 8th from 3-5 p.m. for the distribution of personal care items such as shampoo, soap, and other personal hygiene products.  We will use a drive by pick-up on Birge Drive near the front entrance to the Chauncey building.  We will ask that families pull up to the curb, wait to be asked to exit the vehicle, pick up their items, and return to the vehicle.  The effort will be to reduce close interaction as much as possible.  We have received over $5500 in donations to the Pantry in the past two weeks and will be working to have food and personal care item pickups every couple of weeks while we our under the Stay At Home order from the Governor's Office.  Thank you to everyone who is supporting this effort!</div>

<p><strong>Update: March 30, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Earlier today Governor DeWine announced that schools in Ohio will remain closed through May 1st.  For the Athens City School District, this closure shall include all athletic programs, extracurricular activities and use of school buildings and grounds by any entities.  Any previously approved building or grounds use between now and May 4th is officially revoked.  I would expect an announcement from the Ohio High School Athletic Association in the next few days regarding how this new order may impact Spring sports programming.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Please accept my sincere wishes for good health for all of our students and families.</p>

Please be reminded that we have a few more steps to get through before we can go “live” with our online instruction.  To date, we have distributed over 1800 Chromebooks to students.  We have nearly 250 students who still need Chromebooks and internet access.  Hotspot devices for internet connectivity are expected to arrive by Wednesday, at which time we will immediately begin configuring and delivering devices.  I know it has been some time since our students were in school, however it is important that we assure the most students possible have access before beginning online instruction.<br><br>
For hundreds of our students in grades PK-2, this may be the first time students have been assigned a google account.  Tammy Hawk emailed parents the access information last week.  If you have an email on file with us and did not see the message, please check your “spam” or “junk mail” folders to look for this message.  If you still cannot locate the message, or if you have any other difficulties in accessing your student’s Google accounts, please email us at <a href="mailto:google@athenscsd.org">google@athenscsd.org</a>.<br><br>
For tech questions related to the Chromebook device itself, please contact our technology department at <a href="mailto:acs.techhelp@athenscsd.org">acs.techhelp@athenscsd.org</a> or call 740-797-4544 x 1229.<br><br>
For questions about creating or accessing your parent or student portal for Infinite Campus, please email us at <a href="mailto:campus@athenscsd.org">campus@athenscsd.org</a>.<br><br>
Our team is working day and night to get issues resolved so that as many students as possible have access before we officially begin online instruction.  Realistically, given the delivery of hotspots and Chromebooks and getting all of our students access to our online platforms, it is likely we will not officially begin online instruction until Monday, April 6th.  While the Governor has not officially closed school beyond the end of this week, the information we have been provided leads us to believe that we will not be returning to school for at least a few more weeks.<br><br>
This week you should expect that teachers will reach out to students and families to test out email, google-classroom, Zoom, and Canvas access either via digital methods or telephone.<br><br>
If you’d like to take this week to explore and learn on your own, I would recommend the virtual tours on the State of Ohio website at <a href="https://ohio.org/lets-get-digital-virtual-attractions-activities">https://ohio.org/lets-get-digital-virtual-attractions-activities</a>.  Additionally, Audible has offered multiple free audio books for children at different reading levels and in several world languages at <a href="https://stories.audible.com/start-listen">https://stories.audible.com/start-listen</a>.<br><br>
Our team appreciates your patience as we arrange for online instruction.  I will provide an update in a couple of days as to where we are in the process.  Until then, I hope families who already have devices and internet take the time to explore and learn on your own.</p>

<p><br>
We have had many calls asking if students may retrieve items form lockers or desks at school.  Our team has been very busy assuring that students have school meals and in making sure students have Chromebook and internet access.  Once we know more about the Governor’s position regarding an extension of the “stay at home” order, we will make arrangements for students to retrieve items from school.  Teachers will be planning lessons in the short term with the understanding that students may not have access to the same materials they might typically have in the classroom.<br><br>
We have also received multiple questions about picking up items related to PTO and other fundraisers.  To assure the safety of our staff who need to work at the buildings on a daily basis to prepare and deliver meals to students, we will not be permitting distribution of those items at this time.  Once we have a better idea of the Governor’s position regarding any extension of the “stay at home” order, we will make a decision as to the best manner of proceeding with pick up of these items.<br><br>
Our team greatly appreciates your support and understanding as we work through the many challenges of delivering instruction at a distance.  We believe strongly that the preparation on the front end will provide for a better delivery of services.  Thank you for your continued patience and support.</p>

<p><strong>Update: March 27, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Over 600 Chromebooks were distributed to families yesterday afternoon.  With the over 700 Chromebooks already in the hands of Athens High School students, that brings the total number of devices distributed to over 1300!  We still have approximately 600 students who have indicated they need a Chromebook.  Please be reminded that we will have another pick-up time today at East-West Elementary School, Athens Middle School, and The Plains Elementary School from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.  On Monday we will begin delivery to those students who are not able to come to the pickup locations today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Parents of Preschool, Kindergarten and First Grade students who have an email address on file with us should have received an email with directions for signing into your child’s school Google account. That same information will be mailed to homes of students for whom we have no parent email address on file.  If you have internet at home, please go ahead and sign into the device and set up your child’s email.  As of today, we are still expecting to receive the mobile hotspots we have ordered by the middle of next week, at which time we will immediately begin setup and delivery.  I will provide periodic updates and let you know when we are ready to go live with our online instruction.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you do have home internet and Chromebooks, feel free to go ahead and use the devices and explore topics and websites of interest on your own.  Please be aware that devices owned by the Athens City School District will automatically be directed through our cloud based internet content filters.  This filtering is used to provide a level of assurance that children will not be accidently exposed to inappropriate content.  Please also be aware that content filtering is not perfect and some level of parent or adult supervision is required to assure your child is safely using their device and connectivity.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I want to end today’s message by thanking our Food Service Staff, Paraprofessionals, Bus Drivers and Maintenance and Custodial Team for all the work they have done this week.  The District has provided over 5000 meals to families and is getting very close to being able to provide online instruction to over 2500 students because of the hard work of our classified staff.  If you know any of them, thank them. We couldn’t operate on a daily basis without this team of hard working and caring adults.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Please accept my wishes of good health to each of you and your families.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 25, 2020</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The District has now been through three days of school meal deliveries and we continue to iron out some kinks.  If you have requested meal delivery and have not yet had meals delivered to you, please email your school principal or call the school office and leave a message.  While district staff are mostly working remotely, voice messages left at the schools are being forwarded to building secretaries and administrators.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The District will begin distribution of Chromebooks tomorrow morning, however we will need to modify our original plan in order to expedite the process.  We’ve had an overwhelming response for requests for Chromebooks, with nearly 1200 individual students asking for devices.  This is great, but makes for a difficult job of delivering them all door to door by school bus.  We are asking that families who are able to do so, come to one of three locations for a drive-through Chromebook pick-up between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. tomorrow and Friday.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Distribution of Chromebooks will be based on the area of the District in which you live, regardless of your grade level. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you live in the Morrison-Gordon attendance area, you will come to Athens Middle School to pick up your Chromebook.  Please pull up the driveway from Lancaster street and through the main parking lot and playground and then exit onto High Street.  We will have personnel directing traffic.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Distribution of Chromebooks for the East-West attendance area will occur at East-West in the rear of the building.  Please pull in the back driveway and create a loop around the parking area and pull up at the back doors and then exit the back driveway.  We will have personnel to assist in directing traffic.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Distribution of Chromebooks for The Plains attendance area will occur at The Plains Elementary School in the main drive at the front of the building.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Our team will be as efficient and quick as possible in handing off devices to families.  We ask that you be patient with us and remain in your vehicle.  The goal is to practice physical distancing and to have as little direct contact as possible.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Any families unable to pick up Chromebooks themselves will be contacted on Monday to arrange alternative delivery.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Students in Grades PK, K, and 1 will also be receiving directions via parent email addresses as to their login and password for Gmail and Google Classroom.  If we do not have an email address available, a hard copy of this information will be mailed or delivered to your home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Our faculty has been busy this week learning to use various functions in Google, Canvas, and Zoom.  Online coursework will begin after we have received and delivered internet devices to families without internet next week.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Again, we appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding as we work through the steps to assure the greatest equity for lesson delivery for all of our students and families.</p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 22, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Tomorrow morning, the district will be making a first delivery of school meals to students at home.  Please be reminded that deliveries will occur between 8:15 and 9:30 am. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For the safety of both our employees and our students, we ask that families allow our employees to leave the meals on the porch or another location and that the face-to-face interaction be limited. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>School personnel will also be disinfecting and cleaning Chromebooks tomorrow for delivery later this week. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At this point, mobile hotspots are on order, and should be in by the 1st of April.  I will update families when we intend to deliver Chromebooks and hot spots to make sure an adult is home the day we deliver and can confirm receipt of the devices.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>You may have heard that the governor put in place today a stay home order.  School meal delivery is exempt from this order.  It is our intention to continue this service as long as possible.  I would like to encourage families to stay at home as much as possible and to only go out when absolutely necessary. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Any staff members who have traveled over spring break are encouraged to self-report to your supervisor and self-quarantine for at least 14 days from the date of your last travel.  I want to thank everyone for following restrictions that are in place.  These measures are for the safety of all members of our community.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As Governor Dewine and Dr. Amy Adkins pointed out in their comments today, we can define how the course of this pandemic proceeds.  If we follow the guidelines, we can create a safer environment for everyone in our community.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I will continue to provide updates every few days.  Thank you for your continued patience and support.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 19, 2020</strong></p>

<p>I would like to thank our parents who submitted online surveys and our teachers and staff who made phone calls today to provide me with as accurate information as possible to make decisions about how best to move forward as a district.<br>
 <br>
Preliminary results from surveys indicate that we have approximately 16% of our student population without home internet.  We have a plan in place to address this gap and I am working with vendors to place an equipment order.  I have been informed that it may be the end of March before that equipment is delivered.  In an effort to be as prepared as possible for the date when we can be assured that our students all have basic internet access, we will be working on the following items over the next week:<br>
 <br>
Tomorrow, Food Service Staff will begin preparing sack breakfasts and lunches for a first delivery on Monday, March 23rd.  It is our intention to leave the schools with meals at approximately 8:15 a.m. and to deliver those meals to the homes where they have been requested between 8:30 and 9:30 a.m.  I will determine if these deliveries will be daily or every few days after more closely reviewing our survey data tomorrow.  This information will be shared out as quickly as possible.<br>
 <br>
After these delivery routes are established, we will use the same routing system to bring Chromebooks to each student who has requested one.  I would expect we could begin Chromebook deliveries on March 25th, however I will provide phone call updates the night before any deliveries to assure parents are aware when the devices will arrive.<br>
 <br>
Teachers will begin online professional development to use Google Classroom, Canvas, and Zoom next week and prepare lessons for a potential start the week of March 30th.  Please be aware that in order to provide the greatest equity of educational access to all of our families, we will not officially begin online education until such time that internet equipment is delivered and up and running.  This may mean that the originally planned start date of March 30th is delayed to accommodate this step in the process.  Again, I will provide periodic updates so families are aware where we are in the process.<br>
 <br>
This is an unprecedented time in our history, but we can all work together to make the best experience possible for our children.  I would ask that families turn off the news and TV and not over-expose children to the negativity surrounding the news coverage of the current pandemic.  Take the time to read books together, talk about your hobbies and interests, research an interesting topic, write a poem or story, or just get outside and take a walk.  Contact your loved ones who may need to be more isolated because of their health risks and don’t forget to support your small local businesses by ordering carryout or picking up a cup of coffee or tea. <br>
 <br>
I am personally grateful to live in such a caring and thoughtful community.  Thank you for your continued patience and support as we work to reconfigure how we deliver education to our students.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 16, 2020</strong></p>

<p>It is important that parents/guardians complete <strong data-redactor-tag="strong"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/covid-19-closure-student-needs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">THIS SURVEY</a> </strong>as quickly as possible.<br>
 </p>

<p>We are working on a plan to begin meal deliveries on Monday, March 23rd and to begin remote instruction on March 30th.  Those who can respond online, please do so as quickly as possible.  For those who do not have access and have not responded online we will begin making phone contacts by Thursday morning.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In addition to sharing this information, I wanted to communicate to members of our community that this Thursday's Board Meeting is cancelled. Our next Board Meeting will be on Thursday, April 16th.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Also, we wanted families to know that the Athens City School District Food Pantry in Chauncey will be open on Wednesday from 4-5:30 p.m.  When you arrive, please remain in your vehicle.  One bag of food per family will be brought to the vehicle.  Drivers should enter Hubie Bobo Lane from Birge Drive and exit through the stadium driveway.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I have received many calls and emails from people asking how they can help.  If you are interested in supporting the Athens City School District Food Pantry, please mail checks to the Athens City School District Office c/o Tom Gibbs and make checks payable to the Athens City School District Food Pantry.  The mailing address is P.O. Box 9, Chauncey, Ohio 45719.<br>
 </p>

<p>Lastly, faculty and staff will want to routinely check email, as specific instructions and updates will be sent out over the course of the week.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Our team members appreciate everyone's patience and understanding as we work through these details.  Additional information and updates will be provided as they become available.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 15, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Updated INTRA-District 20-21 Open Enrollment Dates: April 13-23, 2020 - Details regarding registration will be forthcoming.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 13, 2020</strong></p>

<p>All school offices and the district central office will be closed Monday, March 16th - Wednesday, March 18th.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 12, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Please be aware that Governor Mike Dewine announced today that he is closing ALL SCHOOLS in the State of Ohio for three weeks beginning the end of the day, Monday, March 16th.  This decision effectively increases the two-week school closing that I announced earlier this week. As a result of the Governor’s decision, please be aware that the Athens City School District will now be closed through Friday, April 3, 2020.  Again, the Athens City School District will be closed through Friday, April 3, 2020.<br>
 <br>
In addition to schools being closed, there will be no practices, meetings, activities or events between now and April 6, 2020.  Earlier today I also cancelled all out of state and overnight trips between now and the end of the school year.  These trips include the Athens High School Band Trip to Nashville, the Athens Middle School Washington D.C. Trip, the East-West Elementary School Gettysburg Trip, The Plains Elementary School Camp Akita Trip and the Regional Scholars Program.  Given the extended time period students will not be in school, I will be reviewing all other field trips over the next week and will be imposing additional cancellations.<br>
 <br>
Our buildings are closed during this time to any use by outside groups.  This would include any childcare programs, camps, youth organizations, community athletic programs, or other groups that routinely use our buildings for pick-up games, programming, or other activities.  The decision to close the schools is based on the principal of social distancing.  For this reason, we must protect the integrity of the decision by not allowing other groups to utilize our facilities for group activities.  This directive is in place until further notice.  Any previously approved building use between now and April 6th is officially rescinded.<br>
 <br>
Due to contractual obligations related to calamity days, teachers and other employees will not be working next week.  As a result, we will be in planning the week of March 23rd in regards to meal and food deliveries and determining if online instruction is feasible and to what extent.<br>
 <br>
I know that there will be many questions.  Unfortunately, at this very moment I do not have answers finalized.  As decisions are made and information becomes available, I will communicate to our families.<br>
 </p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding as we work through the specific details of this closure.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: March 10, 2020</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, March 8th Governor DeWine issued a state of emergency following the positive identification of three persons with the COVID-19 virus in Cuyahoga County.  In press statements today, the Governor has advised Universities to suspend face-to-face classes and use online instruction.  Ohio University has announced their intention to provide instruction online from March 16th to March 30th, with face-to-face classes to resume on March 30th.<br>
 </p>

<p>In response to this new information, Superintendents from Athens and Meigs County, Logan-Hocking, the Beacon School and the Tri-County Career Center met with Dr. James Gaskell and Jack Pepper from the Athens City-County Health Department to discuss how our K-12 educational institutions should respond to limit the spread of the virus.<br>
 </p>

<p>As a result of that meeting, it has been decided that the Athens City School District will be closed beginning March 16th and will reopen for face-to-face classes beginning on March 30th.  During this time, all practices, meetings, and events will be cancelled with the exception of the Board Meeting on March 19th.  With our proximity to Ohio University and the many families connected to the University, it is very likely that many families traveled over the spring break and may have become exposed to COVID-19.  Given the knowledge that the virus may incubate for up to 14 days, this period of time off from school will limit the possibility for student exposure and transmission of the virus.  While the Governor is not recommending that K-12 schools close, Athens is unique given the large proportion of our families associated with the University and the situation related to travel over the Spring Break period.  Other area districts without this direct connection to Ohio University may choose to remain open at this time.<br>
 </p>

<p>The missed school days will be accounted for in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use 3 remaining calamity days.</li>
	<li>Make up 2 days on April 10th and April 13th.</li>
	<li>Recommend to the Board of Education to change the student calendar to allow for the remaining 5 days to be for teacher work days and not counted as student attendance hours.  This is possible because our students attend school for many hours beyond the state requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p>12-month staff and administration should continue to report to work and offices will remain open at this time.  Additional information regarding when 9 month staff should report and other restrictions will be provided in the coming days.  Thank you for your understanding of our need to make this decision.</p></span>
