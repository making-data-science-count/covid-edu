<h2>Current Information</h2>
<h3>4/17/20</h3>
<p>NCSD Stakeholders,</p>
<p>As you likely know, Governor Reynolds held a press conference this morning and ordered schools to remain closed through the remainder of the school year. Although this decision is in the best interest of the health and safety of our learning community, it certainly creates a great deal of uncertainty as we consider wrapping up a school year in a very unconventional manner. I want to assure the Nevada Community that we will continue to walk alongside you throughout this unprecedented journey.</p>
<p>This school closure has been far from ideal and I know that you have many questions. We have attempted to answer some of those below.  I know this situation has offered some tremendous challenges to students, parents and staff members. Please accept my deepest appreciation to those that have agreed to partner with us during this most difficult time. The way everyone in this community has rallied around our students and families is the epitome of Nevada Cub Pride.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least, my heart goes out to the 2020 Senior Class. This doesn’t seem fair and I’m sorry this has caused such a distraction to your last year as a Nevada Cub. Just remember, “Once a Cub, Always a Cub”! Please know you are special to us and we will work hard to honor you and celebrate you for all of your accomplishments.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Steve Gray, Superintendent</p>
<h4><strong>FAQ</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Will the District continue to offer <em>Voluntary Educational Enrichment Opportunities</em> at the PK-8 levels?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the District will continue to offer online and hard copy resources to students and parents through the end of the school year (June 3).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will the District be moving towards <em>Required Educational Services</em> for High School classes to finish the year?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Administration and staff have been preparing to move NHS courses completely online and <em>Required Educational Services</em> will be the recommendation to the School Board on Monday, April 20. Plans and logistics were communicated to NHS students and parents the afternoon of 4/17/20.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Why aren’t <em>Required Educational Services</em> being offered at the Middle School Level?</strong>
<ul>
<li>There are many logistical and legal reasons preventing the District from taking that step at this time:
<ul>
<li>There are equity issues and barriers that must be overcome to offer required instruction
<ul>
<li>Special Education/504 and English Language Learner accommodations</li>
<li>Internet Accessibility</li>
<li>Device Accessibility – repair due to supply chain issues (parts often come from China); replacement is limited to the reserve devices that we have in our inventory</li>
<li>Age/Independent Learners – Providing grade-appropriate instruction in a remote learning environment creates different challenges for various ages of learners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While we know that we cannot overcome all of these barriers PK-12 with over 1,500 learners, we believe we are now prepared to offer required instruction to our 450 most independent and self-directed students to finish second semester credits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What about Graduation, Prom, National Honor Society Induction Ceremony, High School Awards/Scholarship Ceremony, etc.?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The District plans to honor all of these important events and details will be communicated next week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Is there now a chance that my child will be held back at their current grade level?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unless you were contacted by your child’s teacher prior to our closure, your child will be promoted to their next grade level in the fall. We will work with all students when we return to school to fill in the gaps left by our time away from school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If another closure is required at some point next fall could other grade levels be added to the required online platform?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Possibly. The District will be researching and preparing for this throughout the spring and summer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will the curbside meal program continue throughout the spring and summer?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is the District’s intent to continue the program into August unless otherwise directed by State or Federal guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Given that the Governor waived the August 23 school start date, will the district plan to start school earlier than the current August 24 indicated on the 2020-2021 school calendar?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is not likely. Given that we do not yet know what June-July will bring in regard to COVID-19 regulations, it would be difficult to communicate a new start date to families and staff with such short notice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>My child still has personal items at the school. When and how can those be retrieved?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The District will provide guidance for this soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>How long will students keep their Chromebooks?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The District will communicate a turn-in date for Seniors sometime after July 3. All other students with Chromebooks will keep them throughout the summer. Grades 9-11 will exchange for a new device on the first day of school in August. The District will communicate with Middle School students to ensure that all devices are repaired for the first day back in the fall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will the district now distribute devices to elementary students?</strong>
<ul>
<li>At this time, we will not be issuing devices to elementary students to maintain reserve devices for our High School students completing required coursework.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>When can I get my child’s yearbook?</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is to be determined, but yearbooks will likely be distributed when school resumes in August.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will the ‘Food for Thought’ program still happen as scheduled this summer?</strong>
<ul>
<li>To be determined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will we offer Elementary summer school as planned in August?</strong>
<ul>
<li>To be determined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will Boys and Girls Club summer programming still happen?</strong>
<ul>
<li>To be determined.</li>

<h2>Past  Information</h2>
<hr>
<h3>4/2/20</h3>
<p>NCSD Stakeholders,</p>
<p>This afternoon, Governor Reynolds held a press conference extending the school closure period until April 30. Since the Governor’s initial recommendation to close schools on March 15, we have desired to return to our schools. We miss our students and the daily joy that they bring us. But for the safety of our students, teachers, and community, we agree and appreciate the Governor’s recommendation to close schools. As a result, <strong>the Nevada Community School District will be closed through April 30.</strong> This includes, but is not limited to, all school buildings, extra-curricular activities, community events, as well as athletic practices and competitions. We further ask that our playgrounds not be used as the equipment is not disinfected.</p>
<h4><strong>Summary of District Action</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The administration directed a safe and orderly process for staff and students to get essential items from the buildings. The buildings have been disinfected and will remain closed to all with the exception of select staff deemed essential to current operations.</li>
<li>An emergency meal program was established to provide breakfast and lunch to any child age 18 or younger. Services through the District’s food pantry (Cubbies Cupboard) and Backpack Meal Program have also been extended.</li>
<li>Families were provided optional learning resources to use during the closure. Following the initial release of optional learning resources to families, staff began working additionally to provide more targeted resources which continue to be updated regularly.</li>
<li>Staff are working hard to stay connected with students on a weekly basis during closure.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Department of Education Guidance on Continuous Learning</strong></h4>
<p>Since before spring break, we started curating resources that we quickly developed into a <u><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ncsddigital/home">Digital Learning Resources website</a></u>. These online engagement materials followed guidance at the time from the Iowa Department of Education that encouraged districts to provide engagement materials to students without requiring participation.</p>
<p>New guidance from the Department of Education (April 2) is providing public districts with two continuous learning options. The first is <em>Voluntary Educational Enrichment Opportunities</em>, where student participation is voluntary and no grading or credit is given.</p>
<p>The other option is <em>Required Educational Services </em>where continuous learning ensures that academic work is equivalent to typical classroom work. Instruction would be provided online and students are required to participate, attendance is taken, work is graded, and credit granted.</p>
<p>All public districts are required to indicate which method of continuous learning they will use from April 13 through April 30 by submitting their responses no later than April 10. Districts may combine the two options as a hybrid delivery method for different grade levels in any way that best serves the needs of their students.</p>
<p>During this school closure period, we have been actively exploring what continuing education looks like in Nevada. This has included how we deliver education, determining what it looks like at each level, and how we can support teachers and buildings in this endeavor. We have also been considering challenges related to equity and access, as well as how we serve students with special needs.</p>
<p>Although we have been at work knowing that this extended school closure was a possibility, we had not been informed about what would be required of Districts until this afternoon. With the Governor’s announcement today, we will be moving forward with additional plans based on their guidance. Issues regarding equity, access, credit, graduation, state, and post-secondary requirements will lead our initial efforts towards planning for <em>Required Educational Services</em> at the High School level, and <em>Voluntary Educational Enrichment Opportunities</em> at the PK-8 level.</p>
<h4><strong>Template for Continuous Learning</strong></h4>
<p>As part of their guidance this afternoon, the Department of Education provided districts a template for continuous learning. Designed to use locally, the areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define Teacher and Student Expectations</li>
<li>Identify Your Delivery Platforms</li>
<li>Communicate with Internal and External Stakeholders</li>
<li>Ensure Professional Development</li>
<li>Define and Ensure Student Access</li>
</ul>
<p>We have taken the last couple of weeks to incorporate many of these areas. Our immediate next steps include vetting the new guidance to develop an ongoing plan for teaching and learning to best meet the needs of students as developmentally and age appropriate in this new environment.</p>
<p>Linked here is <a href="https://educateiowa.gov/documents/pk-12/2020/04/covid-19-guidance-procedures-continuous-learning">guidance that the Department of Education released today</a>. On a webinar call this afternoon, it was noted that additional FAQ guidance will soon be provided.</p>
<p>With this extended closure period, we know that there will be a lot of questions. The past two weeks have introduced a career-defining time for most educators and we are committed to maintaining our increased level of communication with stakeholders. Above all, know that the Nevada District, more than ever, is both honored and humbled to be of service to our children and community. Our thoughts are with all who are experiencing hardship. We are committed to stand together and we will get through this!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Dr. Steve Gray, Superintendent<br>

<h3>3/16/20</h3>
<p>Nevada CSD Stakeholders,</p>
<p>We recognize there are a number of questions and concerns as related to COVID-19 and how our school district will navigate this health crisis. This dynamic situation has offered plenty of challenges to be accurate and timely with new developments. By the hour, we continue to receive new guidance from a variety of local, state and federal agencies.</p>
<p>The State of Iowa is recommending that Iowa school districts close for four weeks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This recommendation comes as guidance from the Iowa Department of Public Health. As a result, <strong>Nevada Schools will be closed for the recommended period of time and is tentatively scheduled to reopen on <u>Monday, April 13, 2020</u></strong>.</p>
<p>I know there are many questions regarding our announcement of closure. The rate in which this COVID-19 situation is unfolding is unprecedented in our time, and fluid in nature. A few frequently asked questions are addressed below:</p>
<p><strong>Will we provide online (e-learning) to our students during the closure?<br></strong>No, while we are equipped to provide this service in many areas, we are not currently equipped to provide this service equitably for all students. The District will provide online resources to students and parents to use at their discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Will the District provide meals to students during the closure?<br></strong>Yes, it is our intent to offer sack lunches for pickup during the closure. The District is in the process of gaining State approval and will communicate the logistics of meal orders and distribution as soon as plans are finalized. The District is also working through logistics to continue the Backpack Meal Program and Cubbies Cupboard (food pantry).</p>
<p><strong>My child’s medication is at school. Can I get this and/or other personal belongings?<br></strong>Yes, please call your school’s office to arrange a pickup time.</p>
<p><strong>Will schools be required to make up days lost due to the closure?<br></strong>Indications are that the State will provide discretion regarding the required 1080 hours of instruction currently required. The District will adhere to requirements as determined by the Iowa Department of Education.</p>
<p><strong>How will the District complete state and federally mandated assessments?<br></strong>Indications are that a waiver will be granted.</p>
<p><strong>What are childcare options in Nevada?<br></strong>The Nevada Community School District, City of Nevada, Mainstreet Nevada, and Nevada Economic Development Council are currently discussing possibilities to link willing private providers with families in need. Any childcare transaction would be between the willing provider and family in need, but the school district can serve the public as the primary source of information.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding. We all have many questions, information is developing rapidly, and guidance is changing daily. We will work together as a community to overcome these challenges.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Dr. Steve Gray, Nevada Superintendent</p>

<h3>3/15/20</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Tonight, Governor Reynolds announced that she is recommending that Iowa school districts close for four weeks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This recommendation comes from guidance from the Iowa Department of Public Health and based on CDC guidelines. Tomorrow, March 16, she will hold a press conference that more clearly outlines school closure expectations, such as expected dates of closure and re-opening. At the time of this message, a time for the press conference had not yet been announced. We will provide updates as they are available to us regarding school closure and other pertinent information.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Nevada Community School District will follow the advice and cancel all programs, activities, and classes effective March 17, 2020.</b> This includes outside organizations who access our buildings including Nevada Community Resource Center (NCRC).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Nevada Community School District is on a scheduled Spring Break this upcoming week, March 16 – 20. We will keep you updated as we find out more information that will help you plan for the coming weeks.</p>

<h3>3/13/20</h3>
<p><strong>Central Iowa School Districts Unify on COVID-19 Crisis</strong></p>
<p>In light of recent university and public-school closures, many central Iowa school district leaders met Friday, March 13, to collaborate and develop a consistent message for our broader communities. Representatives from the Governor’s Office and other educational agencies were also present. <strong>At this time, we believe it is in the best interest of our families and staff to resume school as planned after spring break (Monday, March 23, 2020)</strong>.</p>
<p>Student and staff safety remains our top priority. We all look to the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) for their expertise and direction. IDPH currently believes the risk to our student and staff population is low. We also acknowledge many of our families rely on district-provided childcare and nutritional resources.</p>
<p>We will continue to partner with IDPH and follow their standard protocol for reportable illnesses. This may result in a need to close a specific building, district, or region of schools. IDPH will be the primary source for how we make our decisions regarding COVID-19.</p>
<p>In addition to IDPH, we are in communication with Story County Public Health and the Iowa Department of Education (IDE). Central Iowa school districts will continue to follow the guidance of these agencies and work together to keep students, families, and staff safe and informed.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>
<p>Where you get your information about this virus is important. Look for information from reliable and trusted experts. Social media posts often report partial or inaccurate information.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do To Help</strong></p>
<p>Families and community members can help by following these simple, easy steps that help prevent the spread of ALL contagious viruses, including COVID-19. Practice the same routine hygiene used to help prevent the cold and flu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequently wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soapy water. If unavailable, use hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all a healthy and enjoyable spring break.</p>
<p>Dr. Steve Gray, NCSD Superintendent</p>

<h3>3/12/20</h3>
<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>Information has recently been published from the Des Moines Public School District regarding their plan to close schools and resume all classes on Monday, March 30. While their spring break is a part of this time off, it does include two additional days out of school for their students in response to COVID-19 (staff had PD planned for March 23-25).</p>
<p>It is important to know that the Department of Public Health is not, at this time, recommending school closures. We are expecting an announcement and guidance from the Iowa Department of Education and the Department of Public Health regarding schools and COVID-19 tomorrow. This is a very dynamic situation and information will change over time. We will communicate information to our staff and families as it becomes available. We encourage you to review this <a href="https://www.nevadacubs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/K12-Guidance_03.12.20.pdf">PK-12 School Guidance document</a> from the Iowa Department of Public Health that was provided to us.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Dr. Steve Gray, NCSD Superintendent</p>
