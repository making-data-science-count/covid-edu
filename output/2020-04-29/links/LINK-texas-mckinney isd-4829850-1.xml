<p>4/24 Update - Beginning April 27, Malvern Elementary and McNeil Elementary will no longer be used as pick-up locations for the MISD Grab &amp; Go meal program. Valley Creek Elementary has been approved as a Grab &amp; Go site, and pick-ups will take place at Valley Creek’s back parking lot off of Eldorado Pkwy. <a href="https://www.mckinneyisd.net/health-services-wellness/coronavirus-covid-19/">Learn more</a></p>

<p>Governor Abbott issued an executive order on Friday, April 17, determining that Texas schools will remain closed through the remainder of the 2019–2020 school year. In accordance with that order, McKinney ISD will continue our school closure through the end of school on May 28. We will begin the next school year in August in accordance with the previously adopted 2020-2021 school calendar. <a href="https://www.mckinneyisd.net/news-events/newsletter/april-17-2020/">Learn more</a></p>

<p>Beginning Monday, April 27, <strong>Malvern Elementary and McNeil Elementary will no longer be used as pick-up locations</strong> for the MISD Grab &amp; Go meal program.</p>
<p>However, the Texas Department of Agriculture has approved the use of <strong>Valley Creek Elementary</strong> as a Grab &amp; Go site, and pick-ups will take place at Valley Creek’s back parking lot off of Eldorado Pkwy beginning Monday, April 27.</p>
<p>The change is due to planned renovations at Malvern and McNeil, and parents who have been picking up meals at those two schools will need to plan to visit any of the five other locations for meal pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>Grab &amp; Go Pick-up Locations</strong><br>
Vega Elementary—2511 Cattleman Dr., McKinney, TX 75071<br>

<p><strong>Daily Schedule</strong><br>
Lunch – 11 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. (receive that day’s lunch and next day’s breakfast)</p>

<p>Dear McKinney ISD Community,</p>
<p>I would like to begin by commending the efforts of our campus principals and teachers for their outstanding work in helping McKinney ISD prepare for and implement teacher-led digital learning that launched yesterday—and for the creative and heartfelt ways that they have reached out to their school communities during this time of school closure.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank you, MISD parents, for your patience and support as we move forward in this undertaking. The situation that we find ourselves in presents many challenges, but I am confident that we, as a district and as a community, will weather this storm and that our students will continue to learn and thrive in the midst of it.</p>
<p>In light of Governor Abbott’s executive order today extending closure of Texas schools, I want to inform you that MISD schools will remain closed through Friday, May 1.</p>
<p>Please know that our desire as a district is to get our students back on campus as soon as possible, but the spread of the novel coronavirus continues to advance in North Texas, other parts of the state and across the country, and we must wait until it is safe for students to return.</p>
<p>In today’s press conference, Governor Abbott stated that he would continue to monitor this ongoing situation and determine whether there is a need to further extend the suspension of normal district operations beyond May 1. Any decision to extend school closure or return students to campus will be communicated at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, teacher-directed digital learning will continue, and academic and social-emotional enrichment resources remain available online for students and families.</p>
<p>MISD personnel will continue to operate from home with on-site district activities limited to only the most essential operations.</p>
<p>MISD will stay connected with students and parents through communication from our elementary and secondary campuses, and classroom teachers will be the primary point of contact for information related to specific classes and online lessons. I hope that you have already been in contact with your child’s teachers, and I encourage you to communicate regularly with them.</p>
<p>As always, please visit the MISD homepage at <a href="https://www.mckinneyisd.net">www.mckinneyisd.net</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mckinneyschools/">MISD Facebook page</a> to receive the most current and accurate information about the extended closure and the district’s response to the COVID-19 health concern.</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to recognize the tireless work of our MISD technology department who have worked day and night for the past week and a half to gather, set up and distribute approximately 3,000 laptops so that all MISD families can have the opportunity to take part in digital learning at home.</p>
<p>The term “unprecedented” has perhaps been overused during the past few weeks, but it is difficult to find a word that more accurately describes the circumstances in which we find ourselves. In light of that, I encourage every member of the MISD community to find ways to encourage one another, support one another and live out the kindness that I believe sets McKinney ISD apart.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Dr. Rick McDaniel<br>
McKinney ISD Superintendent</p>

<p>Below is a link to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/mckinneyisd.net/misdenrichmentathome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MISD Enrichment@Home website</a> now available online. The site provides opportunities for student enrichment at home during the week of March 23-27 and will remain available throughout the school closure. As a reminder, beginning March 30, MISD will move into district-wide digital learning using the Seesaw platform for K-2nd grade and Canvas for 3rd-12th grade. The district will send additional details this week with instructions related to digital learning.</p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/mckinneyisd.net/misdenrichmentathome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sites.google.com/mckinneyisd.net/misdenrichmentathome</a></p>
<p>Students in McKinney ISD have extensive opportunities for continuing their studies during school closure. The Enrichment@home website provides grade-appropriate opportunities to review, continue, and extend learning while we are away from the classroom. This site will serve students in all grade levels and will be in conjunction with a district-wide online learning management system. If you have any questions please contact your campus administration or your child’s teacher(s).</p>
<h3>Thursday, March 19 Video Update</h3>
<p>McKinney ISD parents, we invite you to view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wdreNoJI8Y&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this important video message</a> from MISD Superintendent Dr. Rick McDaniel as he talks about the current status of the district and the steps that teachers and students will be taking in the days ahead as MISD implements a digital learning strategy to begin on Monday, March 30.</p>

<p>On Monday, March 23, MISD’s Grab &amp; Go meal program will continue to provide free breakfast and lunch to any MISD student, but the pick up schedule will change to one pick up time that will take place each day from 11 a.m.–12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Beginning Monday, March 23, students will pick up Grab &amp; Go meals only during the lunch time slot but will receive that day’s lunch and the following day’s breakfast. (See schedule below for how this impacts the Friday, March 20 pick ups.)</p>
<p>The Grab &amp; Go pick up locations remain the same: Vega, Malvern, Webb, Finch, McNeil and Slaughter. The Grab &amp; Go meals are still available free to any MISD student.</p>

<p>McKinney ISD schools will remain closed through Friday, April 3, 2020, in an effort to support the community, region and nation’s need to slow the spread of COVID-19. This action follows advice from local, state and national health authorities.</p>
<p>MISD will use the week of March 30–April 3 to reassess whether there is a need to extend the suspension of normal district operations beyond April 3 and will communicate a decision to the public at that time.</p>
<p>MISD will remain flexible as we roll out our long-term plan for instructional continuity and as we continue to navigate the many details of this unprecedented situation. Although our buildings remain closed to the public, we will continue to provide academic and social-emotional enrichment resources for our students and families. Before the end of the week, the district will communicate how students and families will be able to access those resources online beginning Monday, March 23.</p>

<p>McKinney ISD Parents,</p>
<p>We want to provide an update related to the recent school closures in McKinney ISD due to COVID-19.  In order to provide academic support and instruction, McKinney ISD has a short-term plan that will be implemented later this week that will provide tools for students and parents to utilize to reinforce previous learning and mitigate the short-term impact of the school closure. While we do not have a specific date determined when the schools will reopen, we are working diligently with teachers and instructional staff to determine a plan for providing instructional guidance and learning resources for parents during the closure.  We understand that many parents and students may be experiencing some level of anxiety, but I am confident that our amazing teachers and support staff will rise to the challenge.  This will require patience and support for our teachers as they navigate through the process of supporting learning at home.</p>
<p>You will be receiving information this week that gives guidance on how to access these resources and learning tools.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are some ways to keep your student engaged:</p>
<ul>
<li>McKinney ISD provides many digital tools to support in-class learning, and our students will have access to these resources which are aligned to their classes.  More information will be sent this week from your child’s teachers and campus regarding these resources.</li>
<li>Set aside time each day during the school closure for practice, extension and enrichment utilizing provided resources.</li>
<li>Choose something to read with your child, or provide time for self-selected reading every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be sending out additional information by the end of the day tomorrow, Wednesday, March 18 regarding the closure.  We know this is a difficult time for everyone and we appreciate your patience as our teachers and staff work towards an online solution.  We also appreciate your care and concern as we all work together to support each other during these unprecedented circumstances.</p>
<p>Dr. Rick McDaniel<br>
Superintendent of Schools<br>

<h3>Thursday, March 12 Update</h3>
<p>Dear McKinney ISD Community,</p>
<p>I want to extend my thanks to our community for the concern and care that you’ve shown during the rapidly changing circumstances surrounding COVID-19. As a district, McKinney ISD remains committed to providing an outstanding education in a safe and secure learning environment. Please know that students are always at the heart of our decisions and we are managing this situation with them and our entire community in mind. As circumstances continue to evolve, we will stay in touch with our community to provide timely and concise information based on the most current guidance from our local, state and federal health authorities.</p>
<p>Due to the March 11, 2020 announcement by the World Health Organization that the outbreak of the new coronavirus has been declared a pandemic, updated announcements by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and information from medical professionals and state and federal health officials, the following action is being taken in an attempt to minimize health and safety risks to the McKinney ISD community.</p>
<p>As a precaution, MISD and several surrounding school districts are extending spring break by one week. <strong>Schools will remain closed for students and staff Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 20 as we assess the situation in our community as travelers return from spring break.</strong> The district will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation prior to reopening school on Monday, March 23, and will communicate across all channels as updated information becomes available. During this extended spring break, district offices will be closed and all district events and competitions that have been scheduled within the district during this timeframe will be considered cancelled until further notice. District travel for student competitions and events outside the district will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>We are taking these steps out of an abundance of caution. Public health officials have not yet made this a requirement for public institutions. Nevertheless, given all that we know, and what we can anticipate based on information from local, state and national agencies, including Collin County Health Services, Texas Health and Human Services, Texas Education Agency and the Centers for Disease Control, we believe this is the most prudent course of action at this time.</p>
<p>Please know that McKinney ISD provides many digital tools to support in-class learning, and our students will have access to these resources. MISD will be communicating our plan for digital learning to our staffs before Monday morning. We will provide information on additional ways to leverage our rich technological resources for continued student support should it become necessary to extend closure beyond next week</p>
<p>Meanwhile, care for yourself, your family and those around you, and continue to adhere to the preventative measures as recommended by public health officials, such as limiting interaction and practicing social distancing. Visit the CDC website for more information.</p>
<p>McKinney ISD will continue to provide the most current and up-to-date information in regards to future closings. We urge you to continue to check our MISD Website and other MISD social media outlets for additional information as it becomes available. This is a rapidly progressing situation which impacts every citizen across the globe. Thank you for your patience and partnership as we work together to deliver a successful learning experience for our students under these unprecedented circumstances.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rick McDaniel<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>
<h3>Thursday, March 5</h3>
<p><strong>Health Update: COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus)</strong></p>
<p>The health and well-being of our students, families and staff are always a top priority in McKinney ISD. Recent news/media coverage of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) has raised questions about the spread of the infection in the United States. We want you to be informed about what we are doing in McKinney ISD.</p>
<p>McKinney ISD Health Services and campus nurses are well prepared. We have protocols and policies in place to ensure students are sent home with fever or when ill, and we have protocols for ensuring they are fever-free before they return to school.</p>
<p>McKinney ISD Health Services also monitors student/staff absences on a daily basis and is in constant contact with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the Collin County Health Department for updates and guidance. McKinney ISD Health Services works closely with facilities and maintenance to ensure proper disinfection and cleaning.</p>
<p>Much is being learned about this newly emerged virus.  Based on the current information, health officials are recommending local communities and schools take the same steps to protect against coronavirus COVID-19 as we take to prevent the spread of everyday illnesses like the common cold or the flu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick. McKinney ISD’s exclusion protocol is consistent with public health guidance. Any student or staff member who is ill with a fever over 100 degrees, or has acute respiratory symptoms, should stay home and remain at home until fever-free for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
<li>Symptoms for COVID-19 often mimic the flu, so we highly recommend getting a flu shot.</li>
<li>We recommend that anyone traveling out of the country be familiar with and follow CDC’s traveler’s health notices. Be aware that additional countries have been added to the list of destinations that have an increased risk of community spread of COVID-19. Current travel notices are available at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will always be responsive and open with communication to parents and staff about any reported or suspected cases, in addition to sharing the following best practices for staying healthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will continue to use our preventative cleaning measures at each campus to thoroughly and comprehensively disinfect. We are deep cleaning high-touch surfaces of schools and facilities.</li>
<li>We will continue to train for and implement good hand-washing practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Updated information from the CDC on Coronavirus in the United States can be found at: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a>. The most recent information about Coronavirus in Texas may be found at: <a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/</a>. Information from the World Health Organization may be found at: <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/</a></p>
<p>McKinney ISD has plans in place, along with trained staff, to respond to a communicable disease outbreak. The decision to close schools is not taken lightly, as it does cause a major disruption to daily life. McKinney ISD will continue to provide updates when there are changes in the current situation or additional steps are needed.</p>
