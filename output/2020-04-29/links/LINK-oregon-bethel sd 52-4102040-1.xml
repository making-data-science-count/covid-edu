<p>Salem, OR—At the direction of Governor Kate Brown, the Oregon Department of Revenue is adjusting requirements of businesses making estimated payments of the Corporate Activity Tax.<br><br>
Beginning immediately, Revenue has revised OAR 150-317-1300, dated April 27, 2020, to reflect a change in the threshold for making estimated tax payments from $5,000 of annual tax liability to $10,000 of annual tax liability for the first year of the tax. This means businesses that will owe less than $10,000 are not required to make quarterly estimated tax payments during 2020.<br><br>
Revenue also won’t assess penalties for underestimated quarterly payments or for not making a quarterly payment, if businesses don’t have the financial ability to make the estimated payment.<br><br>
If businesses know they’ll owe $10,000 or more in annual Corporate Activity Tax in 2020 and can pay, they should make estimated quarterly payments and comply with the law to the fullest extent possible.<br><br>
The Department of Revenue will honor a business taxpayer’s good-faith efforts to comply and not assess penalties if they document their efforts to comply, including how COVID-19 has impacted their business.<br><br>
If businesses have been impacted by COVID-19 and are finding it difficult to calculate or pay an estimated quarterly payment, they should keep documentation showing:<br>
• Their inability to pay a quarterly payment because of insufficient funds due to COVID-19.<br>
• Their inability to reasonably calculate a quarterly payment or annual tax liability due to their business being impacted by COVID-19.<br>
• That the taxpayer is unclear at this time whether the business will owe Corporate Activity Tax in April 2020 due to COVID-19 impacts, after taking into consideration exclusions and subtractions in the law.<br><br>
Businesses uncertain about their economic future due to the COVID-19 crisis, or those that have been closed during this crisis and have no ability to determine that they will owe a tax this year, won’t be penalized.<br><br>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  - April 29, 2020<strong> </strong></p>

<p>(Douglas County, Ore.)  The Douglas County Tax Collection Office would like to remind residents that the deadline for the third trimester payment for the 2019/2020 Property Tax year is fast approaching.  The third trimester payment must be received or postmarked no later than <strong>May 15, 2020</strong>, to avoid interest and penalties. At this time, the State of Oregon has not extended the property tax due dates, and the County does not have the authority to extend the due dates.  The Tax Office plans to mail statements starting today, April 29.</p>

<p><strong>Douglas County Courthouse now open:</strong></p>

<p>As a reminder the Douglas County Board of Commissioners officially reopened the Douglas County Courthouse.  <strong>The reopening at the Douglas County Courthouse incorporates very strict social distancing procedures for county employees, as well as for the visiting public.</strong>  Your Commissioners continue to urge citizens to follow the Governor’s Executive Orders to ‘Stay Home, Save Lives.’  </p>

<p><strong>Payments can be made via U.S. Mail:</strong></p>

<p>You can mail your tax payment using the provided payment envelope and appropriate postage.  Please note that due to recent changes with the US Postal Service, mail is often transported out-of-town for processing and postmark.  Be sure to mail your tax payment early or take your payment envelope into the Post Office to receive an official “hand stamped local postmark”, to avoid late penalties.</p>

<p><strong>Payments can be made online at:  </strong></p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133825');">County mowers are hitting the road in early hours and need clear rights-of-way</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.lanecountyor.gov" target="_blank">Lane Co. Government</a> - 04/29/20 8:00 AM</span><div id="news133825" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>Drivers on rural County-maintained roads will see mowers clearing the road rights-of-way of grass and brush beginning as early as 4:00 a.m. in order to reduce potential fire danger as we progress into fire season. In the rural areas, the road right-of-way is typically from the pavement to the fence or private property line (anywhere the maintenance vehicles would drive). In the unincorporated parts of Eugene or Springfield, the right-of-way is the planting area between the sidewalk and curb.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Property owners can help prepare by ensuring they have not placed anything in the mowers’ path in the road right-of-way.</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Signs. </strong>No political signs, business signs or other types of signs belong in the road right-of-way. Signs will be removed. Signs placed near a rural road should be placed on private property behind any utility facilities (poles, closures, etc.) or sidewalks.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Rocks.</strong> Rocks over 3 inches in diameter and other fixed objects must be removed from the right-of-way.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Fencing.</strong> Derelict fencing can be both a hazard and a high-cost obstacle for mowers. Fencing that has fallen into the road right-of-way can become entangled in the equipment, or can make it impossible to clear the affected area of grass and brush.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Ornamental vegetation or other plantings. </strong>Plants in the right-of-way, especially those that grow large and aggressively, will be removed. Plants in the right-of-way will be mown to the lowest level practical in order to provide the longest-lasting effect.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p>“Mowing is an important part of how we reduce fire danger and make sure that drivers have clear lines of sight on County roads,” said Chad McBride, Lane County vegetation supervisor. “Proactive maintenance makes the roads safer for everyone.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>By keeping items out of the right-of-way, residents can avoid unnecessary expense and hassle, save taxpayer money by saving Public Works personnel from having to remove signs and other items, and help protect your neighbors and visitors from accidents.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Drivers are allowed to pass the mowers on the left when it is safe to do so, but must remember that oncoming traffic takes precedence.</p>

</div>
<p>SALEM, Ore. – The National Fire Protection Association’s Community Wildfire Preparedness Day is Saturday, May 2. This day is a call to action inviting people of all ages to plan and participate in wildfire preparedness and risk-reduction activities to make their properties and community safer.</p>

<p>This year, a dozen Oregon communities competed nationally and were each awarded $500 to assist with wildfire prevention projects for Wildfire Community Preparedness Day.  Although some activities may be slightly altered to adjust for physical distancing due to COVID-19, there is still much work that can be done.</p>

<p>For the seventh consecutive year, State Farm Insurance is providing financial support to these 12 Oregon communities, which received a total of 16 awards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Azalea</li>
     <li>Baker City</li>
     <li>Bend (3)</li>
     <li>Corvallis</li>
     <li>Eugene (2)</li>
     <li>Gold Hill</li>
     <li>Lapine</li>
     <li>Merlin</li>
     <li>Ontario</li>
     <li>Roseburg</li>
     <li>Sisters (2)</li>
     <li>Springfield</li>
</ul>
<p>They join 134 other communities nationwide in reducing their wildfire risk and creating a safer future.</p>

<p>“Covid-19 has changed community dynamics and created more time at home for many Oregon residents, time that can be used to clear brush from around homes and other preparedness activities,” said National Fire Plan Coordinator Jenna Trentadue with the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF).  “Even with physical distancing requirements in place, we can all still do our part on May 2 to be more prepared for wildfire.”</p>

<p><strong>What the experts say:</strong></p>

<p>“Cleaning up around the home is an excellent way to start thinking about <strong>fire prevention</strong> this summer,” says ODF’s Fire Prevention Coordinator Tom Fields. “Whether it’s disposing of the yard waste created through cleanup, planning your summer camping trip, or using outdoor power equipment, be sure and exercise caution with fire or spark emitting activities.”</p>

<p>In light of an expected worsening of the state’s drought this summer, Keep Oregon Green (KOG), the Office of the State Fire Marshal, and Oregon Department of Forestry are working hard to spread an important prevention message about defensible space:</p>

<p>Kristin Babbs, KOG President and CEO, says that “Our main concern this summer is people. They are responsible for over 70% of Oregon’s wildfires. The good news is, with good <strong>defensible space</strong>, fire does not have to consume everything in its path. If a fire accidently starts on your property, it will be unlikely to spread to neighboring houses if there’s no fuel to carry the flame. The more defensible space a homeowner creates before fire season, the better a home’s chances of surviving a wildfire in the heat of summer.”</p>

<p>Claire McGrew, Assistant Chief Deputy at the Office of State Fire Marshal adds, “Wildfire safety starts with you. During a time when we are experiencing social distancing, this presents a good opportunity to prepare our homes, families and communities for wildfires by starting on our own property. “</p>

<p>Projects for Wildfire Preparedness Day can range from a few hours up to an entire day.  Below are some examples of things you can do to reduce the risk of home and property becoming fuel for a wildfire:</p>

<p>• Remove debris and dry leaves 3 to 5 feet from of a home’s foundation, and up to 30 ft. if possible.</p>

<p>• Keep your roof and gutters free of downed tree limbs, broken branches and leaves.</p>

<p>• Distribute wildfire safety information via email or website, or order free Firewise and emergency preparedness materials from the Firewise catalog or from <a href="https://www.ready.gov/plan."></a><a href="https://www.ready.gov/plan." rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://www.ready.gov/plan.</a></p>

<p>• Join forces with neighbors and pool your resources to pay for a chipper service or large debris bin to remove slash.</p>

<p>• Make a map of the community and indicate where elderly and people with animals are located, who may     need more help during an emergency, and assign community members to assist them.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 27, 2020, at 3:07 p.m., Albany Police received a call from a distraught female indicating she was walking from house to house attempting to find a Sheriff in her neighborhood to kill.  The incident occurred in the area of SW Marten Avenue and Chinook.  The female was identified as 23-year old Micayla N. Martin of Albany.  Martin told police dispatch that she was in front of a Sheriff Deputy’s house and was going to kill him. </p>

<p>Albany Police confirmed Martin was in front of a Linn County Deputy’s residence armed with a knife and wanted police to shoot her.  Albany Police responded to the area and located Martin standing on the sidewalk holding a knife.  Albany Police Officer Koddie Lowery spoke with Martin from a safe distance and attempted to get her help.  Martin refused assistance and disregarded directives to drop the knife she was holding.</p>

<p>Martin charged Officer Kyle Libra from one-half block away while armed with the knife.  Officers repeatedly ordered Martin to stop but she refused, continuing to run at Officer Libra with a knife.  Officer Libra shot Martin with a less-lethal 40 mm impact weapon which caused Martin to stumble and fall within 10 feet of another Officer.  Martin attempted to get up with the knife and was then tased by other officers, allowing officers to secure the knife and take custody of Martin.</p>

<p><br>
During the incident, officers maintained a safe distance while communicating with Martin.  This was an extraordinary event where our officers used good judgement and tactics to avoid using lethal force in this situation.     </p>

<p>Martin was taken to Samaritan Albany General Hospital for treatment of minor injuries relating to the incident and a mental health evaluation.</p>

<p>On April 28, 2020 Martin was taken to the Linn County Jail on the following charges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attempted Murder</li>
     <li>Attempted Assault in the First Degree (3 counts)</li>
     <li>Menacing (5 counts)</li>
     <li>Attempted Assault on a Peace Officer (3 counts)</li>
     <li>Unlawful Use of a Weapon  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 28, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)  </strong>The Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, your Douglas County Commissioners and our local health professionals want to remind you that it is important to not delay needed health care and doctor visits.  While many of us are worried about the COVID-19 crisis, other medical conditions such as appendicitis and heart attacks still happen, and they can be deadly if not treated appropriately.  If you have a serious health condition, do not hesitate to seek care at a hospital or urgent care.</p>

<ul>
<li>Emergency care can and should still be sought – this includes, but is not limited to, possible strokes, heart attacks, bleeding that won’t stop, broken bones, etc.</li>
     <li>If you have an emergency, do not hesitate to dial 9-1-1 for an ambulance response.</li>
     <li>If you have medical concerns or questions, do not ignore them, contact your healthcare provider. If you don’t have a healthcare provider, contact an urgent care clinic or hospital.</li>
     <li>Some routine services such as preventive screening procedures were delayed. Call to see about rescheduling now that some elective procedures can resume. </li>
     <li>Some routine services can be provided by telehealth, so long as this type of visit is offered by your health care provider. Ask your health care provider about your appointments and if the telehealth option is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please don’t delay needed care, doctor visits etc.  Soon our hospitals and clinics will start to schedule and perform some previously scheduled procedures.  Our local hospitals, as well as medical clinics and urgent care clinics have instituted additional safety and screening procedures to make access to needed care as safe and convenient as possible for people during this pandemic. </p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 28, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  For the twelfth day in a row, the total number of positives in Douglas County remains at twenty-three.  Of the twenty-three, fifteen have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 983 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Two of the twenty-three people that have tested positive are still hospitalized in different hospitals.  Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Fifteen of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Get Tested</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is a drive through clinic today, Tuesday, April 28, 2020, in Roseburg.</strong>  If you are having symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, diarrhea, sore throat or decreased sense of smell and taste, talk to your health care provider about being tested for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Given the growing availability of commercial labs and the improving availability of testing supplies and PPE DPHN has revised their guidelines to providers on testing. DPHN has sent out communications to the local health care community alerting them of the increased availability of testing for their patients.  DPHN also announced Wednesday that Quest labs is now offering the IgG antibody test for COVID-19 locally. Both tests must be ordered by a health care provider and currently, testing without a provider order is not yet available.  </p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 370 people tested in the drive through clinics alone, additional testing continues in hospitals, urgent cares and clinics simultaneously.  The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Oregon COVID-19 Case Update</strong></p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority reports new cases once a day on its website at <a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.  The Oregon Health Authority is also releasing the daily situation status report, which is produced jointly with Oregon Office of Emergency Management. It details the overall picture of the COVID-19 outbreak within the state and the response across government agencies. <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/SLdyToaAQ2i1P0EsaL7t_Oregon-COVID-19-SitStat-03-26-2020-FINAL.pdf">Read more here about the daily situation status report</a>.</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk38616481"><strong>DCCRT Partner Spotlight: Mercy Medical Center</strong></a></p>

<p>Mercy Medical Center has been at the core of Douglas County’s COVID-19 response from the beginning, with Mercy officials and partners working hard to ensure the hospital is prepared to manage a surge of coronavirus patients, should that need arise.  The hospital has set up a 36-bed COVID-19 unit, but has not yet used it, it as the number of local patients requiring hospitalization has remained very low. Collaborating with Douglas Public Health Network (DPHN), Douglas County Commissioners and other partners through the Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team (DCCRT) has enabled Mercy to keep the community informed while focusing on its core mission of providing high-quality care to its patients. Mercy representation on the DCCRT includes CEO Kelly Morgan and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jason Gray. Even before joining DCCRT, Mercy began having internal meetings about COVID-19 in early February.</p>

<p>At the time, there were projections that Mercy would need up to 150 medical beds and 38 critical care beds, so the hospital began working to set up its COVID unit.  Early on in the COVID-19 crisis, Mercy also started screening all hospital visitors. The number of visitors per patient was restricted, and later no visitors were allowed at all, with few exceptions. Staff are also screened on a daily basis, and the hospital has implemented a universal masking policy, following CDC recommendations.   There was a big need for personal protective equipment (PPE), which is in short supply nationwide. With already-established strong community ties, Mercy Foundation launched an extensive outreach campaign seeking donations of masks, gloves, gowns and other equipment – and people stepped up in a big way, from individuals to businesses and government agencies.</p>

<p>“Our community has just been amazingly responsive in the way it always is here,” Mercy Communications Director Kathleen Nickel said. “People in Douglas County are so supportive and generous.”  </p>

<p>Mercy has also worked with locally companies to create a local supply chain of reusable PPE. For instance, Oregon Serigraphics and their team of “Sewing Warriors” have made thousands of homemade masks; FCC Commercial Furniture has sourced specialized fabric and is cutting fabric for 500 reusable gowns; and 15 local seamstresses and tailors have stepped up to sew the gowns. Additionally, the Roseburg VA has begun sanitizing Mercy’s N95 masks using an ultraviolet-light disinfecting process, allowing each mask to be used up to four times, which expands the PPE supply.  With the Governor lifting restrictions on non-urgent medical procedures and elective surgeries starting this Friday, Mercy is planning to gradually resume procedures and surgeries, making sure the hospital maintains an adequate PPE supply and the capacity to care for any additional COVID-19 patients.  “Through a partnership with the Cow Creek Tribe and with Providence, we can prescreen everyone who is set for surgery to ensure that they have a negative COVID test prior to surgery,” Nickel said.</p>

<p>This isn’t Mercy’s first pandemic; the Sisters of Mercy opened the hospital in 1909, nearly a decade before the Spanish Flu hit. Mercy was Roseburg’s first hospital, located at the corner of Harvard Avenue and Madrone Street, with 25 beds. Mercy is one of two hospitals in the county with an Emergency Department; the other is Lower Umpqua Hospital in Reedsport.</p>

<p>Residents of Douglas County have helped ensure that the local health care system could handle a surge in COVID patients by following the Governor’s #stayhomesavelives efforts, and now it’s time to take care of themselves.  Nickel wants residents to be aware that Mercy has put in place a number of safeguards to ensure patient and staff safety, and that the organization is ready to serve our community’s health care needs.</p>

<p>“From our outpatient services, lab, imaging, heart center and therapy to the ED and inpatient care units, we want the community to know that we are safe and ready to care for them.  Patients who have had to delay needed care due to COVID, should speak with their health provider about rescheduling exams and surgeries.”</p>

<p><strong>Douglas County Parks and RV Parks Will Reopen May 1</strong></p>

<p>The Douglas County Board of Commissioners announced today that effective May 1, 2020, Douglas County operated Parks and RV Parks will reopen to the public on a limited basis.  Despite the reopening, they continue to encourage residents to stay home and follow the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf">Governor’s Executive Order #20-12</a>, ‘Stay Home, Save Lives.’  However, we do understand the role our outdoor recreational sites provide in keeping our residents mentally and physically healthy.  Our parks do have the capacity to allow you to get out and rejuvenate, while remaining dispersed.  <strong>But, be prepared, if the use restrictions are not followed, it could lead to the re-closing of our park facilities.</strong>  <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/coronavirus/press_releases/04-28-20%20Douglas%20County%20Parks%20and%20RV%20Parks%20Will%20Reopen%20May%201%20R.pdf">Click here for the complete story and limited use guidelines.</a>   Reminder: A good portion of your safety relies on you, since any public facility is only as clean as the last person who touched it.  Please use all our facilities with caution and at your own risk.  And make sure you are following the physical distancing and limited use guidelines, so we can continue to keep our parks open.   </p>

<p><strong>What Would Restaurants Reopening Look Like?</strong></p>

<p>There was an Oregon Restaurant Sector sub-committee last week to assess what a Phase One reopening would look like for food service establishments.  As a result of that meeting, <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/2020/04_april/04-28-20%20Draft%20Guidelines.pdf">several draft public health recommendations were issued</a>.  At this time, there is no clear timeline for a Phase One reopening, and the decision to reopen ultimately is in the hands of the Oregon Governor.  The state is still working on:</p>

<p><strong>Gating criteria: </strong>Symptoms – declining numbers; cases – declining numbers and Hospital capacity –regular             procedures and adequate testing.</p>

<p><strong>Plans around core state preparedness: </strong>robust testing and contact tracing; healthcare system capacity, including PPE and surge capacity and plans for health and safety.</p>

<p>We know that there is still a sense of uncertainty and fear amongst our workforce as we move forward. We are continuing to work on supporting the supply chain for PPE/face covering/gloves so workers can stay safe.</p>

<p><strong>Stores Given OK to Decline Bottle Returns Through May 31</strong></p>

<p>Many grocery stores have chosen to temporarily stop accepting bottle returns during the COVID-19 crisis to help protect the health and safety of their staff and customers. Stores have permission from the state to decline returns, and the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) has just extended this permission until May 31. “The temporary period of non-enforcement began March 15, at a time when grocers and supermarkets were overwhelmed with an unprecedented volume of customers,” the OLCC said in a press release. The surge in shoppers sparked concern about stores having sufficient staffing and cleaning supplies to properly disinfect items and maintain appropriate social distancing. If your local store is not accepting beverage-container returns, local officials recommend keeping your containers until stores resume accepting them. Eligible beverage containers will still be worth 10 cents each when bottle drops reopen. The Roseburg BottleDrop Redemption Center at 740 NE Garden Valley Blvd. currently remains open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk38272665"></a><a name="_Hlk38968745"><strong>How to Check the Status of your Stimulus Check</strong></a></p>

<p>Many people have already had their federal Economic Impact Payments deposited into their bank accounts. These direct deposits have been made for <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center">eligible</a> 2019 or 2018 federal tax return filers who received their past refunds through direct deposit.  If you didn’t receive a refund for 2019 or 2018 via direct deposit, you can visit the IRS’s <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment">“Get My Payment”</a> page, which allows you to provide your banking information on your return so you can receive payments right away. You can also use this site to track the status of your payment. The first wave of paper checks has already been mailed.</p>

<p>For those who didn’t file a federal return in 2018 or 2019, you can visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">“Non-Filers”</a> IRS site and get set up for direct deposit. This site also contains information on eligibility for stimulus payments.</p>

<p><strong>Declining Social Invitations in the Time of COVID-19</strong></p>

<p>Despite official guidance to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19, you may encounter a friend or family member who invites you to hang out in person. It can be awkward to decline such invites; we want our loved ones to know we care about them, but we also want to protect ourselves, our friends and the community at large. Don’t feel bad for saying “no”; you are doing the right thing by setting boundaries in order to protect others’ health and your own.  Here are some tips from Oregon Health Authority on how to say “no” to a social invitation:</p>

<ul>
<li>“I believe it’s important to stay home and keep the virus from spreading.”</li>
     <li>“In our household, we’re keeping a healthy distance from others to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.”</li>
     <li>“I look forward to seeing you when we can all safely get together again.”</li>
     <li>“We would love to visit with you online or over the phone.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daily Tips: Outreach Tuesday</strong></p>

<p>Today is a good day to check on a friend or family member you think may be struggling or feeling isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have kids at home, or a busy household, you may be craving quiet time – but for others, the down time can be lonely. Give your loved one a call and see how they’re doing. Send them a text message, or email them a link to a funny video. Chat with them by video and get them to smile. Even small amounts of contact can brighten someone’s day. An added bonus: Focusing on making others feel good helps reduce your own stress!</p>

<p><strong>Give Blood and Help Your Community</strong></p>

<p>Blood supplies are seriously low and leaving home to donate blood is considered a lifesaving need.  If you are healthy and feeling well, then giving blood is a safe and great way to help your community. The Red Cross has implemented sanitizing and social distancing policies to ensure you’re safe while making a lifesaving donation. Anyone interested in donating must make an appointment by visiting <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org"></a><a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.redcrossblood.org</a> or calling (800) 733-2767. </p>

<p>(Salem) – Oregon OSHA has adopted a temporary rule to increase protections for workers against the spread of coronavirus in employer-provided housing and in labor-intensive farm operations.</p>

<p>The rule, which takes effect May 11, 2020,  addresses the COVID-19 emergency in such housing and operations by strengthening requirements in three areas: field sanitation, labor housing, and transportation.</p>

<p>“This temporary rule reflects the need to rapidly address COVID-19 in operations where the nature of the work – and the spaces in which that work occurs – raise particularly daunting challenges,” said Michael Wood, administrator for Oregon OSHA. “At the same time, it accounts for the feasibility issues employers may encounter as they step up to fulfill these new responsibilities.”</p>

<p>The rule, which will remain in effect until no later than Oct. 28, 2020, encompasses multiple provisions.</p>

<p>In field sanitation, for example, it requires employers to appoint one or more social distancing officers to ensure at least six feet of separation during work activities, breaks, and meal periods. The same applies for housing operations to ensure at least six feet of distance between unrelated people.</p>

<p>In transportation, for example, the rule requires at least three feet of social distancing during travel in employer-provided vehicles, as well as facial coverings worn by passengers and by the driver in employer-provided vehicles.</p>

<p>The rule stems from a March 20 request by the Oregon Law Center and Dr. Eva Galvez of Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center to immediately adopt requirements related to such housing and operations. Instead, Oregon OSHA treated the request as a petition for rulemaking and put it on a faster evaluation track than normal. That track included time for public comments, the deadline for which was April 13. Oregon OSHA reviewed more than 120.</p>

<p>As the division moves forward with a temporary rule aimed at reducing worker exposure to COVID-19, it expects to continue discussing broader issues involving agriculture labor housing. Just as it has for more than a year, the division’s Agriculture Labor Housing Committee – encompassing labor, employer, grower, and government representatives – will continue that discussion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the temporary rule’s requirements – the effective dates of which are staggered in certain cases – are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Field sanitation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Employers must appoint one or more social distancing officers and implement work practices to ensure at least six feet of separation during work activities, breaks, and meal periods.</li>
     <li>Effective June 1, 2020, employers must increase toilet availability by decreasing the ratio of both toilet and handwashing facilities in the field from the current one per 20 workers to one per 10 workers. Employers who can demonstrate that market availability prevents immediate compliance must provide as many toilet and handwashing facilities as possible until the ratio is achieved.</li>
     <li>In addition to the existing requirement that toilet and handwashing facilities be within a quarter mile of workers, toilets must be located at the entrance or exit to the field or in a completely harvested area, whichever is closer.</li>
     <li>Toilets and handwashing facilities must be sanitized at least three times daily.</li>
     <li>Field sanitation notice and training requirements are revised to include prevention of COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Labor housing</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In relation to registered agricultural labor housing operations,  additional guidance is provided on registration of temporary housing and the use of existing hotel or motel facilities.</li>
     <li>Employers must appoint one or more social distancing officers and implement housing operations to ensure at least six feet of separation between unrelated individuals.</li>
     <li>Effective June 1, 2020, employers must provide additional toilets by reducing the ratio from one toilet for every 15 workers to one toilet for every 10 workers. Employers who can demonstrate that market availability prevents immediate compliance must provide as many toilet facilities as possible until the ratio is achieved.</li>
     <li> Use of bunk beds by unrelated individuals is prohibited.</li>
     <li>Square footage requirements do not change. However,  the separation of beds by at least six feet or by an impermeable barrier is required.</li>
     <li>Common use toilets and handwashing facilities, and other high contact common use items must be sanitized at least two times daily.  Employers must also  provide appropriate cleaning materials to enable occupants to keep private living areas clean and sanitary.</li>
     <li>As required under existing Oregon Health Authority rules, COVID-19 must be reported immediately, day or night.</li>
     <li>In terms of  the isolation of COVID-19 confirmed or suspected cases, employers must follow certain requirements, including ensuring that  food and water is provided to those in isolation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> At least three feet of social distancing must be maintained during travel in employer-provided vehicles.</li>
     <li> Facial coverings must be worn by passengers and by the driver in employer-provided vehicles.</li>
     <li> High-contact areas in employer-provided vehicles must be sanitized before each trip or at least two times daily if in continuous use.</li>
     <li> Employers must  provide training to employees about ensuring appropriate social distancing when in their personal vehicles.</li>
</ul>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133837');">Marine Board Urges Boaters: Be Safe, Practice Physical Distancing</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.boatoregon.com" target="_blank">Oregon Marine Board</a> - 04/28/20 2:30 PM</span><div id="news133837" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>As boaters gear up to hit the water, they need to keep in mind tips for being safe on cold water as well as their responsibility for staying close to home and practicing physical distancing under Governor Brown’s “Stay Home, Save Lives” executive order.</p>

<p>“For many of us, we have a natural urge to get outside this time of year -the water calls to us,” said Larry Warren, Director for the Marine Board. “We aim to consistently remind people about ways they can stay safe while they’re on the water and in light of COVID-19, we also ask this year that you take additional steps to protect yourself, your family, and the people around you. Use your good judgment and if you venture out to go boating, be fluid and adaptable to rapidly changing situations.”</p>

<p><strong>Cold-water safety</strong><br>
The waterways this time of year are dangerously cold. Falls into the water can quickly turn tragic. Water temperatures are hovering in the 50-degree range and falling overboard will trigger cold-water shock. Numbness will set in quickly, and swimming or calling for help will be difficult.  A gasp reflex will happen uncontrollably and draw water into your lungs. Even strong swimmers may drown within minutes.</p>

<p>“The best way to prevent that from happening is to wear a life jacket – actually wear it, not just have it in the boat,” said Ashley Massey, Public Information Officer for the Marine Board. “Make it a habit like putting on your seatbelt. The reality is there isn’t time to put one on in an emergency.”</p>

<p>The cold-water is another reason to boat with others. This year, people should head out only with members of their immediate household and let others on shore know where they’re going and when they plan to return. A <strong><a href="https://www.oregon.gov/osmb/forms-library/Documents/Education/FloatPlanOSMB2015.pdf">printable float plan</a> </strong>is perfect for documenting all that rescue personnel would need in case of an emergency. Help first responders and marine law enforcement by <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/osmb/boater-info/Pages/Safety-and-Education.aspx"><strong>playing it safe</strong></a><strong> </strong>and wearing your life jacket, having the appropriate safety equipment, and communication tools/devices.    </p>

<p><strong>Boating during COVID-19</strong><br>
When hitting the water, know the Marine Board’s <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/osmb/info/Pages/COVID-19.aspx"><strong>recreational boating guidelines</strong> </a>and practice the following to protect yourselves and others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explore waterways close to home. Leave from your home to the boat and back so that you don't have unnecessary contact with others. </li>
     <li>Be self-sufficient. Carry needed supplies with you to minimize non-essential stops.</li>
     <li>Take time in advance to see if a boat ramp is open. Some city and county facilities are allowing boats to launch. Visit the Marine Board's <a href="https://www.boatoregon.com/map"><strong>interactive Boat Oregon Map</strong></a> to find contact information to a facility near you. Keep in mind that even though a ramp may be open to launching, the restrooms may not be. Many pumpout/dump stations are operational where facilities are open.</li>
     <li>Follow the Governor's order on physical distancing. Space out (6-feet or more) and take turns launching and retrieving. Be patient. </li>
     <li>Maintain a safe distance at a fuel dock or loading up at a marina. After touching a marine gate, fuel pump or other objects frequently touched by others, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer. </li>
     <li>Families living in the same household can continue to boat as a family.  </li>
     <li>The CDC is now recommending that everyone wear a <a href="https://youtu.be/tPx1yqvJgf4"><strong>face-covering</strong></a><strong> </strong>in public. Protect yourself and your family <em>before and after your time on the water</em> by wearing a face covering.</li>
     <li>Expect some facilities to have reduced launch lanes or alternate-space parking closures following social distancing orders to prevent crowding. If a facility has a lot of patrons and if physical distancing can't be maintained, try again another day.</li>
     <li>Paddlers out on the water: it's good to stick together, but unless you're all under the same household, maintain a minimum of 6-feet physical distance from others. </li>
     <li>Marine law enforcement officers are actively patrolling looking for compliance with existing laws. Follow all statewide and local area rules for equipment, operation, and proximity. Officers are educating the public about physical distancing measures but have the authority to write citations under the Governor's order.</li>
     <li>Stay home if you are sick.</li>
     <li>Wash hands frequently.</li>
     <li>Need to title, register, or renew your motorboat registration? Need a Waterway Access Permit or Boating Safety Education Card? Visit our <a href="https://www.boatoregon.com/store"><strong>BoatOregon Store</strong></a><strong> </strong>online. <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/osmb/boater-info/Pages/Internet-Courses.aspx"><strong>Education courses</strong></a><strong> </strong>are also available online.</li>
</ul>
<p>###</p>

<p><em>The Marine Board is directly funded by boaters in the form of registration, title, and permit fees, as well as through marine fuel taxes<strong>. No lottery, general fund tax dollars,</strong></em> <em><strong>or local facility parking fees </strong></em><em>support the agency or its programs.

<p>Salem, Oregon<strong> –</strong> sidony o’neal, a writer and artist living in Portland, is the 2020 recipient of the Oregon Arts Commission’s honorary Joan Shipley Award. o’neal is one of a group of nine Oregon artists selected for the Arts Commission’s 2020 Individual Artist Fellowships. The 2020 fellowships support artists working in the visual arts; performing artists are awarded in alternating years.</p>

<p>The Joan Shipley Award is named for Oregon arts leader Joan Shipley, who passed away in 2011. Shipley was a collector, philanthropist and supporter of many arts and humanities organizations. In 2005, she and her husband John received an Oregon Governor’s Arts Award. Many in the arts community also counted her as a mentor and friend.</p>

<p>The Arts Commission’s Fellowship program is available to more than 20,000 artists who call Oregon home. Fellows are recommended by a panel of Oregon arts professionals who consider artists of outstanding talent, demonstrated ability and commitment to the creation of new work(s). The Arts Commission reviews and acts on the panel’s recommendations.</p>

<p>The following visual artists were awarded 2020 fellowships: Julia Bradshaw, Corvallis; Melanie Flood, Portland; Erik Geschke, Portland; Colin Ives, Eugene; ruben garcia marrufo, Portland; sidony o'neal (Shipley Fellow), Portland; Garrett Sluski, Portland; Maya Vivas, Portland; and Sarah Wertzberger, Portland.</p>

<p>Brief biographies follow. Photos of artist work are available on request.</p>

<p><em><strong>Julia Bradshaw, Corvallis</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Born in Manchester, England, and having lived for nearly a decade in Munich, Germany, Julia Bradshaw brings a heightened interest in intercultural modes of language to her research-based practice. Currently, history and technology of photography, scientific language and astrophotography inform her work, which results in new fictive imagery. </em></p>

<p><em>Bradshaw’s videos and photography have been exhibited in the United States, The Netherlands, Guatemala and Germany. Her artist book “Flying” is in the Getty Research Collection. She is an Associate Professor in the School of Arts and Communication at Oregon State University.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Melanie Flood, Portland</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Melanie Flood’s arrangements use tools of still-life and commercial photography, while examining modern femininity and the female body. “Though the chosen materials are often cheap and flimsy relics of pop culture and mass consumerism (pantyhose, ThighMaster, toilet brush holder),” writes Fourteen30 Contemporary, “they are easily transformed into sensuous, refined reflections of the feminine experience through perfect lighting and the simple act of being photographed.“ </em></p>

<p><em>Flood holds a BFA in Photography from the School of Visual Arts in New York and an MFA in Contemporary Art Practice from Portland State University. She directs Melanie Flood Projects, which began as an artists’ salon located in her Brooklyn residence. In 2014, the gallery relaunched in downtown Portland. She is represented by Fourteen30 Contemporary.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Erik Geschke, Portland</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Erik Geschke is a mixed-media artist who has exhibited at venues including the Hammer Museum of Art in Los Angeles, ZieherSmith Gallery and Knoedler &amp; Company in New York, The Navy Pier in Chicago, Vox Populi in Philadelphia, Tacoma Art Museum, Pacific Northwest College of Art and Disjecta Contemporary Art Center in Portland and FIAC Contemporary Art Fair in Paris, France. </em></p>

<p><em>Geschke has received awards, grants and fellowships from the Seattle Art Museum (Betty Bowen Special Recognition Award); Seattle Arts Commission (Seattle Artists Award); Oregon Arts Commission (Individual Artists Fellowship and Career Opportunity Grant); and the Regional Arts and Culture Council, among others. He received his MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art's Rinehart School of Sculpture in 2001, attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 1996, and received a BFA from Cornish College of the Arts in 1993. He is currently an Associate Professor of Art and coordinator of the sculpture area at Portland State University.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Colin Ives, Eugene</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Colin Ives’ media projects increasingly address ecological issues, in regard to technological consumption as well as our sense of place in the natural world. His project “Nocturne” was chosen for the International Symposium of Electronic Art 2006, and later exhibited at the Microwave International New Media festival in Hong Kong (2008). The project focuses specifically on the nocturnal lives of opossums, mice and kit foxes, animals that have found successful niches in sub/urban landscapes. The project asked viewers to re-envision urban spaces in terms of animal habitat, reconsidering what we think of as nature and wilderness. </em></p>

<p><em>Current projects include an event-based work addressing Salmon habitat in Oregon rivers; a robotic video camera project addressing location/dislocation and our constructed sense of place in the landscape; and a project that focuses on the world of ants. Ives holds an MFA and MA from University of Iowa and BA from Cornell College. Ives was recently included in the Portland2019 Biennial.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>rubén garcía marrufo, Portland </strong></em></p>

<p><em>rubén garcía marrufo is a Mexican filmmaker and artist. Their work focuses on borders and their aftermaths and bilinguality—work that finds its place between fiction and documentary forms with narratives that are rooted in hearsay and multiple languages. They have produced both feature-length, short and experimental films that have been exhibited in Mexico and the US, including work presented at Artists Space, abcontemporary, Kunstverein, Escritorio de Procesos, Echo Park Film Center and Mexicali Rose. marrufo was recently included in the Portland2019 Biennial, and has received grants from PICA’s Precipice Fund and the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council. </em></p>

<p><em><strong>sidony o'neal, Portland</strong></em></p>

<p><em>sidony o'neal is a writer and artist. In addition to solo work, they have performed as a member of performance projects DEAD THOROUGHBRED and DELICTO. o'neal has received recent exhibitions at Fourteen30 Contemporary and Portland Pataphysical Society. Their writing has appeared or is forthcoming in Passages North, BATHHOUSE, SPOOK magazine, FUTURE CONCRETE, Women &amp; Performance, and VARVVARV. They are the translator of “Prognosis: Descarga Poetica Decolonial” (Quilomboarte 2014) and author of “f a c e b o w l” (THE MINI CHAPBOOK PRESS 2013). o'neal has held a Literary In(ter)ventions residency at the Banff Centre, Canada, a Creative Exchange Lab Residency with PICA, a residency at Arteles Center, Finland and artist in residence in the Synth Library at S1 gallery, Portland. They </em>are a co-recipient of two PICA Precipice Fund grants.</p>

<p><em><strong>Kaj-anne Pepper, Portland</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Kaj-anne Pepper is a multidisciplinary artist working in performance, video, drag, installation, theatre and dance. Kaj-anne is alternately known as their celebrated drag persona “Pepper Pepper.” Pepper is a humorous and thoughtful gender-bending emcee, educator and entertainer. Through both a fine arts practice and a career in entertainment Pepper explores vulnerability, artifice, and identity. </em></p>

<p><em>Pepper has received recent residencies at The Macdowell Colony, Playa Summer Lake, Monson Arts Center, Caldera Arts, Space Gallery in Maine, Signal Fire, The Lucky Penny Workroom in Atlanta, Pelican Bomb in New Orleans, New Expressive Works Residency, CON/VERGE at PonderosaTanz and PICA's Creative Exchange Lab.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Maya Vivas, Portland</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Maya Vivas is a multidisciplinary artist working in a variety of mediums such as ceramic, performance, painting, social practice and installation. Vivas has exhibited work, spoken on panels, and hosted workshops throughout the United States including venues and institutions such as PICA, The National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts, Luisiana State University and Yale. Vivas is also co-founder of Ori Gallery, whose mission is to redefine "the white cube" through amplifying the voices of Queer and Trans Artists of color, community organizing and mobilization through the arts.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Sarah Wertzberger, Portland</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Sarah Wertzberger is an artist and designer with a multidisciplinary studio practice, working primarily across mediums of weaving, ceramics, and painting. Her weaving practice spans hand, industrial, and digital weaving. Her work touches upon the ideas of play, color interaction, and the tensions that exist at the intersections of art, design, craft, technology, and DIY. Her making processes are playful and provisional, allowing for a responsive way of working that embraces intuition, allowing the process of making itself to steer outcomes. Wertzberger holds an MFA in Textiles from Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, Rhode Island, and a BFA in Painting from Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland. She is represented by Holding Contemporary, Portland. </em></p>

In 2003, the Oregon legislature moved the operations of the Oregon Cultural Trust to the Arts Commission, streamlining operations and making use of the Commission’s expertise in grantmaking, arts and cultural information and community cultural development. </p>

<p>The Arts Commission is supported with general funds appropriated by the Oregon legislature and with federal funds from the National Endowment for the Arts as well as funds from the Oregon Cultural Trust.

               <p><strong>Stay home. Save lives.</strong></p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>
               </ul>

<p>Note to media: an FBI video soundbite on extortion scams is available for your use. Email <a href="mailto:media.Portland@fbi.gov" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">media.Portland@fbi.gov</a> if you wish to receive it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Welcome to the Oregon FBI’s Tech Tuesday segment. This week: building a digital defense against extortion scams. </p>

<p>During the COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has seen an increase in reports of online extortion scams. Because many people are staying inside and likely using the computer more than usual, scammers know they can use this opportunity to find new victims to pressure into sending money. The extortionists’ threat: they will release sexually explicit photos or personally compromising videos to the victim’s contacts if they do not pay.  </p>

<p>It’s important to remember that scammers adapt their schemes to capitalize on current events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, high-profile data breaches, or new trends involving the Internet, all in an attempt to make their scams seem more authentic. </p>

<p>Online extortion schemes vary, but there are a few common indicators. Here are some red flags:  </p>

<ul>
<li>
     <p>The online extortion attempt comes as an e-mail or letter from an unknown party and, many times, will be written in broken English with grammatical errors. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>The scammer will include the recipient's personal information – such as a user name or password - at the beginning of the message. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>The extortionist will accuse the recipient of visiting adult websites, cheating on a spouse, or being involved in other compromising situations. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>The message includes a statement such as, "I had a serious spyware and adware infect your computer," or "I have a recorded video of you" as an explanation of how he gathered the information. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>The e-mail or letter provides a short window to pay, typically 48 hours. </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
     <p>The extortionist instructs the victim to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency in an attempt to make the transaction more anonymous.    </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how to protect yourself: </p>

<ul>
<li>
     <p>Don’t open e-mails or attachments from unknown people, and don’t communicate with those who send unsolicited messages. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Don’t store sensitive or embarrassing photos or information online or on your mobile devices. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Monitor your bank account statements regularly and your credit report at least once a year for any unusual activity. </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
     <p>Use strong passwords and don’t use the same password for multiple websites. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Never provide personal information of any sort via e-mail. Be aware that many fraudulent e-mails requesting your personal information appear to be legitimate. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Make sure you have activated the security settings for social media accounts and that they are set at the highest level of protection. </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: the FBI does not condone the payment of online extortion demands as the funds will facilitate continued criminal activity, including potential organized crime activity and associated violent crimes. </p>

<p>As always, if you have been victimized by a cyber fraud, you can report it to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at <a href="http://www.IC3.gov.%C2%A0" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.IC3.gov. </a></p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133826');">Bureau of Land Management strengthens wildfire response capabilities across the West despite COVID-19</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.blm.gov/or/index.php" target="_blank">Bureau of Land Management Ore. &amp; Wash.</a> - 04/28/20 8:50 AM</span><div id="news133826" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p><em>Agency develops COVID-19 wildfire response plans to provide for fire personnel safety </em><br>
 </p>

<p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> – While taking active measures to protect the public and employees and minimize exposure to COVID-19, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) continues to reduce hazardous fuels across the West and Alaska and to plan for the upcoming fire season by maintaining and strengthening firefighting capabilities. In conjunction with Federal, state, and local partners, the BLM will use its full suite of resources to prevent and suppress wildfires as the agency adjusts to rapidly changing outbreak circumstances. </p>

<p>“We are committed to protecting our colleagues in the BLM and those with whom we come in contact during this challenging time; however, as westerners we know we must fight fire all year long and we will do exactly that,” said BLM Deputy Director for Policy and Programs William Perry Pendley.  “Guided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state and local health authorities, we continue to implement proactive COVID-19 measures to protect employees and the public, but, when it comes to fire, we have no intention of standing down.”</p>

<p>Every year, the BLM works with its Federal, state, and local partners to conduct initial attack on all wildland fire incidents to suppress wildfires as soon as they ignite.  Aggressive initial attack is the single most important method to ensure the safety of firefighters and the public; it also limits suppression costs.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, the wildland fire agencies will continue to work to suppress wildfires with the goal of reducing wildfire size and intensity. </p>

<p>The BLM is also working with its Federal, state and local partners to develop specific COVID-19 wildfire response plans to provide for wildland fire personnel safety.  These plans outline best management practices to limit the spread of the virus and to provide a safe working environment for all wildland fire personnel. </p>

<p>The wildland fire agencies maintain a full aviation fleet to suppress wildfires and concurrently plan for above-normal fire activity with additional contract and partner surge capacity.  The BLM will have on contract 34 Single Engine Airtankers (SEAT), combined with four water scoopers, seven smokejumper planes, 19 tactical support aircraft, and 25 helicopters for wildfire suppression efforts this year.  In addition, the BLM has access to more than 660 helicopters, 100 SEATs, 14 Large Airtankers and Very Large Airtankers, 22 water scoopers and over 400 tactical support aircraft through partnerships and call-when-needed contracts. </p>

<p>The BLM Fire and Aviation program works closely with, and relies on, its state and local partners for all wildfire suppression efforts.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, some state governments have declared they will not permit state and local resources to respond to wildfires outside of their local jurisdiction, which will greatly limit the national response capabilities of these valuable resources.  The BLM is working with these governments to address concerns and to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that shared resources are available to be deployed wherever need may be greatest.</p>

<p>“In order to ensure smooth interstate wildfire suppression operations, all wildland firefighters must be permitted to cross state boundaries without restriction to ensure safe and effective wildfire operations throughout the country,” said Pendley. “We beseech our federal, state, and local partners to ensure that ability.”</p>

<p>The BLM will also rely on its employees across the nation who are not full-time fire personnel but maintain essential wildfire qualifications and thus provide critical wildfire response capabilities during heightened fire activity.  These employees greatly augment the national fire workforce every year; therefore, the BLM will continue to enhance its workforce with these personnel during the COVID-19 outbreak.  The BLM and its partners will also work closely with contractors, emergency hires, and other seasonal employees, as the BLM does every year, to greatly enhance firefighting capabilities. </p>

<p>Overall, wildfire suppression operations will require adjustments and new tactics during the COVID-19 outbreak.  Fortunately, the BLM and its partner agencies are skilled in aggressive initial attack operations, as limiting wildfire spread is always paramount, no matter the situation.  The BLM and its partner agencies are prepared for wildfire response and will work to suppress all wildfires before they become large, problematic incidents. </p>

<p>-BLM–</p>

<p><em>The BLM manages more than 245 million acres of public land located primarily in 12 Western states, including Alaska. The BLM also administers 700 million acres of sub-surface mineral estate throughout the nation. In fiscal year 2018, the diverse activities authorized on BLM-managed lands generated $105 billion in economic output across the country. This economic activity supported 471,000 jobs and contributed substantial revenue to the U.S. Treasury and state governments, mostly through royalties on minerals. </em></p>

<p>(Salem) – It’s a time to remember those who died on the job. It’s a time to grieve with families, friends, and communities. It’s a moment to reflect on – and renew – our responsibility to provide and maintain safe and healthy workplaces.</p>

<p>Oregon workers who died on the job in 2019 are being honored with an online video ceremony as the official observance of Workers Memorial Day – Tuesday, April 28 – approaches. The state’s Occupational Safety and Health Division (Oregon OSHA) and the Oregon AFL-CIO invite Oregonians to view the 2020 ceremony in an online video, which was created in light of the public health crises triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The video of the memorial service, coordinated by the Oregon AFL-CIO, is now available: <a href="https://youtu.be/IicHNwQKZD4"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/IicHNwQKZD4" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/IicHNwQKZD4</a>.</p>

<p>State Sen. Shemia Fagan reads the names of Oregon workers who died on the job in 2019. Oregon OSHA Administrator Michael Wood, Oregon AFL-CIO President Graham Trainor, and Rev. Richard Davis of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Salem also make remarks.</p>

<p>“On April 28, we remember and mourn the Oregonians who died on the job as a result of workplace injuries and illness in 2019, and we recommit ourselves to protecting working people from injury and disease on the job,” Trainor said. “This issue has never been more relevant than it is right now amidst a global pandemic, and Oregon’s unions will never stop advocating for the safest workplaces possible. Today, we mourn the dead, and we commit to fight like hell for the living.”   </p>

<p>Driven by efforts on the part of labor, business, and government, Oregon has seen its workplace fatality rate steadily decline for decades. Yet, there are still far too many preventable on-the-job deaths each year.</p>

<p>“We are all in many ways more isolated than we could have imagined just a few short months ago,” Wood said. “But that is also why it is important that Workers Memorial Day not simply pass by unnoticed. Because for the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in Oregon workplaces last year, the crisis did not begin a few weeks ago. They have already experienced the greatest loss many of us will ever experience – the unexpected loss of a father, of a daughter, of a mother, of a son, or of a friend.”</p>

<p>The annual Workers Memorial Day serves as a nationwide day of remembrance. The observance is traditionally held on April 28 because Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act on that date in 1970.</p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 27, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)  </strong>The Douglas County Board of Commissioners officially reopened the Douglas County Courthouse today.  This is not to be confused with the letter sent to Oregon’s Governor last week from the five SW Oregon Counties requesting a Phase One Regional reopening. At this time, only County Government offices have been reopened.  <strong>The order to reopen Douglas County and the rest of Oregon can only come from the Oregon Governor.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The reopening at the Douglas County Courthouse incorporates very strict social distancing procedures for county employees, as well as for the visiting public.</strong>  Your Commissioners continue to urge citizens to follow the Governor’s Executive Orders to ‘Stay Home, Save Lives.’  <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/coronavirus/press_releases/04-24-20%20DCBOC%20Commissioners%20to%20Reopen%20Courthouse.pdf">Click here to read the Courthouse Reopening press release from April 25. </a>For County Employees the following procedures have been put into place: daily temperature and cough screenings; minimize contact with public and fellow employees; maintain physical distancing measures, 6 feet apart; frequently hand washing and use hand sanitizer; staggered work, break and lunch schedules; wear masks when possible; stay home if you are sick; and perform frequent cleaning and disinfecting of touched surfaces.</p>

<p>As a reminder we ask that the visiting public: only visit the courthouse if necessary; stay home if you are sick; continue to use of our online, email and phone systems first; call the Department beforehand to schedule an appointment; departmental contact information is listed on the county’s website; follow posted guidelines for department and building use in regards to entering offices, standing in line, gathering and keeping your distance from others; maintain at least 6-feet physical distance, wash your hands, wear a mask and use hand-sanitizer; plexi-glass sneeze guards are being installed in departments that work with the public; and hand sanitizer and masks will be available for the public.  </p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 27, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  For the eleventh day in a row, the total number of positives in Douglas County remains at twenty-three. Of the twenty-three, fourteen have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 920 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Two of the twenty-three people that have tested positive are still hospitalized in different hospitals.  Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Fourteen of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Get Tested</strong></p>

<p><strong>The next drive through clinic will be held tomorrow, Tuesday, April 28, 2020, in Roseburg.</strong>  If you are having symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, diarrhea, sore throat or decreased sense of smell and taste, talk to your health care provider about being tested for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Given the growing availability of commercial labs and the improving availability of testing supplies and PPE DPHN has revised their guidelines to providers on testing. DPHN has sent out communications to the local health care community alerting them of the increased availability of testing for their patients.  DPHN also announced Wednesday that Quest labs is now offering the IgG antibody test for COVID-19 locally. Both tests must be ordered by a health care provider and currently, testing without a provider order is not yet available.  </p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 370 people tested in the drive through clinics alone, additional testing continues in hospitals, urgent cares and clinics simultaneously.  The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Small Business Resource Navigator and Latest CARES Act Information</strong></p>

<p>Although there is no allocation being sent to support Douglas County Government services, there are some direct services available to small businesses.  At the direction of the State, Business Oregon has established a Small Business Resource Navigator to assist with business questions and provide help accessing existing resources. They have staff available to respond to emails and calls Monday through Friday from 8:00 am – 5:00 pm via the resource hotline at (833) 604-0880 or emailing <a href="mailto:b&lt;a%20href=" mailto:iz.covid19 rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">iz.covid19@oregon.gov</a>"&gt;<a href="mailto:biz.covid19@oregon.gov" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">biz.covid19@oregon.gov</a>.   The newest CARES Act was passed by Congress last Thursday and signed by President Trump on Friday, March 24. According to the Small Business Association (SBA) they anticipate that, “Lenders will resume accepting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications on Monday, April 27 at 10:30 am (EDT) from approved lenders on behalf of any eligible borrower. This will ensure that SBA has properly coded the system to account for changes made by the legislation.” If you are a business owner, or know of a business owner, or run a nonprofit, the time is now to apply for the PPP with a 7(a) Lender. These funds will be gone very quickly, so the sooner you are able to get things completed the better. If you need assistance with the PPP please reach out to the Small Business Resource Navigator listed above or contact a lender directly.  For the most up to date information relating to the second round of CARES funding, <a href="http://www.oregon4biz.com/assets/docs/CARESActUpdate0420.pdf.">click here.</a> You might also find some helpful advice in this <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/23/small-business-loans-we-have-answers-your-ppp-questions/5165733002/">article from USA Today</a>. </p>

<p><strong>$32 Million State Funding Package Approved to Support Oregon’s COVID-19 Response</strong></p>

<p>Although there is no allocation being sent to support Douglas County Government services, there are some direct services available to the public.  The Oregon Legislature’s Emergency Board has approved a $32 million funding package to support the state’s COVID-19 response. The assistance includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>$12 million for rental assistance and motel vouchers for those who have lost income due to COVID-19 and those at risk of infection or health problems due to inadequate housing.</li>
     <li>$5 million for small businesses. This amount, along with a matching $5 million from the Oregon Business Development Department, will create a $10 million assistance program for small businesses with up to 25 employees that have been impacted by COVID-19 and have not received support from the federal CARES Act.</li>
     <li>$2 million for emergency housing for survivors of domestic and sexual violence.</li>

     <li>$3.35 million to help workers at long-term care facilities pay for COVID-19 testing, and provide caregiver training on infectious disease prevention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Information for Those Experiencing Homelessness </strong></p>

<p>Douglas Public Health Network has created an <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/coronavirus/information/04-27-20%20DPHN%20COVID-19%20Homeless%20Information.pdf">infographic flyer</a> to distribute to those experiencing homelessness in Douglas County.  Please feel free to print, post and distribute widely.  Also, the HIV Alliance received funding to provide gift cards for hygiene products and food boxes for those who are unhoused or homeless.  These can be accessed by stopping by the HIV office located at 647 West Luellen Drive in Roseburg. </p>

<p><a name="_Hlk38272665"><strong>Watching for Signs of Stress in Young Children</strong></a></p>

<p>Children are perceptive, and may be experiencing anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic, even if they don’t express it in words. Here are some examples from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) of signs that your child may be experiencing stress:</p>

<p>Preschool-age children:      </p>

<ul>
<li>Crying or screaming</li>
     <li>Afraid to separate from parents or caregivers</li>
     <li>Not eating, or losing weight</li>
     <li>Having nightmares</li>
</ul>
<p>Elementary school-age children:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feeling guilt or shame</li>
     <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
     <li>Not sleeping well</li>
</ul>
<p>The OHA recommends that parents and caregivers talk to children about current events in a way they can understand; be calm and reassuring; and encourage children to share their fears or concerns. The CDC has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html">page on how to help children cope</a>. Parents can also visit the national Child Traumatic Stress Network’s <a href="https://www.nctsn.org/resources/parent-caregiver-guide-to-helping-families-cope-with-the-coronavirus-disease-2019">website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Tips: Self-Care Monday</strong></p>

<p>Journaling can help you process your thoughts, feelings and experiences during COVID-19. There’s something powerful about writing things down; sometimes, once a fear or concern is on paper in front of you, it doesn’t seem as overwhelming. Try taking a few minutes each day to jot down something you did or experienced that day. It can be something as simple as cooking a meal, a conversation you had with a family member, or a trip to the grocery store (although shopping can be a major event these days!). How did you feel about the event you wrote about? How do you feel overall? Afterward, read what you’ve written. Consider finishing each journal entry with a list of small things you’re grateful for – sunshine, fresh air, your cat – you name it. Focusing on the positive can help alleviate some stress.</p>

<p>As an added benefit, if you keep a journal you’ll have a record of your experiences during this historic time. Cornell University has launched a project called <a href="https://www.covid-stories.com/">“Telling Our Stories in the Age of COVID-19”</a> to collect journal entries from individuals who are willing to share their writing.</p>

<p><strong>April 28, 2020 – Salem, Ore. –</strong> After an all-nighter helping his wife get used to night shift hours, Levi Robinette and his son decided they needed an energy drink.</p>

<p>When the two visited the Jackson’s Food Store in Ontario for their dose of caffeine, Robinette got a jolt of energy when he realized he won $100,000 from one of the $10 Scratch-its he had just purchased.</p>

<p>“I walked in to get an energy drink, and I walked out with $100,000!” he said.</p>

<p>Robinette said he was glad he stayed up to support his wife.</p>

<p>“My wife is also my manager at work, so I figured it would be in my best interest to stay up,” Robinette said. “It really was!”</p>

<p>He said he splurged after claiming his prize last week and bought a motorcycle, but otherwise he is saving the money.</p>

<p>“Normally we play Video Lottery, but with that closed, we decided that this would be fun to try,” he said. “I’m glad we did. It was fun.”</p>

<p>Robinette claimed his prize after making an appointment and visiting the Salem headquarters last week.</p>

<p>To protect the health and safety of its employees and the public, the Oregon Lottery has temporarily closed the Salem and Wilsonville Lottery offices. Officials with the Lottery continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. If players have a winning ticket, they can fill out a claim form on the Oregon Lottery website, <a href="https://oregonlottery.org/about/claim-prizes"></a><a href="https://oregonlottery.org/about/claim-prizes" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://oregonlottery.org/about/claim-prizes</a> , and then mail in the signed ticket and claim form.</p>

<p>Players who have winning tickets of $50,000 or more, will need to make an appointment to come to the Oregon Lottery office in Salem. Call 503-540-1000 for assistance. As always, players should be certain to sign the back of their tickets.<br>
Since 1985, Oregon Lottery players have won more than $38 billion in prizes.</p>

<p>The Oregon Lottery reminds players to always sign the back of their Lottery tickets, regardless of the game. In the event of winning a jackpot, they should consult with a trusted financial planner or similar professional to develop a plan for their winnings. Prize winners of more than $50,000 are advised to contact the Lottery office and schedule an appointment to claim their prize.</p>

<p><em>Since the Oregon Lottery began selling tickets on April 25, 1985, it has earned more than $12 billion for economic development, public education, Outdoor School, state parks, Veterans services and watershed enhancements.

<p>Salem, Ore. – Governor Kate Brown has named Anis Mojgani (AH-neess Mozh-GAH-nee), a two-time individual champion of the National Poetry Slam and an International World Cup Poetry Slam winner, to a two-year appointment as Poet Laureate of Oregon. Mojgani succeeds Kim Stafford, who has held the post since 2018, to become Oregon’s 10th Poet Laureate.</p>

<p>“Anis is the pragmatic optimist Oregon needs in these unprecedented times,” said Governor Brown. “His words breathe fresh air into the anxiety and negativity that we all feel. He urges us to resolutely reflect in the moment and with each grounding breath, our hearts ‘come closer and come into this.’”</p>

<p>Born in New Orleans to Black and Iranian parents, Mojgani first called Oregon home in 2004. He is the author of five books of poetry including his latest, “In the Pockets of Small Gods.” Mojgani has also done commissioned work for the Getty Museum and the Peabody Essex Museum, and the premiere of his first opera libretto, “Sanctuaries,” is scheduled for April 2021. His work has appeared on HBO, National Public Radio, in the Academy of American Poets Poem-A-Day series, and in the pages of such journals as Rattle, Platypus, Winter Tangerine, Forklift Ohio and Bat City Review. His performance credits include hundreds of universities across the U.S. as well as international festivals such as the Sydney Writer’s Festival, Jamaica’s Calabash festival and Seoul’s Young Writer’s Festival. His audiences range from the United Nations to the House of Blues and Portland’s Pickathon music festival.</p>

<p>“It's always exciting and difficult to participate in the selection process for Oregon's Poet Laureate,” said Adam Davis, executive director of Oregon Humanities, who administers the Poet Laureate program on behalf of the Cultural Trust. “Oregon has such deep poetry ecology, it’s challenging for the selection committee to coalesce around one candidate as their recommendation to the Governor.</p>

<p>“However, the collective enthusiasm for the prospect of Anis as the next Oregon Poet Laureate was exceptional,” he said. “We're lucky to have Anis in Oregon, and we're delighted that so many people around the state will get to know his poetry and presence better – while getting to know each other and our state better as well.”</p>

<p>First coming to poetry by way of visual arts, Mojgani earned a BFA in Sequential Art from the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design in Georgia. He has been awarded artist and writer residencies from the Vermont Studio Center, AIR Serenbe, The Bloedel Nature Reserve and The Sou’wester. He has taught and mentored for Portland’s Writers-In-The-Schools, in the KSMoCA Artist Mentorship program and at Wallowa County’s Fishtrap, and currently serves on the board of directors for Literary Arts. Mojgani resides in Portland.</p>

<p>“I believe all of us wish to be seen on some level, to be heard,” said Mojgani. “For then we get a little closer to being known and understood. The closer we get to that, the more we are able to see and understand how we belong to the world we are a part of -- To belong. That is what poetry does – it gives us all the power and path to being known, both to ourselves and to others. It shows the ways in which we as humans, while carrying our aloneness, also belong and are connected to one another. The poem illuminates this collectiveness.</p>

<p>“And in a state I was not born in but have a belonging to, I am overjoyed and honored to find the ways to further how as Oregonians we might become more known to one another,” Mojgani added.</p>

<p>A 20-person committee of writers, poets and cultural leaders reviewed nominations in February and made its recommendation to the Cultural Trust and its statewide partners - Oregon Arts Commission, Oregon Historical Society, the Oregon Heritage Commission, Oregon Humanities and the State Historic Preservation Office. The Governor approved the committee’s recommendation last week.</p>

<p>The Oregon Poet Laureate fosters the art of poetry, encourages literacy and learning, addresses central issues relating to humanities and heritage, and reflects on public life in Oregon. Mojgani will provide up to 20 public readings per year in settings across the state to inform community, business and state leaders about the value and importance of poetry and creative expression. The program is funded by the Oregon Cultural Trust.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>

</div>
<p>SALEM, Ore. – May is Wildfire Awareness Month. Keep Oregon Green, in partnership with federal, state and local fire agencies and organizations, knows May is a great time to encourage the public to create defensible space around homes this spring and prevent the start of careless, unwanted wildfires.</p>

<p><strong>At stake: Lives, property, forests</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to preventing wildfires, there’s a lot at stake – lives, personal property, and the many benefits provided by Oregon’s forests and rangelands. During the 2019 season, 250,000 acres in the Northwest were consumed by wildfire, with almost 80,000 acres burned in Oregon.</p>

<p>People were responsible for starting 1,192 fires that burned around 22,000 acres. ODF's gross large-fire costs were $32.8 million, and many neighborhoods were forced to evacuate. Each year, over 70 percent of Oregon's wildfires are started by people. Many are a result of escaped debris burning and campfires left unattended. </p>

<pre>
Before heading outdoors, contact the agency or landowner who manages the lands at your destination for an update on current fire restrictions or bans. Any visitor to Oregon’s natural areas should review these restrictions before building campfires, burning debris, or using equipment that could ignite dry vegetation. 
</pre>

<p><strong>Oregon, Our Oregon</strong></p>

<p>This year, Keep Oregon Green is launching a new wildfire prevention campaign and releasing four new public service announcements to help raise awareness. The announcements feature movie, television and voice actor Sam Elliott, who is the official voice of Smokey Bear. Each announcement will encourage residents and tourists to practice basic wildfire safety while enjoying the outdoors. Elliott has a home in Oregon and has experienced fire first-hand near his other home in California, so he well understands the fire risk that threatens our state every year.</p>

<p>Pride in Oregon is the driving force behind Keep Oregon Green’s campaign and new website. Stunning campaign photos of Oregon’s iconic landscapes will encourage everyone to protect our state’s scenic recreation areas. Using the hashtag, #OregonOurOregon, Keep Oregon Green wants you to share photos of your favorite natural areas and thoughts for keeping Oregon free of wildfire. The new campaign artwork, PSAs, and additional wildfire safety tips can be found at keeporegongreen.org and its various social media platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Coming soon: More Wildfire Awareness Month tips </strong></p>

<p>During May, a new wildfire prevention topic will be shared each week to help homeowners and recreationists learn how to prevent their outdoor activities from sparking the next wildfire. For more information, visit the websites for Keep Oregon Green at <a href="http://www.keeporegongreen.org," rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.keeporegongreen.org,</a> and the Oregon Department of Forestry at <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/odf"></a><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/odf" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.oregon.gov/odf</a>.</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133796');">Sponsors Inc and Lane County Announce COVID-19 Recovery Solution For Some of Lane County's Most Vulnerable Community Members</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.lanecountyor.gov" target="_blank">Lane Co. Government</a> - 04/27/20 6:37 AM</span><div id="news133796" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>EUGENE, ORE --Sponsors Inc has generously agreed to provide as many as 10 tiny home units from their Jeffery Commons project for COVID-19 recovery for unhoused individuals. These units were recently constructed and will be made available on a temporary basis to Lane County free of charge. Lane County will oversee placement, recovery services, and clean-up. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“We recognized the need to provide critical housing to some of our most vulnerable community members by providing a place to recover from severe illness, and are happy to help provide that,” said Sponsors Inc Executive Director, Paul Solomon. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Lane County purchased the former VA Clinic at 100 River Ave. earlier this month to serve as COVID-19 recovery, but was in need of a temporary solution pending renovations of that facility. Typically, Lane County uses vouchers to pay for hotel rooms for individuals who have been diagnosed with a communicable illness and are in need of a place to isolate and recover, and while hotel locations were identified in rural Lane County, that solution proved untenable in the Eugene/Springfield area during COVID-19. Recently, Ordinance 20-03 was proposed to the Lane County Board of Commissioners acting as the Board of Health which would have required hotels and motels to accept payment vouchers during an emergency, and in doing so provide space for recovering COVID-19 patients. This development negates the need for Ordinance 20-03.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“This act of generosity and leadership during such a difficult time demonstrates what our community has come to know about Sponsors; that they are a trusted community partner who has made it their mission to strengthen our community by identifying gaps and working to fill them,” said Lane County Health &amp; Human Services Director and COVID-19 Emergency Response Lead, Karen Gaffney. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Tiny Home Community is funded in part with grants from the Meyer Memorial Trust, The Collins Foundation, Lane County Housing Improvement Program, the Oregon Community Foundation, and generous community donations.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sponsors transforms lives and strengthens the community by providing life-changing opportunities for people with conviction histories. Sponsors offers a broad range of services—housing, employment, counseling, and mentoring—that people need to be successful.</p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 26, 2020</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)  </strong>Most Americans are spending more and more time online these days.  Just like you, scammers are doing the same.  They have created campaigns to exploit the fear and confusion around COVID-19.  Don’t fall for it!  Google recently reported that they saw more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 during the second week of April.  It’s a sign that scammers have heightened their game once again and are trying to exploit the COVID-19 crisis.  The 18 million is on top of the more than 240 million daily spam coronavirus messages they recorded.  The attacks and scams attempt to use both fear and the promise of monetary gain to create a sense of urgency in order to entice users to respond.  It is the same old game, just with a new subject line. </p>

<p>The scams include impersonating government or nonprofit organizations like the CDC and Food Pantries, to try to seek donations or trick users into downloading malware.  Or they pretend to be from the IRS with information about government stimulus payments.  Or the scammer says they are associated with your employer and are offering added bonus incentives to employees. </p>

<p>Google said they have upped their game by targeting their artificial intelligence-powered protections filter at these threats.  We hope you do the same, up your defenses and game.  Make sure you apply these cautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t click links in emails you weren’t expecting</li>
     <li>Report suspicious and phishing emails to the Oregon Attorney General or the FBI.</li>
     <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it is probably fake.</li>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 26, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  The total number of positives in Douglas County remains at twenty-three.   Of the twenty-three, fourteen have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 891 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Two of the twenty-three people that have tested positive are still hospitalized in different hospitals.  Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Fourteen of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Get Tested</strong></p>

<p>If you are having symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, diarrhea, sore throat or decreased sense of smell and taste, talk to your health care provider about being tested for COVID-19. Given the growing availability of commercial labs and the improving availability of testing supplies and PPE DPHN has revised their guidelines to providers on testing. DPHN has sent out communications to the local health care community alerting them of the increased availability of testing for their patients.  DPHN also announced Wednesday that Quest labs is now offering the IgG antibody test for COVID-19 locally. Both tests must be ordered by a health care provider and currently, testing without a provider order is not yet available.  </p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 370 people tested in the drive through clinics alone, additional testing continues in hospitals, urgent cares and clinics simultaneously.  The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>$13.2 Billion in Federal Emergency Relief Available to Support K-12 Education</strong></p>

<p>State and local education agencies are eligible to receive more than $13.2 billion in newly available emergency relief funds to support continued learning for K-12 students whose education has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced Thursday.</p>

<p>The funding was authorized under the CARES Act, which was signed by President Trump last month. Education leaders will be able to use funds from the Elementary and Secondary School Education Relief Fund (ESSER Fund) for immediate needs such as distance-learning tools, planning for the coming school year and ensuring student health and safety, according to the Department of Education.</p>

<p>ESSER funds are intended to be flexible, as long as they are used in ways that comply with federal education laws. State education agencies must allocate 90 percent of ESSER funds to local education agencies. Oregon is eligible to receive $121 million of that funding, according to a <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/files/2020/04/ESSER-Fund-State-Allocations-Table.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">state-by-state breakdown</a>. State education agencies have until July 1 to apply for ESSER funds.</p>

<p>The Department of Education’s <a href="https://www.ed.gov/coronavirus?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">COVID-19 page</a> contains links for parents, such as a section on “at-home activities,” as well as resources for students, educators and local leaders.</p>

<p><strong>State Launches New Phase of COVID-19 Outreach, Education</strong></p>

<p>A new statewide campaign called “Safe + Strong” is focusing on connecting at-risk Oregonians with the information, tools and resources they need to stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new program, launched Thursday by the Oregon Health Authority (OHA), offers community-centered outreach in 12 languages.  The outreach targets people who are facing economic and other barriers to keeping themselves and their families safe – such as lack of housing, not enough money to stock up on groceries, an inability to work remotely, dependence on a caregiver and those with chronic medical conditions. The target audiences include immigrants and refugees, people of color, non-English speakers, older Oregonians, migrant and seasonal farm workers, and hourly-wage essential workers. The governor’s office and OHA will be working with community leaders and organizations representing underserved groups. The “Safe + Strong” <a href="https://www.safestrongoregon.org/">website</a> highlights resources related to food, rental assistance, unemployment, Oregon Health plan and other needs. The campaign also includes a digital, radio and print campaign to increase awareness about the website.</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk38272665"><strong>Daily Tips: Backyard Sunday</strong></a></p>

<p>There’s a lot you and your kids can learn from the backyard – especially now that we have time to quiet down, listen and observe. Today’s tip is to create a nature journal to chronicle all of the interesting things you see in your yard. Sit back and watch, and get to know the critters that live there or come to visit – squirrels, birds, spiders, etc. Spring has sprung, and it’s also a great time to watch flowers bloom and plant life come alive. Write down your observations – and draw pictures, if you’re so inclined. It’s amazing how interesting the little things become if we truly pay attention to them! This site has instructions on how to <a href="https://urbanecologycenter.org/item/1318-make-a-nature-journal-with-things-you-already-have-at-home-crea-un-diario-de-la-naturaleza-usando-cosas-que-ya-tienes-en-casa.html">make a nature journal</a> with items lying around the house.</p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p><a name="_Hlk38616481"><strong>DCCRT Partner Spotlight: Aviva Health</strong></a></p>

<p>Aviva Health is one of many partners involved in steering Douglas County’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its CEO KC Bolton has been co-leading that effort along with Teresa Mustchler of Douglas Public Health Network.</p>

<p><a href="http://aviva.health/about-us/">Aviva</a>, formerly known as Umpqua Community Health Center (UCHC), started as a free walk-in clinic in downtown Roseburg in 1992 and has since expanded to eight locations. The nonprofit, a federally qualified health center, became Aviva Health in September; Bolton said “Aviva” is the Hebrew word for hope, or springtime, and is also a verb that connotes themes like “rekindle, recover, renew” in Spanish. He noted the name is also a palindrome. Aviva Health’s services include primary care, dental care, behavioral health services and some specialty care.</p>

<p>“Our mission is to take care of the underserved and see folks regardless of their ability to pay,” Bolton said.</p>

<p>Aviva Health has long worked closely with the County, and Bolton said County leaders including Commissioner Tim Freeman have been great partners over the years, including helping them find land and leasing a building. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, it was only natural that Aviva would be part of the collaborative approach to battling the virus’ spread. And, with 28 years of service under his belt in the U.S. Army’s medical department, Bolton was primed for the fight. He was named co-incident commander of the Douglas County Covid-19 Response Team (DCCRT), along with Mutschler.  He said his training as a military medical operations planner came in handy.</p>

<p>“It’s a lot like battlefield medicine,” he said.</p>

<p>Aviva is now poised to stand up two alternative care sites, including one on the coast, to help take the burden off of hospitals should there be a surge in COVID-19 cases. “We have the guiding principle to protect the hospitals,” he said. “The hospitals are where the fight is, and we need to protect their ability to serve very sick patients who need to be on ventilators. So, anything that will take the pressure off the hospitals is helpful.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Aviva is complying with a state order that halted all non-urgent procedures, including its dental services. That order will be lifted May 1, but Bolton said Aviva will be approaching the reopening cautiously to ensure it has an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE).   Clinics remain open, and dental hygienists and other staff have been reassigned to administer screening outside the door. Anyone with a cough or fever is redirected to Aviva’s respiratory clinic. Many patients are being seen through “telehealth” visits by phone or video. </p>

<p>The DCCRT is a broad coalition of local partners that includes Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas Public Health Network, Mercy Medical Center, Lower Umpqua Hospital, Umpqua Health, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Adapt, the Red Cross, Evergreen Family Medicine, Douglas Forest Patrol and others. “It’s unprecedented the way we’re all working together,” Bolton said.</p>

<p>With Oregonians staying home to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, fewer cars are on the road. Due to the reduced risk of accidents, some auto insurance companies are offering premium refunds and credits to Oregon residents. The state Division of Financial Regulation has been working with a number of auto insurance companies to offer this flexibility to customers.</p>

<p>“The Division encourages all carriers to consider providing refunds that reflect the reduced risk of auto liabilities due to the emergency (stay-at-home) order,” state officials said. “This includes taking steps to reclassify vehicle usage, and properly adjusting any mileage-based policy metrics.”  </p>

<p>The state agency provided guidance to insurance carriers last week on how to process refund filings and get the money to consumers as quickly as possible. Companies’ participation is voluntary. Here is a <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/insure/health/understand/Documents/DFR_AutoInfographic.pdf">list of participating insurance companies</a>. Contact your insurance company with questions about how to obtain your premium refund. If you have issues or complaints about an insurance company or agent, contact the Division’s advocacy team at (888) 877-4894 or <a href="mailto:dfr&lt;a%20href=" mailto:.insurancehelp rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">.insurancehelp@oregon.gov</a>"&gt;<a href="mailto:dfr.insurancehelp@oregon.gov" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">dfr.insurancehelp@oregon.gov</a>.</p>

<p>You can also visit the agency’s <a href="dfr.oregon.gov">website</a>.  Additionally, the state has also asked insurers to provide temporary private passenger auto insurance for drivers delivering food, prescriptions and other products. Other insurance-related information is available on the Division of Financial Regulation’s <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/insure/health/understand/Pages/coronavirus.aspx">COVID-19 page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Tips: Hobby and Craft Saturday</strong></p>

<p>Today’s tip: Try your hand at making pressed-flower art! If you have access to flowers and interesting plants in your backyard or around your neighborhood, you could be an artist in no time. All you’ll need besides the flowers is a heavy book, glue, paper, rubber bands, and a simple frame. After picking a variety of flowers, fold a piece of paper in half, place a flower inside the fold, then insert the folded paper containing the flower into the book. Use the rubber bands to hold the book shut if needed. Repeat with all your flowers/plants. Let them sit for 2 weeks. Then remove your pressed flowers from the book and glue them onto a paper background, arranging them into a pleasing display, and put the creation into a frame – voila! You’ve created your very own art to brighten up your living room. This<a href="https://www.sunset.com/home-garden/diy-projects/pressed-flower-art"> video</a> shows the whole process.</p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 24, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)</strong>  The Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team (DCCRT) held a press conference today to provide a comprehensive overview of the accomplishments and emergency preparations of the DCCRT team and our agency partners in response to the COVID-19 crisis and current events.  Our team of local leaders and health professionals spoke about DCCRT planning, emergency management, public safety, clinical updates, local health agency status, economic impact and reopening Douglas County. </p>

<p>Commissioner Chris Boice opened the conference and talked about our letter to Governor Brown asking for a regional approach to her <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/coronavirus/information/04-20-20%20Reopening%20Oregon%20Framework%20Concept.jpg">Phase One Reopening Oregon plans</a> that suggested an earlier safe re-opening plan for SW Oregon Counties including: Douglas, Coos, Curry, Josephine and Jackson.  Of course the reopening would be under the authority of Oregon’s Governor and the guidelines she sets forth.  All five SW Oregon counties voted unanimously to approve and sign the letter that will be sent to the Governor today.  <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/coronavirus/press_releases/04-22-20%20BOC%20Letter%20to%20Governor%20Phase%201%20Reopening.pdf">Click here to read a copy of the letter.</a></p>

<p>Commissioner Tim Freeman followed with a discussion about how the DCCRT was formed and the collaborative efforts by all of those involved with the EOC, including Douglas County Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff, Douglas County Public Works, Douglas County Building Facilities, Douglas Public Health Network, Dr. Bob Dannenhoffer (Public Health Officer), Aviva Health, Lower Umpqua Hospital, US Forest Service, Roseburg VA, Mercy Medical Center, Umpqua Health Alliance, Evergreen Medicine, Douglas Forest Protective Association, Red Cross and the Joint Information Team.  He then spoke about reopening our region and the incredible team of local medical professionals who are ready to handle capacity, testing, screening and treatment if the outbreak spikes in our area.</p>

<p>KC Bolton, CEO of Aviva Health and the DCCRT CO-Incident Commander addressed the media with a message about hope for the future.  He is optimistic because we have local healthcare organizations that have worked positively together in unprecedented ways to create a plan that supports our hospitals, and they ready for whatever comes our way.  </p>

<p>Bolton stated that, “The county’s low case rate is not an accident, but a result of the County’s and DPHN’s hard work and the public taking seriously the call to implement social distancing.  Our team believe in the value of every human life, and our mission is to save as many lives of Douglas County citizens as possible regardless of ethnicity, socio-economic status, gender identification or political affiliation.”  </p>

<p>Commissioner Kress made the announcement that after being closed for 33 days, the Douglas County Courthouse will be reopening on Monday, April 27, 2020, but with very strict social distancing procedures to provide a safe and healthy workplace for our employees and the visiting public. Click here to read the complete <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/coronavirus/press_releases/04-24-20%20DCBOC%20Commissioners%20to%20Reopen%20Courthouse.pdf">Reopening Courthouse press release</a>.</p>

<p>Those procedures include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Urging citizens to follow the Governors executive orders to ‘Stay Home, Save Lives.’</li>
     <li>Only visit the courthouse if necessary</li>
     <li>Ask the public to please stay home if you are sick.</li>
     <li>Encourage citizens to continue to utilize our online, email and phone systems as your primary point of service. </li>
     <li>For citizens who need to visit and conduct business at the courthouse, we strongly encourage you to call the office beforehand to schedule an appointment. </li>
     <li>Departmental contact information is listed on the county’s website. </li>
     <li>If you are visibly sick, you will be asked to leave. </li>
     <li>Please follow posted guidelines for department and building use in regards to entering offices, standing in line, gathering and keeping your distance from others. </li>
     <li>For the safety of everyone, please keep at least 6-feet between you and everyone else at all times, wash your hands often, wear a mask when possible, use hand-sanitizer and stay home if you are sick. </li>
     <li>Hands-free sanitizers will be available at the main entrances to the courthouse, and each individual department will have hand sanitizer and masks available for the public.  </li>
</ul>
<p>We also heard from Dr. Bob Dannenhoffer, Douglas County Public Health Official about the current status of COVID-19 in our county; how immensely we are prepared for any case surges; how we will address any outbreaks( if they should happen), and how proud is for our citizens for staying true to the orders from the state and keeping themselves healthy.</p>

<p>Additionally, agency partners, Dr. Jason Gray, Chief Medical Officer with Mercy Medical Center; Shawn Tyson, Executive Assistant to the Associate Director and VA Incident Commander; Dr. Tanveer Bokkari, VP, Quality &amp; Health Equity with Umpqua Health Alliance and Ryan Fowler, Chief Administrative Officer with Lower Umpqua Hospital (via proxy of Commissioner Kress) all spoke about what they are doing to ensure the safety of their employees, their internal incident commands, their role in the DCCRT, the opening of non-medical procedures and the cooperation of our entire medical community. </p>

<p>Our Douglas County Sheriff, John Hanlin spoke about the amazing work our Emergency Manager Wayne Stinson has done in the DCCRT and in working with state and federal partners to find and acquire resources.  He also spoke about the great work his team of deputies, 911 dispatchers and staff have done in continuing to provide services despite the crisis. Hanlin ended with a sincere thank you to the public for their cooperation in staying home during this difficult time. </p>

<p>Commissioner Boice and Freeman wrapped up the conference with a few questions from the media and expressed their thanks to the DCCRT agency partners, team members and to our citizens for their help in keeping our numbers low and staying safe at home.   <em>(Coming soon: We will be releasing an online video of the entire press conference on the County’s website and Facebook page soon, so stay tuned in for the link.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 24, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  The total number of positives in Douglas County remains at twenty-three. <strong>The report from OHA yesterday showed Douglas County had a new case bumping the county to 24, but that was a typo and has since been corrected. <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ERD/Pages/OregonReports51NewCOVID19Cases3NewDeaths.aspx">Click here</a> to read Oregon JIC Press Release issued today with the correction.</strong>  Douglas County still has twenty-three positive cases.   Of the twenty-three, fourteen have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 796 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Two of the twenty-three people that have tested positive are still hospitalized in different hospitals.  Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Fourteen of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Get Tested</strong></p>

<p>If you are having symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, diarrhea, sore throat or decreased sense of smell and taste, talk to your health care provider about being tested for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Given the growing availability of commercial labs and the improving availability of testing supplies and PPE DPHN has revised their guidelines to providers on testing. DPHN has sent out communications to the local health care community alerting them of the increased availability of testing for their patients.  DPHN also announced Wednesday that Quest labs is now offering the IgG antibody test for COVID-19 locally. Testing without a provider order is not yet available.</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk38272665"><strong>Office of the State Fire Marshal Extends Rules Allowing for Self-Serve Gas to May 9, 2020</strong></a></p>

<p>The Office of the State Fire Marshal extended the temporary rule change that allows Oregon gas stations to provide self-service on a voluntary basis, in order to address shortages of workers experienced by gas retailers statewide.  The rules change was first announced on March 28 and then extended on April 11 to April 25. Today, State Fire Marshal Jim Walker extended the deadline another two weeks, through May 9.</p>

<p>“We want to thank Oregonians and Oregon businesses for being flexible during these challenging times,” said Walker. “As we continue to monitor this ongoing situation, we feel it is best to extend this option for an additional two weeks.”</p>

<p>The extension of the change will still allow station attendants to help customers while avoiding face-to-face and hand-to-hand contact. It also continues to ensure physical distancing measures are in place. Attendants will continue to sanitize station equipment and fuel nozzles and assist customers with their refueling as needed. Self-service is not mandatory. This option allows some fueling stations to maintain their operations with fewer workers and lets Oregonians, particularly essential workers who must travel, still commute without the uncertainty of not being able to find open gas stations. Unattended self-service is permitted when a gas station owner exhausts all staffing options. Stations that do not have an attendant on duty are still required to post safety signs for physical distancing and instructions showing customers how to operate a fuel pump correctly. This extension of the self-service rules change has not affected areas of the state that were already authorized for self-service refueling under state law.  Information about the extended rules change for self-service gasoline can be found on the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/osp/programs/sfm/Pages/Self-Service-Rules-Change-FAQs.aspx">OSFM website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2020 Douglas County Fair</strong></p>

<p>The 2020 Douglas County FAIR is still scheduled to take place from August 4 thru August 8 this summer. Today they    announced that <strong>Country Artist, Brett Young </strong>will perform on <strong>Wednesday, August 5 at 7:30 pm</strong>, in the Amphitheater.  All concerts are FREE with Fair Admission; Reserved Seating will be available for purchase.  Keep watching their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/douglascountyfair">Facebook page</a> for more exciting news on the 2020 Douglas County Fair.  Please note that they will continue to assess the current Social Distancing regulations and keep you up to date with any changes including when tickets will be on SALE.</p>

<p><strong>President Signs $484 Billion Bill That Revives Paycheck Protection Program for Small Businesses</strong></p>

<p>President Trump today signed a $484 billion bill that includes $320 billion to revive the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. The bill also includes $75 billion for hospitals, and $25 billion for COVID-19 testing.</p>

<p>The Paycheck Protection Program was initially funded at about $349 billion through a bill passed in late March. However, due to overwhelming demand, the funds ran out quickly. This will give businesses with up to 500 employees another shot at applying for the loans, which are forgivable if the business is able to avoid layoffs or quickly re-hire employees previously laid off. Applications must be made through local lending institutions; contact your bank if you are interested in applying. Many lenders struggled to set up and process applications when the program first launched, and some businesses missed the window to apply; now, small-businesses will have another opportunity. However, the Consumer Bankers Association warned this week that much of the new funding may be eaten up by existing applications that were still in the queue when the initial pot of funding ran out. Of the new $320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, $60 billion is reserved for smaller lenders. PPP loans can be for up to $10 million; the size of the loans is based on each company’s payroll size. Each business can apply for one loan. The new legislation, the fourth coronavirus relief bill signed into law by President Trump, also adds $50 billion to the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, and $10 billion to the SBA’S Emergency Economic Injury Disaster Grant program.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Tips: Dinner-and-a-Movie Friday</strong></p>

<p>Tonight’s meal recommendation: Spaghetti and meatballs! Involve your kids in the preparation, then kick back and watch a movie with an Italian theme or where spaghetti makes a cameo. Some ideas: The Disney classic “Lady and the Tramp,” “Elf,” or “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.” For grown-ups, consider these classics: “Moonstruck,” “Eat, Pray Love,” or (for an edgier evening) “The Godfather.” If you’re looking to cut down on carbs, here’s a recipe for <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241980/zucchini-spaghetti/">zucchini spaghetti</a>.

<h2><strong>Find local farm stands, CSAs with Oregon’s Bounty</strong></h2>

<p>SALEM, OREGON, April 24, 2020: Among the heroes of these unprecedented times are Oregon’s farmers and ranchers. These hard-working families have continued to<strong> </strong>grow their crops, care for their animals, and provide food for society, along with other vital agricultural products.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, Oregonians are searching for locally grown vegetables, fruit, meat, eggs, cheese, nuts, honey, and other products like flowering baskets, vegetable starts, and bedding plants.</p>

<p>Oregon’s Bounty, at <a href="https://oregonfb.org/oregonsbounty/"><strong>OregonFB.org/oregonsbounty</strong></a>, is a searchable directory of nearly 300 family farms and ranches that sell food, foliage, and other ag products directly to the public.</p>

<p>“Oregon’s Bounty includes farm stands and CSAs from across the entire state, and the directory includes contact information,” said Anne Marie Moss, Oregon Farm Bureau communications director.</p>

<p>“It’s important to check with a farm online or by email or phone before visiting to see if their opening date has changed. Farms and ranches that are selling to the public will be taking every precaution to make sure their products, their customers, their employees, their families, and themselves remain as healthy and safe as possible. Some farm stands may have specific instructions for customers, such as online ordering or pickup options,” said Moss. </p>

<p>Spring favorites that are in season now include asparagus, rhubarb, salad greens, artichokes, radishes, mushrooms, flowering baskets, bedding plants, vegetable starts — with Oregon-grown strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries not far behind.</p>

<p>Oregon’s Bounty allows visitors to do keyword searches for specific ag products — such as blueberries, cucumbers, honey, or eggs — and/or search for farms and ranches within a specific region of the state.</p>

<p>“While so much of society has come to a stand-still, Farm Bureau members are #StillFarming and #StillRanching, and for that, we are all very grateful,” said Moss. “A lot has changed but the love Oregonians have for locally sourced food has not. We encourage everyone to support their local farms and ranches and to continue enjoying Oregon’s incredible agricultural bounty.”</p>

<p>Portland<strong> – </strong>Aiming to increase job safety awareness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Oregon State Building Trades Council has launched a task force to help construction contractors follow current guidelines and protect workers while continuing to do business.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 Joint Construction Safety Task Force – encompassing representatives from the building trades unions, industry partners, management, and employer representatives – has been meeting online three times a week and scheduling visits to various construction sites in Oregon<em>.</em></p>

<p>A group of five to seven task force members, assisted by Oregon OSHA consultants, are visiting sites to assess the effectiveness of job safety practices intended to address COVID-19 and to make recommendations for improvements. All task force members and Oregon OSHA consultants will practice social distancing while visiting construction job sites. At the same time, the task force – an advisory group – is monitoring the most current health information and government guidelines, and collecting data and information about best jobsite practices. This data and information will be shared with construction contractors and workers.</p>

<p>“The safety of the people who are out there working on construction sites is our highest priority,” said Robert Camarillo, executive secretary for the Oregon State Building Trades Council. “With this task force, our goal is to improve job safety and increase educational resources during an incredibly challenging time.”</p>

<p>Oregon Gov. Kate Brown’s “Stay Home, Save Lives” <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf">executive order</a> – issued in response to the coronavirus outbreak – does not include construction among the businesses that must close.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 Joint Construction Safety Task Force is a partnership of union and non-union industry professionals, with support from Oregon OSHA. Its membership includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Associated General Contractors-Oregon Columbia Chapter</li>
     <li>Central Building and Construction Trades Council</li>
     <li>Columbia-Pacific Building and Construction Trades Council</li>

<p><em>BLM Medford District contributes to public archaeology project that is rewriting the role of the Chinese Oregonians in the history of the state. </em></p>

<p><strong>Medford, Oregon –</strong> The Bureau of Land Management Medford District is one of several partners recognized for work on the Oregon Chinese Diaspora Project. The 2020 Oregon Heritage Excellence Award recognized the project for its outsized impact on the preservation and interpretation of the state’s heritage. The award is given each year by the Oregon Heritage Commission.</p>

<p>The Oregon Chinese Diaspora Project is led by Southern Oregon University Laboratory of Anthropology. The grassroots partnership of federal, state, and local entities has spread across the state, with a focus in underserved rural communities in southern and eastern Oregon. This public archaeology project is helping rewrite the significant yet neglected history of the Chinese diaspora and Chinese Oregonians. Partners leveraged their limited individual resources and local relationships into an extraordinary program that uses innovative approaches to promote appreciation of Oregon’s cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The Buck Rock Tunnel, high in the mountains of BLM’s Cascade Siskiyou National Monument, is one of the best places to learn about this history.  BLM Archaeologist Lisa Rice has worked for years to increase public access to the tunnel and awareness of the Chinese laborers who built it. Rice, in partnership with Chelsea Rose of Southern Oregon University, has hosted summer field schools for archaeology students. These immersive programs provide field experience excavating and preserving the tunnel and associated history. The site features a trailhead and kiosk with plans for interpretive signs that help connect visitors with the past. </p>

<p>The Oregon Heritage Commission identified the Oregon Chinese Diaspora Project as having made outstanding contributions to preserving Oregon heritage. The multi-agency collaboration is supported by the Malheur National Forest, the Southern Oregon University Laboratory of Anthropology, Oregon State Parks, the Kam Wah Chung State Heritage Site, the Oregon Historical Society, and the Bureau of Land Management Medford District. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Commissioners continue to urge citizens to follow the Governors executive orders to <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf">‘Stay Home, Save Lives.’</a></p>

<p>In order to provide a safe and healthy workplace for our employees and the visiting public, we ask that you only visit the courthouse if necessary and to please stay home if you are sick.  We encourage citizens to continue to utilize our online, email and phone systems as your primary point of service.  For citizens who need to visit and conduct business at the courthouse, we strongly encourage you to call the office beforehand to schedule an appointment.  Departmental contact information is listed on the county’s <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/">website</a>.  We ask all citizens to exercise appropriate caution personally, as well as act responsibly to maintain a healthy, supportive and safe environment for our employees and others around you.  If you are visibly sick, you will be asked to leave.  Please follow posted guidelines for department and building use in regards to entering offices, standing in line, gathering and keeping your distance from others.  For the safety of everyone, please keep at least 6-feet between you and everyone else at all times, wash your hands often, wear a mask when possible, use hand-sanitizer and stay home if you are sick.  Hands-free sanitizers will be available at the main entrances to the courthouse, and each individual department will have hand sanitizer and masks available for the public.   </p>

<p><strong>April 24, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>Office of the State Fire Marshal Extends Rules Allowing for Self-Serve Gas to May 9, 2020</strong></p>

<p>The Office of the State Fire Marshal is extending a temporary rule change that allows Oregon gas stations to provide self-service on a voluntary basis, in order to address shortages of workers experienced by gas retailers statewide.<br>
The rules change was first announced on March 28 and then extended on April 11 to April 25. Today, State Fire Marshal Jim Walker extended the deadline another two weeks, through May 9.</p>

<p>“We want to thank Oregonians and Oregon businesses for being flexible during these challenging times,” said Walker. “As we continue to monitor this ongoing situation, we feel it is best to extend this option for an additional two weeks.”</p>

<p>The extension of the change will still allow station attendants to help customers while avoiding face-to-face and hand-to-hand contact. It also continues to ensure physical distancing measures are in place. Attendants will continue to sanitize station equipment and fuel nozzles and assist customers with their refueling as needed.</p>

<p>Self-service is not mandatory. This option allows some fueling stations to maintain their operations with fewer workers and lets Oregonians, particularly essential workers who must travel, still commute without the uncertainty of not being able to find open gas stations. Unattended self-service is permitted when a gas station owner exhausts all staffing options. Stations that do not have an attendant on duty are still required to post safety signs for physical distancing and instructions showing customers how to operate a fuel pump correctly.</p>

<p>This extension of the self-service rules change has not affected areas of the state that were already authorized for self-service refueling under state law.</p>

<p>Information about the extended rules change for self-service gasoline can be found on the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/osp/programs/sfm/Pages/Self-Service-Rules-Change-FAQs.aspx">OSFM website</a>. </p>

<p><strong>April 24, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>Oregon reports 51 new COVID-19 cases; 3 new deaths; updated model indicates Stay Home, Save Lives is flattening the curve</strong></p>

<p><strong>PORTLAND, Ore. </strong>— COVID-19 has claimed three more lives in Oregon, raising the state’s death toll to 86, the Oregon Health Authority reported at 8 a.m. today.</p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority reported 51 new cases of COVID-19 as of 8 a.m. today bringing the state total to 2,177. The new COVID-19 cases reported today are in the following counties: Clackamas (5), Lane (2), Marion (20), Multnomah (14), Umatilla (2), Washington (8).</p>

<p>During routine data reconciliation, a case originally reported as a Douglas County case was later determined not to be a case. It was subtracted from Thursday's state total, and the total number of cases in Douglas County went down by one to reflect this change.</p>

<p>To provide more case and county-level data, Oregon Health updates its website once a day: <a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 84th COVID-19 death is an 86-year-old man in Multnomah County, who tested positive on April 14 and died April 20 at his residence. He had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 85th COVID-19 death is an 80-year-old man in Multnomah County, who tested positive on April 12 and died April 19 at his residence. He had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 86th COVID-19 death is an 89-year-old man in Linn County, who tested positive on March 15 and died April 22 at his residence. He had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<h1><strong>Updated modeling report shows flattened curve</strong></h1>

<p>OHA also released a <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/YdEkQPkGTSCwbUoagFhH_Oregon-COVID-19-Projections-2020-04-22.pdf">modeling report update</a> today that indicates the efforts of Oregonians to stay home and practice physical distancing has helped prevent as many as 70,000 COVID-19 cases in Oregon.</p>

<p>“The epidemic would have continued to grow exponentially, doubling every week,” the report states. “By April 16th, the number of cumulative infections would have been about 80,000, including 2,000 hospitalizations. Hence, the interventions are estimated to have averted over 70,000 infections, including over 1,500 hospitalizations (450 instead of 2,000), by April 16th.”</p>

<p>“Our modeling continues to show that our collective efforts are working,” said Dean Sidelinger, MD, state epidemiologist. “And despite the very real hardships these sacrifices have cost Oregonians, we have to keep it up even as we move toward easing restrictions. We need to build on our success in limiting the spread of COVID-19.”</p>

<p>OHA has worked with the Institute for Disease Modeling on the weekly reports, which use Oregon outbreak data with IDM research and modeling techniques to present policy makers with projections for the trajectory of the disease. The models are updated weekly.</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133748');">NW Natural Expands Truck Loan Program by Adding High-power, High-mileage Hybrid Truck</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.nwnatural.com" target="_blank">NW Natural</a> - 04/24/20 11:31 AM</span><div id="news133748" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p><em>Second truck added to program runs on CNG and self-charging batteries</em></p>

<p><strong>PORTLAND, Ore.</strong> — NW Natural is expanding its free truck loan program by adding a powerful, high-mileage and low-emission Class 8 truck for long and heavy hauls. The company is adding this new generation of compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid electric technology so fleet operators can experience the vehicle during a short-term, no-cost demo period.</p>

<p>Last fall, NW Natural offered its first Class 8 400 horsepower 12-liter natural gas truck available for loan. Now, the company is offering a natural gas a new hybrid electric vehicle that adds up to an additional 120 horsepower. NW Natural will cover both leasing and fuel costs.</p>

<p>The hybrid system on this truck is provided by Hyllion Inc., a company dedicated to electrification solutions for heavy-duty vehicles. According to Hyllion, the system bolsters the already-existing advantages of natural gas by:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Adding power to manage steep grades and heavy loads.</strong> The E-axle intelligently boosts power by up to 120 horsepower, improving the performance of a 400 horsepower CNG truck to maintain speed on hills and pull loads of 100,000 pounds or more.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Improving fuel economy while benefitting from the low price of natural gas. </strong>The E-axle captures unneeded energy when the vehicle travels downhill or brakes, charging the Hyliion low-weight battery. The system requires no plug-in charging and adds only 800 pounds to the gross weight of the vehicle.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Reducing</strong> <strong>greenhouse gas emissions to zero with Renewable Natural Gas</strong>. By using RNG, net greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced below zero. And RNG is eligible for clean and renewable fuel incentive programs, meaning even lower fuel costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>“By combining electric technology with RNG, companies are saving money while meeting sustainability goals, even for the heavy loads we have in the Pacific Northwest,” said Chris Kroeker, NW Natural product manager of natural gas vehicles. “This truck really combines the best of both worlds and is a unique solution for long-haul fleets.”</p>

<p>Kroeker added that increasingly, RNG is being used in heavy duty vehicle fleets. RNG – methane captured from sources like dairy farms and waste treatment facilities – is an important way to reduce greenhouse gases, so many states and the federal government encourage its production.</p>

<p>Fleet owners in Oregon and Washington can email Kroeker at <a href="mailto:chris.kroeker@nwnatural.com" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">chris.kroeker@nwnatural.com</a> to check on the availability of a three-week trial of the hybrid truck and to learn more about CNG vehicles and RNG programs.</p>

<p><strong>About NW Natural</strong></p>

<p>NW Natural provides natural gas service to approximately 2.5 million people in more than 140 communities through 760,000 meters in Oregon and Southwest Washington with one of the most modern pipeline systems in the nation. It consistently leads the industry with high J.D. Power &amp; Associates customer satisfaction scores. NW Natural is part of Northwest Natural Holding Company, (NYSE: NWN) (NW Natural Holdings), which is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, and owns NW Natural, NW Natural Water Company, and other business interests and activities.</p>

<p><strong>About Hyliion Inc.</strong></p>

<p>Hyliion offers fleets an easy, efficient way to decrease fuel expenses and lower emissions by turning semi-tractors into intelligent electric hybrid vehicles. Hyliion's patented technology can be used on new or existing vehicles. Requiring no driver training, Hyliion provides a positive return to fleets and the environment immediately. Hyliion was among the Top 20 Product Award winners from Heavy Duty Trucking Magazine for its 6X4HE Intelligent Hybrid Electric Truck Solution and RED Herrings's Prestigious Top 100 List.

</div>
<p>Salem, Oregon – In celebration of the uplifting power of art and its value to Oregonians’ quality of life, Governor Kate Brown today announced a call for nominations for the 2020 Governor’s Arts Awards. Established in 1977, the awards are held periodically as funding allows. A call for 2020 nominations is <a href="http://www.oregonartscommission.org/call-nominations-2017-oregon-arts-awards">now posted</a> on the Arts Commission website.</p>

<p>A partnership between the Office of the Governor and the Arts Commission, the Governor’s Arts Awards recognize and honor individuals and organizations that have made significant contributions to the arts in Oregon. Awardees will be honored during an evening Governor’s Arts Awards ceremony on Saturday, Sept. 12, at the Chehalem Cultural Center in Newberg. <strong>Note:</strong> If social distancing prevents a public gathering, the event will be produced as a live-streamed Facebook event by Artslandia.</p>

<p>The 2020 Governor’s Arts Awards are funded in part by The Harold &amp; Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation with generous event support from the Chehalem Cultural Center.</p>

<p>“Art is a fundamental ingredient of any thriving and vibrant community,” Governor Brown said. “Art sparks connections between people, movements, and new ideas. To put it simply, art makes life better. I am thrilled to celebrate Oregon’s best artists and art supporters through the Governor’s Arts Awards.”</p>

<p>The Governor’s Arts Awards are open to any individual, organization or community that currently resides in or has a significant presence in Oregon and has made outstanding contributions to the arts in the state. The 148 past recipients of a Governor’s Arts Award are not eligible (see <a href="http://www.oregonartscommission.org/programs/governors-arts-awards">past recipients</a>).</p>

<p>“The Governor’s Arts Award is the most prestigious honor an Oregon artist can receive,” said Arts Commission Chair Anne Taylor. “We are extremely grateful to Governor Brown for her commitment to formally recognizing the contribution of Oregon artists and arts supporters to our collective quality of life.”</p>

<p>Nominations will be reviewed by a committee comprised of a representative from the Governor’s Office, an Arts Commissioner and three to five arts leaders from across the state. They will recommend three to five awards based on the nominee’s regional, national or international recognition for his/her/their contributions; role in improving the quality of arts experiences and appreciation for the arts in Oregon; contributions to advancing the arts’ positive impact on Oregonians’ quality of life; and length of service to the arts in Oregon. Governor Brown will have final approval of award recipients.</p>

<p>Nominations must be received by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, May 26. Recipients will be notified by July 13 and must be available to participate in the Sept. 12 award ceremony (in person or virtually). The ceremony will be free and open to the public.</p>

<p>The last Governor’s Arts Awards were held in 2017 as part of the celebration of the Arts Commission’s 50th Anniversary.</p>

<p>? ? ? ? ?</p>

<p>The <strong>Oregon Arts Commission </strong>provides leadership, funding and arts programs through its grants, special initiatives and services. Nine commissioners, appointed by the Governor, determine arts needs and establish policies for public support of the arts. The Arts Commission became part of the Oregon Business Development Department in 1993 in recognition of the expanding role the arts play in the broader social, economic and educational arenas of Oregon communities.</p>

<p>The Arts Commission is supported with general funds appropriated by the Oregon legislature, federal funds from the National Endowment for the Arts and funds from the Oregon Cultural Trust.</p>

<p>The <strong>Chehalem Cultural Center </strong>celebrates the arts, community, education, and heritage. The Center is housed in a historic brick building that began its life in 1935 as Central School—a Depression era Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The building is currently owned by the Chehalem Park and Recreation District. Chehalem Cultural Center is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>
               </ul>

<p>Salem – The Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services has extended its emergency order on insurance deadlines. The order requires all insurance companies to extend grace periods for premium payments, postpone policy cancellations and nonrenewals, and extend deadlines for reporting claims.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has caused widespread business closures, job losses, and social distancing measures. This severe disruption to business in the state includes some Oregonians’ ability to make insurance premium payments, report claims, and communicate with their insurance companies.</p>

<p>“Many of our insurers are stepping up in several ways to help their customers through this crisis. We appreciate those that are issuing <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/insure/health/understand/Documents/DFR_AutoInfographic.pdf">auto refunds and credits</a>, providing access to <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/insure/health/understand/Pages/coronavirus.aspx#telehealth">telehealth services</a>, and waiving <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/insure/health/understand/Pages/coronavirus.aspx#healthins">cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing</a>,” said Andrew Stolfi, insurance commissioner. “Extending the emergency order ensures Oregonians can continue to get relief from these insurance policy terms and continue to focus on staying healthy and caring for their families.” </p>

<p>Insurance companies must continue to do the following until the order is no longer in effect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Institute a grace period for premium payments on all insurance policies issued in the state</li>
     <li>Suspend all cancellations and nonrenewals for active insurance policies</li>
     <li>Extend all deadlines for consumers to report claims and communicate about claims</li>
     <li>Provide consumers the ability to make premium payments and report claims while maintaining safe social distancing standards</li>
</ul>
<p>If Oregonians have questions or concerns about their insurance company or agent, they can contact the department’s advocacy team at 888-877-4894 (toll free) or visit <a href="http://www.dfr.oregon.gov/">dfr.oregon.gov</a> for more information or to file a complaint.</p>

<p><strong>April 24, 2020 – Salem, Ore. –</strong> Since the Oregon Lottery has been offering second chance Scratch-it drawings, Amanda Vaughan from Carlton, Washington, has been an advocate, and it paid off when one of her tickets was drawn for a $50,000 prize.</p>

<p>“I have entered a bunch of other types of tickets and never won,” Vaughan said after claiming her prize. “I bought one of the ($5 Roller Derby Crossword) Scratch-its and entered it into the Second Chance and didn’t think much of it, then I got the email!”</p>

<p>Several Oregon Lottery Scratch-its games offer a second chance drawing, where players can enter the numbers of the non-winning tickets into a drawing for an additional top prize of that game. Once sales end for a particular Scratch-it game, there is a drawing for the second chance winner, who is contacted by email and letter.</p>

<p>Vaughan said she has had some extra time with the stay-at-home guidelines and has been entering her old tickets.</p>

<p>"I have been off work and haven’t been checking my email,” she said. “Now I am glad I did! I was expecting spam and got $50,000!”</p>

<p>Vaughan said she was going to purchase a travel trailer with her money, as her sister has some property where the family likes to camp and relax. She said she also likes to spend time camping in the Gorge and in the mountains of Washington state.</p>

<p>“It is going to be put to good use and now I will own it instead of borrowing for it,” she said. “I may even get a better truck to haul it. I’m waiting to see what happens first.”</p>

<p>Vaughan said she is living in Washington until she can get back to work as a bartender after the stay-at-home orders in Oregon and Washington are lifted.</p>

<p>Vaughan was one of several players who last week made appointments to pick up their prizes at the Oregon Lottery’s Salem Headquarters.</p>

<p>To protect the health and safety of its employees and the public, the Oregon Lottery has temporarily closed the Salem and Wilsonville Lottery offices. Officials with the Lottery continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. If players have a winning ticket, they can fill out a claim form on the Oregon Lottery website, <a href="https://oregonlottery.org/about/claim-prizes"></a><a href="https://oregonlottery.org/about/claim-prizes" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://oregonlottery.org/about/claim-prizes</a> , and then mail in the signed ticket and claim form.</p>

<p>Players who have winning tickets of $50,000 or more, can make an appointment to come to the Oregon Lottery office in Salem to claim their prize. Call 503-540-1000 for assistance. As always, players should be certain to sign the back of their tickets.</p>

<p>Since 1985, Oregon Lottery players have won more than $38 billion in prizes.</p>

<p>The Oregon Lottery reminds players to always sign the back of their Lottery tickets, regardless of the game. In the event of winning a jackpot, they should consult with a trusted financial planner or similar professional to develop a plan for their winnings. Prize winners of more than $50,000 are advised to contact the Lottery office and schedule an appointment to claim their prize.</p>

<p><em>Since the Oregon Lottery began selling tickets on April 25, 1985, it has earned more than $12 billion for economic development, public education, Outdoor School, state parks, Veterans services and watershed enhancements.

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133712');">Bigfoot Returns for Wildfire Season</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/SFM/" target="_blank">Oregon State Fire Marshal</a> - 04/24/20 7:30 AM</span><div id="news133712" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>The Oregon Office of State Fire Marshal’s <em>Bigfoot: Believe in Fire Safety</em> campaign is returning for the 2020 wildfire season, asking Oregonians to protect their communities by preventing wildfires.</p>

<p>“This really comes down to protecting communities and preventing wildfires,” says State Fire Marshal Jim Walker, of the OSFM’s Bigfoot campaign. “Wildfire prevention begins with all of us. Together we can make a positive impact. Since most wildfires are started by people, please do your part to prevent them.”</p>

<p>In response to the challenges of recent wildfire seasons, the OSFM enlisted Pacific Northwest icon Bigfoot, friend in fire prevention, to inspire the public to take action and reduce risks of human-caused wildfires.</p>

<p>The campaign first launched in spring 2019. From the start, Bigfoot served as an iconic messenger to encourage Oregonians and visitors to protect our communities and homes from human-caused wildfires.</p>

<p>OSFM’s Fire Prevention Coordinator Stephanie Stafford made the connection that wildfires occur where Bigfoot “lives,” which created the opportunity to promote awareness around fire prevention in the wildland urban interface (WUI). Data show the most costly fires in recent years nationally all occurred on WUI lands.</p>

<p>Wildfire threats to Oregon’s communities have led to longer and costlier fire seasons for state and local agencies. The wildfire problem also has captured the attention of Oregonians. Statewide they see the effects of fires on forests, as well as on homes in the wildland urban interface.</p>

<p>In the past two years, data collected in Oregon for the National Fire Incident Reporting System show there were 14,971 outdoor fires with 554,196 acres burned. Most of these outdoor fires were caused by unintentional human ignition rather than natural sources such as lightning.</p>

<p>The OSFM will be working with its more than 300 Oregon fire service partners to help share Bigfoot-themed education and branding materials that encourage Oregonians to “believe in fire safety,” around their homes and when recreating around their communities and in the outdoors.</p>

<p>The Oregon fire service plays an important role in providing critical first response for initial suppression of many wildfires that begin in their jurisdictions and can often spread to public lands.</p>

<p>In 2019, fire agencies helped Bigfoot reach residents statewide, and the OSFM will be providing Bigfoot materials for agencies to share and motivate their residents to prevent wildfires.</p>

<p>Bigfoot’s message for 2020 to “believe in fire safety” can be shared with the hashtag #BelieveInFireSafety.</p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 23, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.) Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 23, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  The total number of positives in Douglas County remains at twenty-three.  Of the twenty-three, fourteen have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 785 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Two of the twenty-three people that have tested positive are still hospitalized in different hospitals.  Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Fourteen of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Get Tested</strong></p>

<p>If you are having symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, diarrhea, sore throat or decreased sense of smell and taste, talk to your health care provider about being tested for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Given the growing availability of commercial labs and the improving availability of testing supplies and PPE DPHN has revised their guidelines to providers on testing. DPHN has sent out communications to the local health care community alerting them of the increased availability of testing for their patients.  DPHN also announced yesterday that Quest labs is now offering the IgG antibody test for COVID-19 locally. Testing without a provider order is not yet available.  The next drive through COVID-19 clinic, led by DPHN, will happen tomorrow, Friday April 24, in Roseburg.</p>

<p>“<em>We will continue to offer the nasal swab test for acute infection of COVID-19 in our drive-through clinics.  Antibody testing is also now available locally through a blood draw at a Quest Lab.  Both tests must still be ordered by your provider but we are encouraging people to get tested as we now have increased availability of testing supplies and PPE. It is important to have your provider order the tests, just like any other diagnostic test such as cholesterol, so that your provider can give you follow up medical care if needed.  Your primary care provider is a partner in your health and wellness, especially when diagnosing and providing treatment for COVID-19”</em> -Dr. Bob Dannenhoffer, Public Health Officer for Douglas County</p>

<p><strong>Oregon COVID-19 Case Update</strong></p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority reports new cases once a day on its website at <a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.  The Oregon Health Authority is also releasing the daily situation status report, which is produced jointly with Oregon Office of Emergency Management.

<p><a name="_Hlk38272665"><strong>Elective Medical Procedures Can Resume May 1</strong></a></p>

<p>Non-urgent medical procedures, which had been on hold in Oregon for the past month due to COVID-19, can resume starting May 1, the governor announced today.   The governor issued an executive order exactly one month ago today, on March 23, suspending all elective, non-urgent medical procedures requiring the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to preserve PPE and hospital capacity for a potential surge in COVID-19 patients.   At a news conference this morning, the governor announced that hospitals, surgical centers, medical offices and dental offices will be able to resume such procedures on May 1, as long as they can demonstrate that they have met new requirements for COVID-19 safety and preparedness.  As examples of the types of procedures that have been on hold, Dr. Dana Hargunani of the Oregon Health Authority mentioned hip replacements, sinus surgeries and certain biopsies.</p>

<p>“These kinds of deferred procedures have added to the suffering COVID-19 has imposed on Oregonians,” she said. “While indirect, the toll has been real. We also recognize that the cancellation of elective procedures has undercut the financial stability of the health care system we depend on as our front-line defense against the virus. It is now appropriate that we begin to let these procedures move forward – but slowly, safely and with caution.”</p>

<p>The governor noted that when the order was issued a month ago, there was great concern about a state and national supply shortage. Now that Oregon appears to have adequate hospital capacity and PPE supply to manage COVID-19 at current need levels, the restriction is being lifted. Health care providers must demonstrate they meet the criteria for COVID-19 preparedness before they resume non-urgent procedures, including that they have the ability to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission to patients and staff</li>
     <li>Maintain adequate hospital capacity in the event of a virus resurgence</li>
     <li>Have adequate PPE on hand to protect workers</li>
</ul>
<p>Facilities that are ready to resume elective procedures will do so gradually. They must start at a maximum of 50 percent of their “pre-COVID volume,” Hargunani said. She noted that future suspensions of elective procedures are still possible, should there be a COVID-19 resurgence.</p>

<p>“By staying home, Oregonians have saved lives,” Hargunani said. “This is one small step toward reopening in our state, and it’s only possible because of all the work we’ve done together to contain COVID-19.”</p>

<p>The governor thanked medical, dental and veterinary offices that have donated PPE to hospitals. Non-urgent procedures at veterinary offices were halted under a separate order, and those restrictions have not yet been lifted.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping Kids and Teens Safe Online </strong></p>

<p>Children and teens may be spending more time online than they usually do due to the current stay-at-home guidelines related to COVID-19. Here are some tips from Oregon Health Authority on keeping your kids safe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talk to them about online safety, even if you’ve done so previously.</li>
     <li>Monitor their online activities and know their passwords. Maintain an open line of communication.</li>
     <li>Review privacy settings on social networks and websites that your children frequent. Use those privacy settings to limit who can view their profile.</li>
     <li>Minimize the amount of publicly available personal information such as phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, birth dates and other identifying info. Help your kids understand what information is OK and what should never be shared.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional tips and resources can be found on the websites of the <a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer-protection/phone-internet-tv/online-safety/">Oregon Department of Justice</a>, the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/ncmecresources.aspx">Oregon Department of Education</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dfinow.org/">Digital Futures Initiative</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Video Calls Offer Support for Essential Workers</strong></p>

<p>The nonprofit <a href="https://www.linesforlife.org/">Lines for Life</a> has begun hosting Zoom calls three times a week to give essential workers a place to talk to each other and share their stories. The calls are known as the “Virtual Wellness Room,” and are held every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 12:30 to 1:00 pm.  Anyone considered an essential worker during the COVID-19 pandemic is welcome to participate, including first responders, mental health professionals, social workers, “helpers,” and others. Here is the <a href="https://zoom.us/j/4848426773">link</a> to participate. Calls will be guided by a facilitator.</p>

<p>“We are offering a place for helpers to exchange stories of hope and areas of need,” Lines for Life officials said. “We especially want to hear what things are coming up for you personally and explore how we can cheer one another on to continue the good work you are already doing.”</p>

<p>Separately, a coalition of local health care providers has set up a Douglas County Healthcare Worker Support Line that went live this week. Local health care workers can access this service by calling (541) 677-5800. The line is available Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. A <a href="https://adaptoregon.org/cmhr/">website</a> has also been set up that contains additional resources for protecting medical workers’ mental and emotional health.</p>

<p><strong>Red Cross Prepares for Wildfire Season</strong></p>

<p>While COVID-19 has been at the top of everyone’s priority list in recent weeks, the Red Cross Cascades Region is also working behind the scenes to prepare for the upcoming wildfire season.</p>

<p>“With health and safety at the forefront, the Red Cross strives to maintain the well-being of our workforce as we deliver our mission of alleviating human suffering in communities affected by disasters,” Red Cross officials said. “Delivering hope, comfort and support is at the core of what we do, and COVID-19 will not change the mission of the Red Cross, but it will impact the way we carry it out.”</p>

<p>One area of focus is ensuring that there are clean, safe temporary shelter options for people in the event of a wildfire – especially non-congregate shelter options such as hotels, motels and campgrounds. When congregate shelter is the only option available, the Red Cross will work with the local health authority to set it up in accordance with health and safety guidelines.  Efforts will be made to secure pet-friendly facilities, but the Red Cross relies on community partners to manage housing/support for any household pets displaced with their owners. Service animals are always welcome in Red Cross shelters.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Tips: Game Night Thursday </strong></p>

<p>Bingo doesn’t have to be just for retirement homes; consider getting creative with it! If you have a computer and a printer, you can create custom Bingo sheets for your family. If you’re about to watch “Frozen 2,” for example, create a variety of “Frozen”-themed Bingo sheets; when someone says “Elsa,” “Olaf,” or “Kristoff,” mark off a square. Are you an adult having a Zoom happy hour with friends? You can create Bingo sheets for that, too; if someone’s dog barks or child interrupts, mark off a square. Of course, regular Bingo is fun too, and there are many websites that offer free, printable Bingo cards. Actor Matthew McConaughey had a blast when he played virtual Bingo with a group of seniors in Austin, Texas, recently – watch the video <a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/matthew-mcconaughey-cheers-nursing-home-residents-with-virtual-bingo/">here</a>.</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133727');">California Con Man Returns to Prison for Running New Fraud Scheme While on Supervised Release</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-or" target="_blank">U.S. Attorney's Office - District of Oregon</a> - 04/23/20 3:26 PM</span><div id="news133727" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>PORTLAND, Ore.—Bryan Scott Gunn, 45, of Victorville, California, was sentenced today to 63 months in federal prison and three years’ supervised release for orchestrating a fraud scheme that netted more than $344,000 from unknowing victims while he was on federal supervised release.</p>

<p>According to court documents, less than two weeks after completing a 22-month federal prison sentence for a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/california-man-sentenced-defrauding-portland-area-investors-out-almost-1-million">similar fraud scheme</a>, Gunn registered a new fictitious company called Legacy Funding Group. According to a website Gunn created, Legacy Funding Group was a financing company “with access to many private banking institutions and other professional relationships” that “specialized in structured asset based financing and equipment leasing.”</p>

<p>Gunn went to great lengths to make Legacy Funding Group appear legitimate, opening corresponding bank accounts, registering email addresses, falsely claiming to lease high-end commercial office space, and attempting to disassociate his true identity from the company. His scheme worked. In a matter of months, Gunn had successfully cheated 11 clients out of more than $344,000. Gunn convinced his victims, many of whom were in agriculture or agriculture-related industries, to pay him various upfront costs in order to obtain promised financing or loans.</p>

<p>Once he received his clients’ money, Gunn moved it between several bank accounts using cash, cashier’s checks, and temporary checks. His cash withdrawals alone exceeded $100,000. When his clients complained about the lack of financing and demanded their money be returned, Gunn referred them via email to a fictitious legal department. In the end, Gunn did not obtain any financing or loans for his clients and diverted all of their money to personal use.</p>

<p>During sentencing, U.S. District Court Judge Michael W. Mosman ordered Gunn to pay $363,453 in restitution to his victims.</p>

<p>On February 24, 2020, Gunn pleaded guilty to one count each of wire fraud and money laundering.</p>

<p>The case was investigated by IRS-Criminal Investigation and prosecuted by Scott E. Bradford, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.</p>

<p>At the end of March, we let everyone know about the Community Outreach and Mental Health Enhancement Team (COMET), which is a partnership between Lincoln County Behavioral Health and the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office. In that release we discussed how Behavioral Health Clinical Counselor Liz Scott-Wedler and Sheriff’s Deputy Siscilee Gouge have teamed up to provide outreach to the Lincoln County population suffering from mental illness. Though COMET has only been in full operation for about the last four weeks, the team has started off at a sprint.</p>

<p>COMET has made hundreds of contacts with individuals and organizations. They’ve been able to act as a liaison group between governmental, non-profit, and community organizations to streamline services and help prevent the duplication of effort.</p>

<p>Deputy Gouge said, “Organizations sometimes don’t realize who is doing what for a person. In some cases, several places are all doing the same thing and trying to get a client set up with the same services. In other cases, two organizations are thinking a client is receiving help from the other and not connecting them with what they need. What we’ve found is that everybody is out there to help. They just need assistance getting on the same page sometimes, because we interact with a population who occasionally has trouble communicating that.”</p>

<p>Devin Whitaker from Lincoln County Veteran Services wrote, “I just wanted to write and express my appreciation for the efforts of Liz Scott-Wedler and Siscilee Gouge for identifying a veteran in need and working so hard at getting us all connected for the benefit of that veteran.”</p>

<p>Making those connections has paid off. COMET has found housing for several people- one of them homeless for eight years- in either permanent or transitional capacities. In other cases, COMET has improved the safety of their clients. One law enforcement officer wrote that COMET intervention “…probably kept this from becoming a very dangerous, possibly deadly encounter.”</p>

<p>COMET has several clients they check in with on a regular basis. Whether daily or weekly, they reach out and touch base with people who were frequent users of services. In one case, a person went from averaging 10 law enforcement contacts per week to only having regular “check-ins” with COMET.</p>

<p>Sheriff Curtis Landers said, “I am extremely pleased with the progress COMET has made so quickly. We knew it was the right thing to do and would help individuals, but I didn’t realize it would achieve such rapid success.  This is a testament to the great work and innovation Liz and Siscilee bring to the program.”</p>

<p>This is all in four weeks. The results speak for themselves: COMET provides a service that was desperately needed in Lincoln County.</p>

<p>Becky Hultberg, OAHHS President &amp; CEO, issued the following statement on Governor Brown’s decision to lift her order to delay non-urgent medical procedures in hospitals, surgical centers, medical offices, and dental offices. Scheduled procedures at facilities that show they’ve met the guidelines on COVID-19 safety and preparedness will resume May 1.</p>

<p>“Today the Governor announced a framework for the reopening of hospital elective procedures, effective May 1. This has been a top priority for members, and we appreciate that the Governor prioritized this important work.</p>

<p>We supported the decision to pause elective procedures to preserve PPE for the COVID-19 fight, but we also understand that it’s not safe to delay some of these procedures indefinitely. Our patients need care and we are prepared to safely resume health care services.</p>

<p>We are currently reviewing the framework to determine how hospitals can best meet the conditions outlined and will provide feedback to the Governor and Oregon Health Authority. We greatly appreciate the work of the Governor’s Medical Advisory Panel and the Governor’s commitment to getting hospitals back to normal operations.</p>

<p>Finally, we are encouraged that Governor Brown pledged to create a Hospital Stabilization Fund to bring vital assistance to hospitals, in response to our request for $200 million in state support. Many hospitals are the largest employers in their communities and their continued financial health is essential both to the COVID-19 fight and the long term health of the communities they serve.”</p>

<p>Media Hotline: 800-570-5838</p>

<p><strong>Pacific Power crews and contractors continue essential work</strong></p>

<p>Inspection and vegetation crews may need to access customer property as they work to deliver safe, reliable electricity during COVID-19 stay-at-home period</p>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (April 23, 2020) — Practicing social distancing and wearing personal protective gear, Pacific Power field crews and contractors are at work maintaining and protecting the electric grid throughout the Pacific Northwest to serve our customers.</p>

<p>To accommodate customers during this time, routine maintenance schedules have been modified to minimize any work that could cause large service interruptions. Field employees and contractors are also clearing trees and plants away from poles and lines as part of the utility’s ongoing wildfire safety plan. Often this work is on or near customer property and could require conversations with customers. While routine in normal times, these contacts are sometimes challenging now as customers are concerned about unknown persons working close to their homes.</p>

<p>If there are ever any questions or concerns about utility-related work happening in your area, please call Pacific Power at (888) 221-7070 to confirm that the work is authorized. Crews and contractors working for Pacific Power should be wearing appropriate safety gear, show identification when asked and typically be driving easily identified vehicles. Providing safe and unobstructed access to company equipment such as poles, wires and meters is required for receiving electric service from Pacific Power.</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate, but there have been instances in the last few weeks where property owners have threatened employees and contractors working for Pacific Power,” said David Lucas, vice president of operations. “We understand the increased concern many are feeling due to these uncertain times, but the work we are doing is essential to maintaining local power systems. We would not be there if that wasn’t the case. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions about the individuals working on or near your property.”</p>

<p>During inspections, facility inspectors and vegetation crews examine miles of lines each day to determine where potential maintenance and trimming is required. Therefore, we may not be able to notify customers when some of this work takes place.</p>

<p>For questions or concerns, our customer service professionals are here to help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us toll free at (888) 221-7070. # # #</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133705');">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Initial Claims and Additional Unemployment Benefits in Oregon</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.employment.oregon.gov" target="_blank">Oregon Employment Department</a> - 04/23/20 10:15 AM</span><div id="news133705" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>During the week of April 12 to April 18, the Oregon Employment Department received 36,700 initial claims for unemployment benefits. Since public health measures began the week starting March 15, Oregon has received about 333,700 initial claims for unemployment insurance.</p>

<p><strong>Helping Oregonians</strong></p>

<p>The Employment Department continues processing initial and ongoing unemployment benefits claims at a record pace, resulting in $119 million in benefits paid to Oregonians during the week of April 12 to April 18. The agency continues expanding capacity for taking claims, with 520 employees now dedicated to taking unemployment claims, and additional contact center facility planning underway.</p>

<p>Employment Department efforts also continue toward launching the <a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/ui-benefits/CARES">Pandemic Unemployment Assistance</a> (PUA) program. Once open, the PUA program will provide the self-employed, contract workers, and gig workers not already eligible, along with those not usually eligible due to too few hours or earnings, and those who were going to start work but could not, with benefits never before available. Programming, testing, and staff training for the PUA program are in progress. Upon successful testing, the Employment Department expects to open the program for applications by the end of April.</p>

<p>Additional information, program updates, and metrics related to the Employment Department’s ongoing response to the unprecedented need for unemployment benefits can be found on the interactive dashboard of the agency’s <a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/ORUnemployment_COVID19">COVID-19 page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Claims</strong></p>

<p>The Employment Department has detailed information for 31,700 of the initial claims processed during the week of April 12 to April 18. The greatest number of initial claims continued to come from the leisure and hospitality sector (8,000), which includes hotels and restaurants. This reflects ongoing impacts of public health and safety measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the week of March 15 to March 21, there have been about 60,800 initial claims filed from leisure and hospitality.</p>

<p>Other sectors with the largest initial claims totals for the past five weeks include health care and social assistance (30,900) and retail trade (24,300). Every sector of the economy has seen increased claims activity though. Initial claims totaled 16,500 in professional and business services, and 18,200 in manufacturing since the week of March 15 to March 21.</p>

<p>Multnomah (6,800), Washington (4,000), and Lane (2,900) counties had the largest number of claims during the week of April 12 to April 18. These three counties have consistently had the largest number of initial claims in recent weeks. More initial claims data by industry and area can be found on the QualityInfo.org <a href="https://www.qualityinfo.org/covid-19">COVID-19 page</a>.</p>

               <p><strong>Stay home. Save lives.</strong></p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>

<p>[<strong>Beaverton, Ore., April 23, 2020</strong>] – In response to social isolation mandates, Parkinson’s Resources of Oregon (PRO), a local non-profit organization that delivers support to people living with Parkinson’s disease, has deployed a robust phone outreach program to reach those living in isolation with Parkinson’s.  “We’ve conducted nearly 500 phone calls, facilitated tele-support programs serving hundreds of clients, and also pivoted our programs which include classes, educational opportunities and support groups to a virtual model,” explains Parkinson’s Resources of Oregon executive director, Holly Chaimov. “Our greatest concern is loneliness and depression among our already isolated seniors. Keeping clients moving and socially connected helps slow the progression of their disease.”</p>

<p>PRO serves approximately 13,000 households in Oregon and SW Washington affected by Parkinson’s disease and that number grows by 100 new households every month. Senior Parkinson’s patients with cognitive impairment, or limited access to or comfort with technology, require health and human service providers to rethink barriers to support services.</p>

<p>Neurologists working with senior Parkinson’s patients have adapted clinical services with a similar approach. “After converting all follow up visits to telephone visits, we have been able to evaluate symptoms and adjust medications for existing patients. Patients have not only accepted this approach, they have expressed great appreciation for continued access to neurologic care,” said Joseph Quinn, M.D., OHSU Professor of Neurology, Parkinson's Center Director, and PRO Board Member. “We are moving to telemedicine visits, but some of our older patients are not tech-savvy so we will continue telephone care for them, as every indication is that it is effective and re-assuring to patients.”</p>

<p><strong>Going back to basics.</strong> “We have clients asking for VHS tapes, so that they can participate in our exercise classes,” Holly Chaimov shares. “Another client informed me she’s been eating peanut butter and applesauce because she was fearful of going to the grocery store but didn’t want to be a burden on anyone. There is also a sense of relief when someone is calling and checking in on them, even if the basics are covered. Right now, it’s the safest and most effective way for us to gauge the needs and mental health of many of our senior clients who don’t have email or access to the internet.”</p>

<p>Dr. Laurie Mischley, a leading researcher in the area of complementary care and wellness in Parkinson's disease, found that loneliness is the single biggest predictor of progression for people with Parkinson's disease. <a href="https://www.davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/you-cant-exercise-your-way-out-of-poor-social-connections/"></a><a href="https://www.davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/you-cant-exercise-your-way-out-of-poor-social-connections/" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://www.davisphinneyfoundation.org/blog/you-cant-exercise-your-way-out-of-poor-social-connections/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>About Parkinson’s Disease:</strong></p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the level of dopamine produced by the brain, affecting executive functioning and movement. A common symptom of Parkinson’s disease is depression, which manifests in the form of anxiety, apathy and a feeling of extreme isolation. Depression is often left untreated in people with Parkinson’s disease. The mental health aspects of Parkinson’s remain a primary concern of our clients during this time of social isolation as stress can exacerbate and even speed up the progression of this disease. Research consistently shows that Parkinson's is a disease that has to be actively managed, not just by taking medications, but by exercising and maintaining social connection.</p>

<p>Every nine minutes someone is diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the U.S. About 1 million people are currently living with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. Doctors diagnose about 60,000 cases a year, mostly in people over age 60.</p>

<p><strong>About Parkinson’s Resources:</strong></p>

<p>Parkinson’s Resources of Oregon (PRO) is a donor supported non-profit with the sole mission of advancing the quality of life for people with Parkinson’s, their families and caregivers. With three locations, hundreds of volunteers and dedicated leadership, PRO provides direct care and support of thousands of families. Working to address issues faced by Parkinson’s patients and their families, we can significantly improve the quality of life for all touched by this disease.</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133703');">Auto insurance refunds, credits, and extended coverage coming to Oregonians</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.dcbs.oregon.gov" target="_blank">Oregon Dept. of Consumer &amp; Business Services</a> - 04/23/20 9:01 AM</span><div id="news133703" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>Salem – Several auto insurance companies have been working with the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation to provide auto insurance premium refunds and credits to Oregonians.</p>

<p>The refunds and credits are due to the reduced risk of auto accidents because of Gov. Kate Brown’s Stay Home, Save Lives executive order. The division encourages all carriers to consider providing refunds that reflect the reduced risk of auto liabilities due to the emergency order. This includes taking steps to reclassify vehicle usage, and properly adjusting any mileage-based policy metrics.</p>

<p>Last week, the division provided guidance to insurance carriers for issuing the refunds to help process the filings and get money to consumers as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/insure/health/understand/Documents/DFR_AutoInfographic.pdf">list of the insurance companies</a> that have committed to provide refunds and credits to Oregon customers.</p>

<p>“Thank you to the insurance companies that have stepped up to provide these refunds to their customers,” said Andrew Stolfi, Oregon insurance commissioner. “Our division is proud to help insurance companies provide this much needed relief to Oregonians.”</p>

<p>In addition to the premium refunds, the division has asked all insurers to provide temporary private passenger auto insurance coverage for drivers delivering food, prescriptions, and other products for their employers.</p>

<p>“The coronavirus has forced many businesses to rely on delivery services as a primary source of income. This has created an urgent need for insured delivery drivers,” said Stolfi. “Providing this coverage helps employers maintain essential income and keeps many of their employees working.”</p>

<p>Consumers who have insurance or financial services questions related to COVID-19 can visit the division’s <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/insure/health/understand/Pages/coronavirus.aspx">COVID-19 page</a>.</p>

<p>If you have questions about your auto insurance premium refund or about your insurance coverage, contact your insurance company.</p>

<p>If you have issues with an insurance company or agent, contact the division’s advocacy team one of three ways:</p>

<p>An Oregon dairy was among the winners of the 2020 U.S. Dairy Sustainability Awards announced yesterday in a presentation by the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy. Threemile Canyon Farms in Boardman, Oregon, was one of three dairies nationwide – and the only one on the U.S. West Coast – to receive the award for Outstanding Dairy Sustainability.</p>

<p>Threemile Canyon Farms was recognized for demonstrating how growing crops and milking cows can complement one another in a regenerative, closed-loop system (<a href="http://www.threemilecanyonfarms.com/sustainability/closed-loop-system"></a><a href="http://www.threemilecanyonfarms.com/sustainability/closed-loop-system" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.threemilecanyonfarms.com/sustainability/closed-loop-system</a>), resulting in little to no waste. “We find what traditionally would be considered waste and redeploy that waste to beneficial use,” said Marty Myers, general manager and part owner for Threemile Canyon Farms.</p>

<p>For the past nine years, the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy has recognized dairy farms, businesses and partnerships whose practices improve the well-being of people, animals and the planet. Selection involves a rigorous nomination and review process, and the winners serve as a replicable model for best practices that yield economic, environmental and social benefits.</p>

<p>Threemile’s 70,000 Jersey cows are located at the center of the 93,000-acre farm. Practicing precision agriculture, the farm also grows organic blueberries, onions, carrots, potatoes, and corn, as well as a variety of conventional food, feed, and cover crops. Manure from the dairy serves as organic fertilizer for the crops, and the cows consume byproducts from food processing for human consumption that would otherwise go to waste.</p>

<p>Modeling creativity, innovation, and efficiency, their efforts to continuously improve farm practices generate positive results for food safety, air and water quality, animal care, and community benefits. “Our philosophy and approach is continuous improvement, with our team members bringing new ideas to our operations in farming, livestock, and renewable energy,” said Myers.</p>

<p>As an example, Threemile recently partnered with Equilibrium Capital to invest in converting its methane digester from generating electricity to producing clean Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). This process sequesters about 136,000 metric tons of carbon emissions every year. This is the annual equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions from 28,875 passenger vehicles driven while yielding a beneficial product in the form of RNG. Renewable natural gas used in vehicles reduces fuel emissions by 80 percent or more compared to diesel fuel.</p>

<p>The farm also thinks beyond its borders, voluntarily placing 23,000 acres into a wildlife conservation area and donating 7,000 pounds of ground beef to Farmers Ending Hunger every month. It also supports internships and opportunities for local 4-H and FFA students and other local community projects.</p>

<p>This year’s U.S. Dairy Sustainability Award winners show how operations of all scope and size are doing their part to make a positive impact on Earth’s resources. Go to <a href="http://www.usdairy.com/sustainability">usdairy.com/sustainability</a> to learn more about the winners and to see how U.S. dairy adopts conservation practices in sensitive ecosystems, recycles water, produces clean energy and more.</p>

<p>“Threemile Canyon Farms is a highly successful working model of how modern dairy practices can be an environmental solution,” said Oregon Dairy and Nutrition Council Executive Director Pete Kent. “To feed not only our own local communities, but growing global populations, we must embrace such efforts as these to care for our natural resources, so we can rely on them continuously to produce our food in the decades ahead.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Oregon was the first state to begin conducting elections entirely by mail,” said Lane County Clerk Cheryl Betschart. “That means we will be able to move forward with the May 19 Primary Election and Oregon voters can cast their ballots from the safety of their own homes.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Registration options include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Online at <a href="http://www.oregonvotes.gov" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.oregonvotes.gov</a> no later than 11:59 p.m., Tuesday, April 28. The online option is available to those with a valid Oregon driver’s license, DMV-issued identification card or learner’s permit.</li>

     <li>Mail a voter registration card to the Elections Office postmarked no later than Tuesday, April 28.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p>The Lincoln Street ballot drop box at Lane County Elections will be open through Tuesday, April 28, at 5:00 p.m. to make it easier for voters to drop off completed registration cards.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>New voters who will turn 18 on or before the May 19 Election Day may register by the April 28 deadline and receive a ballot, even if they are still 17 on the deadline date.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>Primary elections are held so the members of a party can choose the party’s candidates for office. The 40+ percent of Oregonians registered as not affiliated with a political party, or registered with a minor party (Constitution, Independent, Libertarian, Pacific Green, Progressive, Working Families) will receive a ballot that includes only nonpartisan offices.  </em></p>

<p> BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR STIMULUS RELIEF RELATED SCAMS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We know there’s been a flood of information and updates about the government’s economic impact payments, or so-called stimulus checks, lately. But quickly and safely moving massive amounts of money into the hands of those who need it is a big job with a lot of moving parts.</p>

<p>We also know that the more you know about the process, the less likely you’re going to be tripped up by calls, text messages, or emails from scammers trying to steal your money or personal information.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need to know about the stimulus payments and how to avoid scams related to these payments.</p>

<p><strong>Who will get money?</strong></p>

<p>Adult U.S. residents that meet established <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center">income limits</a> are eligible to receive money from the government. This includes:</p>

<p><strong>Taxpayers</strong> – people who filed a federal tax return for 2018 or 2019.<strong>Retirees</strong> – people who get Social Security, Railroad, or other retirement benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Beneficiaries</strong> – people who get public benefits like SSDI, disability, or veterans’ benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Non-filers</strong> – people who do not have to file a federal tax return, including people who made no income or made less than $12,200 (or $24,400 for married couples).</p>

<p><strong>What to do</strong></p>

<p>Most people don’t have to do anything to get their money because the IRS will use the same payment method – direct deposit, Direct Express debit card, or paper check – used to send you your tax refund, Social Security, retirement, or other government benefits money. If the IRS doesn’t have your direct deposit information, you can go to the “Get My Payment” feature at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments">irs.gov/coronavirus</a> and let them know where to send your direct deposit.</p>

<p>If you don’t usually file a tax return, go to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments">irs.gov/coronavirus</a> to access the “Non-filer” portal and to figure out what, if anything, you have to do to claim your money.</p>

<p>To check on the status of your payment, you can now use the “Get My Payment” feature at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments">irs.gov/coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Coronavirus stimulus payment scams</strong></p>

<p>Scammers are using these stimulus payments to try to rip people off. They might try to get you to pay a fee to get your stimulus payment. Or they might try to convince you to give them your Social Security number, bank account, or government benefits debit card account number.</p>

<p><strong>4 tips for avoiding a Coronavirus stimulus payment scam</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Only use <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments">irs.gov/coronavirus</a> to submit information to the IRS – and never in response to a call, text, or email.</li>
     <li>The IRS won’t contact you by phone, email, text message, or social media with information about your stimulus payment, or to ask you for your Social Security number, bank account, or government benefits debit card account number. Anyone who does is a <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams">scammer phishing for your information</a>.</li>
     <li>You don’t have to pay to get your stimulus money.</li>
     <li>The IRS won’t tell you to deposit your stimulus check then send them money back because they paid you more than they owed you. That’s a <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams">fake check scam</a>.</li>

<p>Lebanon Firefighters responded late Wednesday evening to a reported structure fire in the 3000 block of Berlin Road. Initial dispatch information told responding units that a trailer was on fire with vehicles in the driveway. On arrival of the first due engine, a report was given of a fully involved fifth wheel trailer fire with several trees as exposures. Due to the rural location of the fire, firefighters laid 300 feet of hose from the roadway to the fire and set up for nurse tender operations.</p>

<p>The first due Engine Lieutenant assumed Incident Command and deemed the blaze a defensive fire due to its involvement. No one was injured in the blaze, but one resident of the property was evaluated. The only victim of the fire was the owner of the trailer’s dog who did not escape the blaze. The fire was under control within 20 minutes and crews remained on scene approximately another hour to cool hot spots on trees and in the trailer. The cause of the fire is undetermined at this time but does not appear suspicious.</p>

<p>The Lebanon Fire District responded with 12 personnel on 2 Engines, 2 Water-Tenders and 1 ALS Medic unit as well as 2 Chief officers. Albany Fire Department assisted Lebanon by responding an Engine and 2 ALS Medic units to help cover the City of Lebanon during the incident.  </p>
