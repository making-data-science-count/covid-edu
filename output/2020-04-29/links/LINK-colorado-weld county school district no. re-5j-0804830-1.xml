<p>
Dear Weld RE-5J Parents and Community,</p>
<p>
I am hoping that you had some time to get out in this wonderful weather this weekend!  I appreciate all that you have done to support our teachers and staff members during this transition from in-person learning to Cloud School.  I know it has not been easy but we all respect what you have tried to do to explain this crazy situation to your children and to get them interested in a new way of learning.  I have a couple of updates I would like to share with you today that I am hoping will assist you if your child is starting to show fatigue with online learning.  </p>
<p>
We are in the final stretch of our school spring calendar and the Weld RE-5J team would like to encourage your child(ren) to <strong>#FINISHSTRONG</strong> and re-engage/continue to engage with Cloud School!  We are offering some incentives for our students in PreK-11th grade to end this school year on a positive, strong note.  This week, each teacher will be communicating the expectations for Cloud School for the month of May around engagement by the student, participation in the Cloud School classes, completing assignments, etc.  During the week of May 18th, the teachers will be sending out to parents a link to the incentive page so that each parent can fill out a form to receive this FREE T-shirt for their child (which is the key to the rest of the incentives next fall).<br><strong><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/resize/imageattachments/wysiwyg/quarintine_shirt-400x220.png" style="width: 400px; height: 220px;" width="400" height="220"></strong></p>
<p>This nomination by your child's teacher(s) and the free t-shirt will open up other incentives for our students once we are back in school this fall.  Each school is planning different events (assemblies, pep rallys, dances, lunch parties, sporting events, recognitions on social media and websites, etc.) that only our students who received these t-shirts will be able to participate in later on.  It will be important for your child to engage now so that recognitions, celebrations, and special events are opened up to him/her this summer and fall!  Expect to hear what the qualifications are from each of your child's teachers by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Since we cannot mandate this online learning experience currently, we are hoping that we can assist you in getting your child to <strong>#FINISHSTRONG</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Summer Cloud School:</strong></p>
<p>We will be offering summer Cloud School FREE for ANY child currently in grades PreK-11th (not including KQA).  All the details have not been worked out yet but we need to see how many parents would be interested in their child attending summer Cloud School.  </p>
<p>Please fill out this interest form for Summer Cloud School:  <a href="https://forms.gle/iyxu4UU6vv96zDhf8">https://forms.gle/iyxu4UU6vv96zDhf8</a></p>
<p><strong>Lunches will continue through June 30th!</strong></p>
<p>We have been approved to continue serving our lunch/breakfasts each day Monday-Friday through June 30th! The schedule will remain the same with lunch pickups at Milliken Elementary School and Roosevelt High School from 11am-noon each day and our bus drive-throughs to neighborhoods.  We are applying to extend this for the entire summer but for right now, we will continue our lunch delivery.  Please send every child in our community, ages 1-18 to pick up a lunch each day!</p>
<p><strong>May 1st:  No Cloud School</strong></p>
<p>May 1st is our professional development day for staff.  There will be no Cloud School this day.</p>
<p><strong>Board of Education Worksession on April 29th at 11:00 am</strong></p>
<p>Our Board of Education will be discussing the potential bond and mill levy override for this November this Wednesday at 11am.  You can tune in via LiveStream (posted on our FaceBook page and website that day).</p>
<p><strong>RHS Graduation and Senior Appreciation!</strong></p>
<p>We have a great group of parents and RHS administration who are currently discussing and planning what graduation will look like.  They are also planning other events for our graduating seniors!  I will keep you posted once these plans are finalized.  </p>
<p>Finally, I shared this with my staff last week and I hope that it will resonate with some of you as well.  </p>
<p>This came through my email today and I thought I would share.  It's from the Random Acts of Kindness team.  When I heard Chris Peterson's definition of resilience, I could only think of <strong>ALL OF YOU</strong>.  His definition of resilience is the ability to "struggle well".  <strong>You have all "struggled well" these last few weeks.</strong>  Only five more to go.  Enjoy this weekend.  Turn off the emails and the computer.  Do something fun.  <strong>You got this:</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are all doing our best. Whether that’s keeping up with work demands while at home, educating our kids while they are out of school, caring for others ‘virtually’ or simply taking care of more responsibilities while trying to create a ‘new normal’ in a time of uncertainty. <u><em>You are doing a great job.</em></u></strong></p>
<p>You’ve heard the word resilience, but maybe you’ve never really thought about what it means. Chris Peterson, one of the founders of Positive Psychology, said it best when he described resilience as the ability to ‘struggle well’. We are more apt to thrive when we embrace the life lessons in our challenges, examining with curiosity, the patterns in our struggles. We can cope...with hope.</p>
<p><strong>This is a time to do a few things we normally don’t prioritize:</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>REFLECT</u></strong><br>
Use this time to reflect on what you’re doing well. It may not feel like you’re having many successes each day. You may feel lost or hopeless at times. But, if you spend some time each day reflecting on the small victories (completing a task for work or getting a load of laundry done) you’ll find that you’re making it work.</p>
<p><strong><u>BE GRATEFUL</u></strong><br>
Aside from celebrating the small accomplishments, recognize things for which to be grateful. Do you have food in the refrigerator? Are you healthy? Can you connect with your family and friends via phone or computer? Did you smile at least once today?</p>
<p><strong><u>COMMIT TO SELF-CARE</u></strong><br>
Self-care doesn’t mean you should take a bubble bath or get a massage. It means you should do the things that bring you joy and give you energy. Do you like to cook? Enjoy exercising? Play an instrument? You may find there is more time for you to focus on things you’re passionate about or start something new.</p>
<p><strong><u>BE PRODUCTIVE</u></strong><br>
Even though you may not be accomplishing all the things on your ‘to do’ list, make sure you’re getting done what you can so you can feel a sense of purpose each day. Don’t push yourself (see the second point in self-care), but try to set realistic expectations of yourself.</p>
<p><strong><u>GIVE GRACE</u></strong><br>
The main thing to keep in mind during all of this—give yourself a break. You are doing the best you can with the situation at hand and putting pressure on yourself to ‘do better’ can make challenging times even more difficult. And, make sure to give grace to those who may be having a hard time being productive while juggling various challenges of their own. Everyone manages stress differently. None of us know what the other person is going through, so be kind.</p>
<p>We are all thinking about you and hope that you are doing well.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>Leslie Arnold</p>
<p>Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p><strong>Weld RE-5J Updates and In-Person School Closures</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Weld RE-5J Families,</p>
<p>After talking with the Weld County Health Department and the Governor’s office this morning, in-person learning for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year is cancelled. This closure includes all summer school programming that would have taken place in June and July. This action is the safest decision for our students, staff and families, and is in the best interest of our community at large.  Our Weld RE-5J Cloud School will continue and we appreciate ALL the students and families that are connecting in this unique remote learning opportunity!</p>
<p>Our teachers and staff have a plan in place to continue remote learning for the remainder of this school year.  Although we will not be doing in-person summer school, we will be offering summer Cloud School for <strong>FREE</strong> for any/all students, PRE-K through 11th grade, that would like to participate in some tutoring for a specific subject, for continued engagement, and to learn new content in reading and math.  I will be working with our teachers to determine who is interested in working in a personalized summer Cloud School environment and a survey will be going out to all our families next week to see how much interest there is in this offering.  I anticipate that the summer learning can be scheduled around your commitments and for a few hours each week. Summer day-care is still a possibility in our schools. We continue to work with the YMCA and other day-care providers to open up to small groups for day-care possibilities.  Day-care needs will be included in the survey that is sent out next week and we would appreciate your feedback on your needs for the summer.</p>
<p>Lunch/breakfast will continue through the end of May.  I will keep you updated on how we will work with the Weld County Food Banks, churches, and others who will provide lunch throughout the summer.  I am committed to finding ways to fund and deliver food for every child in our community until we are back in school this fall where we can resume normal lunch services.</p>
<p>All students, except for our 12th graders, will be able to <u><strong>continue</strong></u> to use the district’s iPads throughout the summer, regardless if you participate in summer Cloud School or not.  If you are moving this summer, please contact your principal to return the iPad prior to you leaving. We will work with our seniors to return their iPads before the end of May.  If you still need an iPad for your child, please contact your school’s principal.</p>
<p>Locker/desk cleanout will be happening on a school-by-school basis.  Your school’s principal will contact you on the details for clean-out and pick-up.</p>
<p>As of now, in-person graduation ceremonies have been postponed to at least July or August. We will announce additional tentative graduation schedules as soon as possible. We know it is not ideal and that it means that some students won’t be able to attend the ceremonies. We feel this is the only decision we can make that will protect students, staff and families. It is also important for all our graduates and families to realize that these graduation ceremonies will look very different from previous graduation ceremonies. We will defer to health officials to help us create guidelines for these ceremonies, and will provide more information as we have it. We continue to develop a plan to honor our seniors at the end of a school year and are working on a plan to distribute yearbooks, caps and gowns, personal items, transcripts, diplomas, awards and other items to our graduating seniors. We are also planning on how we will collect iPads from our senior class and we will communicate directly with seniors and their families once distribution and graduation plans are finalized.</p>
<p>No student in our district will be recommended to repeat the grade that they are currently in unless it is by the recommendation of the parent.  If you have concerns about your child’s learning and placement next year, please contact your child’s teacher and principal immediately so they can begin conversations with you about the process.</p>
<p>I again want to thank you all for your patience, grace and support as we move through this health crisis together. It is our greatest desire that we can continue to limit our health risks and that we will be able to welcome students back to school next fall. School may look different next year, but please know we are committed to providing your children the best education possible. Please stay safe and stay healthy. It is critical we adhere to health department guidelines now so that we can get back to our schools and our lives soon. We continue to work together for the good of our students, and together we are Weld RE-5J.</p>
<p>With sincere respect and gratitude for all that you have been doing at home,</p>

<p><strong>Updates on Cloud School, School Closure, School Lunch and our Board of Education Meeting!</strong></p>
<p>Good evening, Weld RE-5J parents! I have a couple of updates for you about what is happening in our district.  First, thank you for encouraging your child to attend Cloud School.  I've talked with every school staff in the last week and they have felt that it has been a huge success for our first week of Cloud School!  Our teachers have worked incredibly hard to continue the learning, provide new experiences, and to check-in with every student.  It may have been a little chaotic on some of the Cloud School sessions, but things will calm down with consistency and repetition.  I know that this is a difficult time for all families across the country and if there is anything we can do to help you at home, please reach out.</p>
<p>I am preparing our staff for our district to not come back this spring for in-person learning.  If you watched the Board of Education meeting last week, I stated that I would make this decision the week of April 25th to permanently close the buildings for in-person learning.  I was hopeful that there could be a change where our students could come back, say goodbye to their teachers and friends, pick up their items left at the school and have some closure but it does not look like this will be happening.  I have another call with the Weld County Health Department next week to find out their predictions for when we will get to the other side of this curve.</p>
<p>With that being said, if you need any personal belongings from the school, please contact the school principal via email.  He/she will set out the supplies for you at a scheduled time/day.</p>
<p>Due to the weather coming in on THURSDAY of this week, we will be passing out DOUBLE lunches/breakfasts tomorrow (Wednesday) to all children who either show up to Milliken Elementary School and Roosevelt High School between 11am-noon or at our designated bus stops throughout the community.  No LUNCHES will be served on Thursday of this week!  We have served over 17,000 lunches so far and we would like to continue serving every child that lives in our community a lunch and breakfast!</p>
<p>Finally, the Board of Education will meet tomorrow night.  Because the meetings are now virtual, you can check out our website and FaceBook page at 7PM to view the LiveStream by clicking on the link that will be posted at that time.  You can find the agenda for the Board of Education meetings at this link:  <a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/co/weldre5j/Board.nsf/vpublic?open">https://go.boarddocs.com/co/weldre5j/Board.nsf/vpublic?open</a><br>
If you would like to participate in public comment on agenda items, you can email your comment to:  <a href="mailto:listen@weldre5j.org">listen@weldre5j.org</a> and your comment will be posted.</p>
<p>Thank you for encouraging your children to participate in Cloud School.  There are many reasons to opt out of this resource.  But I can provide you with some important reasons why Cloud School is beneficial for every child.  The biggest one is that they need to see their classmates and their teacher.  There needs to be some consistency and normalcy in their life with school, especially when it is feeling so disconnected right now.  We care about your children and we want to "see" them!  And we miss them terribly.  I hope that you all are doing well and staying healthy.  I would like to leave you with a social media post that was shared with me last week (I do not know the author):</p>
<p>"Don't worry about your child regressing in school.  Every single kid is in the same boat and they will be ok.  When we are back in the classroom, we will all course correct to meet them where they are.  Teachers are experts at this!  Don't pick fights with your kids because they are struggling to do their homework.  Don't mandate learning, encourage it.  If I can leave you with one thing, it's this:  At the end of all this, your kids' mental health will be more important than their academic skills.  And how they felt during this time will stay with them long after the memory of what they did during these weeks at home is long gone."<br>
We love and care about your children.  Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help you through this time of home learning.  We hope to see everyone very soon!</p>
<p>Leslie Arnold, Superintendent of Schools and the Weld RE-5J Staff<br>

<p><strong>Updates to the Weld RE-5J Community 3/29/2020</strong></p>
<p>
Happy Sunday, Weld RE-5J Families!</p>
<p>I hope you are enjoying this beautiful weekend!  I wanted to provide you a couple of updates before we enter into spring break.</p>
<p>Our teachers have worked tirelessly at trying to figure out how to move their lessons and enrichment to an online format.  I'm so proud of the work that they have accomplished and know that they only have the best interest at heart for your child--and that they miss each of our students tremendously.  </p>
<p>Some of the formats (like Google Classroom) that our teachers are using will show things to students like, "Due Date", "Assignment", "Turn in By" or "Grade".  Please know that all the activities we are providing to your child are for the continuation of learning to happen at home.  We cannot change the format of our programs but all our teachers know that the enrichment materials that they are creating are just that -- enrichment.  We hope you will consider trying our Cloud School on April 6th, 2020 when our teachers return from spring break!  We would like for everyone to have a sense of normalcy in their schedule and to offer extensions to what has been learned this year in school.</p>
<p>If your child is taking a class from AIMS, FRCC, UNC, etc., these classes will be graded and they must attend online.  If you have questions about the classwork, please do not hesitate to ask your child's teacher or principal.</p>
<p>We will continue serving lunch Monday-Friday of spring break!  We have two pick-up places (RHS and MES) for any child in our community and multiple bus stops throughout both towns.  If there are quite a few children living in your area and feel that we should include a lunch bus stop, please email the information to <a href="mailto:listen@weldre5j.org">listen@weldre5j.org</a>.</p>
<p>We are here to help.  Please do not feel overwhelmed with the classwork.  Our teachers and counselors will be hosting virtual office hours beginning April 6th and it is important for your child to stay connected in some way to us, if possible.  If you need internet at your house, if you need lunches, if you need assistance with a schedule or classwork, we are here for you.  Email your child's principal and let them know what is going on!  We do not have any idea if we will be going back to school this spring.  This is now in the Governor's hands and we are waiting for decisions to be made at that level in regards to school, graduation, etc.</p>
<p>Continue to explore the online options and create a schedule for your child(ren).  This is a strange time for everyone but we know that we can come through this stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

<p><strong>Weld RE-5J Will Be Closed from Monday, March 16th, 2020 - Friday, April 17th, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Important Information &amp; Updates from Weld RE-5J 3/21/2020</p>
<p>Dear Weld RE-5J Families, <br>
I wanted to take a moment to let you know what we have been working on this past week for next week and beyond.  First and foremost, I hope that you all are doing well, staying healthy, and creating a new normal!  My team and I want you to know that we miss each and every one of our students and families and are hoping and praying that you are all safe.  We have had 120 wonderful days with your child and we want to continue that connection through the rest of this school year!</p>
<p>
<strong>Governor's Call Yesterday:  </strong>I participated on a call yesterday with the Governor and the Commissioner for the Colorado Department of Education (CDE).  You will see updates throughout this email but the most important item I want you to know is that although the Governor has indicated that this school closure is currently through April 17th, 2020, he asked every superintendent to be prepared to go longer in case this will be extended through the rest of the year.  He was asked when that decision to continue the closure would be made and the Governor indicated that he would make the decision to extend the school closures the week of April 13th, 2020.  <strong>This is no longer my decision to open/continue to close schools.</strong>  We will be following what our Public Health Departments and our state officials determine the best course of action for our state.  Our Weld RE-5J team is preparing for the worst but hoping for the best in this situation!  Superintendents were also told that there will be waivers submitted to the federal level to release us from the 160 day contact time this year.  This means that we will not be required to make up the time missed when we come back to school.  Our staff is committed to provide any type of support and assistance throughout this spring and summer, if needed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Spring Break: </strong> From March 30th-April 3rd is our scheduled spring break.  Our teachers will be off during this time but we will continue to serve lunches (see the schedule, below).<br>
Although this email is long, please make sure you read through it and do not hesitate to email me if you have any questions. (<a href="mailto:leslie.arnold@weldre5j.org">leslie.arnold@weldre5j.org</a>)</p>
<p>
<strong>Information For All Families: </strong> This upcoming week, our amazing teachers and paraprofessionals will begin planning our new "Cloud School" that will roll out fully on April 6th.  We know that not all of you have internet access at home and our teachers will be calling/connecting with you to find out who does not have access so that we can leave packets of instruction and enrichment activities at your porch.  Please make sure you let your child's teacher know if you do not have internet access.  There are some possible internet access solutions at the bottom of this email.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud School Information:  </strong>Beginning April 6th, 2020, your child's teacher will be posting enrichment lessons on the platform that the teacher chooses (the teacher will let your child know which platform, example:  Google Classroom) by 9AM each Monday-Friday morning.  I've asked that they only post 2-3 hours of enrichment/instruction per day for elementary students and 3-5 hours per day for middle/high school students.  This will include reading, math, writing, science, social studies, PE, Music, Art, etc. We are encouraging every student to participate and to stay engaged with each other as much as possible.  Our teachers are setting up ZOOM accounts, Google Hangouts, etc., in order to virtually see/hear how your child is progressing.  Again, if you need additional information and support as a parent, please let your child's teacher know and we will help! </p>
<p>Our teachers will be connecting with you and your child weekly through calls and emails.  Please make sure that there is time set aside for a quick check-in to see how we can help and to make sure you are getting the support you need.<br>
Many of your children have already started connecting with our teachers!  Next week is the week that all teachers will be setting up their virtual classrooms and making sure each student has access to what they need.<br>
Your older children can sign-up for a FREE ZOOM account to keep in touch virtually with friends!  It's easy and fun!  Sign-up <a href="https://zoom.us/pricing">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lunch Delivery/Pick-Up Changes:  </strong>We are expanding our lunch pick-up AND we will be delivering to neighborhoods beginning on Wednesday, March 25, 2020!  Please see the schedule for dates/times of changes:</p>
<p><strong>Lunch PICK-UP for Monday and Tuesday of Next Week:  </strong>We will only have a pick-up station at Milliken Elementary School from 11-noon on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  This is for ANY child in our district 1-18 years of age, no restrictions!  This is drive through only 11am-noon.  Children will receive a lunch and a breakfast for the next day.  We will continue our lunch pick-up at Milliken Elementary School Monday-Friday each week through our school closure.<br><strong>Lunch PICK-UP for Wednesday and Continuing Through Our School Closure:  </strong>We will have TWO pick-up stations beginning on March 25th, 2020 for ANY child in our school district, aged 1-18, Monday-Friday of each week.  Starting on Wednesday of next week, you can drive through the front of RHS and Milliken Elementary School.  We will be serving throughout spring break as well! 11am-noon each day.  Children will receive a lunch and a breakfast for the next day.<br><strong>Lunch DELIVERY Schedule Beginning March 25th and Continuing Through Our School Closure:  </strong>Our transportation department will begin delivering lunches at the following times to these neighborhoods, beginning on Wednesday and continuing M-F through school closure.  Our busses will stop at each of these delivery points and hand out lunches to children who show up, ages 1-18 years old.  We will be serving from the front of the bus and the back of the bus.  We encourage families to only show up if it is difficult for you to go through the pick-up stations at the schools.  Also, please keep a six foot physical distance from each other while picking up your lunches.  We will monitor how many we need each day and if we run out of lunches, we will try to adjust the next day to bring more.  Last week, we had over 1200 lunches served.  We are trying to feed as many children we can in our community. <strong> Remember, this is for ALL children in our community and it is FREE.</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Information for HS Families:  </strong>We still do not have direction from CDE on graduation requirements for our HS Seniors this year.  We will be receiving those guidelines next week, according to the Department of Education.

<p><strong>Apps Recently Pushed Onto You Child's iPad:  </strong>Our IT team recently pushed OverDrive, Hoopla, and Libby (all public library lending for e-books).  You will need a library card in order to check out books.  If you find other applications that our children would benefit from, please share these apps to <a href="mailto:listen@weldre5j.org">listen@weldre5j.org</a>.  If you keep your child's iPad connected to your internet, we can push out applications for everyone.</p>

I look forward to seeing everyone healthy and happy on the other side of this "curve"!  We can do this!  We are Weld RE-5J strong!<br>

<p>
Dear Weld RE-5J Families,</p>
<p>We want to thank you first and foremost for doing whatever it takes to continue the learning at home!  With that said, the Governor of Colorado just extended school closures until at least April 17th, 2020.  We know that this causes quite a bit of stress for some of our families and we want you to know that we are here to help.</p>
<p>Here are some updates for you:</p>
<p>We made the decision to continue serving lunches to your children during our spring break week, March 30th - April 3rd.  We will serve lunches each week-day until this school closure is over or until summer break.  Right now, the lunches can be picked up at Milliken Elementary School and are for ANY child in our community ages 0-18.  Today we served over 340 lunches!  We hope we get more and more of you coming to Milliken Elementary each day from 11 am to noon Monday through Friday so that we can give your child(ren) a lunch and a breakfast.  </p>
<p>We also passed out over 400 iPads to our parents who have children in grades K-3!  THANK YOU for coming and getting them!  We have another iPad handout tomorrow for our parents who signed up.  If the weather is too bad tomorrow, please contact your child's principal to schedule another time to pick up the iPad.  </p>
<p>Our teachers will be planning more and more lessons and enrichment for every child starting next week.  Until then, please make sure you review the resources we posted yesterday in an email and on our Facebook page if you need ideas for your child.  We do not have a playbook for this type of closure -- it is new to everyone.  We all appreciate the grace and patience you have provided us as we navigate this new "normal".  </p>
<p>We also want to share with you that we have unblocked all YouTube access on your child's school device.  The reason we made that decision is that many of our curriculum resources and enrichment resources have video components on YouTube.  Since we will all be away from our students for an extended period of time, we needed to unblock YouTube so our teachers can share the resources with your child.  With that being said, we are asking that you be diligent in monitoring what your child is viewing on his/her iPad/computer.  </p>
<p>We hope that you are staying healthy in all aspects and that if you need anything, please do not hesitate to reach out.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Weld RE-5J Team<br>

<p><strong>Weld RE-5J Updates and Instructional Information 3/17/2020</strong></p>
<p>
Dear Weld RE-5J Families:<br>
We realize that all of the uncertainty these past few weeks may be causing stress and challenges as we all try to navigate this new "normal" for our community.  We are working hard, as a district, to help alleviate some of that stress and we hope you will reach out if you need anything or if we can support you and your family in any way.  Some items that we would like to share with you:</p>
<p>-From M-F on the weeks we are closed as a district (except for spring break which runs 3/30-4/3), we will be providing a lunch and a breakfast, to any child in our community that can come to Milliken Elementary School between 11am and noon.  This is a grab 'n go service for children between 1-18 years of age.</p>
<p>-The Colorado High School Athletics Association has just extended their cancellation of all spring sports through mid April.  Please go to the CHSAA website at <a href="https://chsaanow.com/">https://chsaanow.com/</a> to see additional information.</p>
<p>-The Weld RE-5J School Board Meeting will be held tomorrow night at the administration building at 7PM.  We are asking that no audience be in attendance but you can send any comments or questions you have for the Superintendent and the School Board to:  <a href="mailto:Listen@weldre5j.org">Listen@weldre5j.org</a>.   Also, we will be Livestreaming the board meeting and you will be able to find the link on our Facebook page at 7PM tomorrow night.</p>
<p>-The Colorado Department of Education today cancelled all state mandated testing for this spring.  If/when students return to classes, we can now focus only on instructional time and not have to take time out for state testing.  </p>
<p>-We are not certain how the Colorado Department of Education will handle this extended time off and if we will be required to make up these days missed minute-for-minute.  There has been no communication yet from the Colorado Department of Education and we will keep families notified as soon as we hear.</p>
<p>-The Weld RE-5J's spring break runs from 3/30-4/3.  During that week, we do not plan on serving lunches or having other services available to families.  If we need to extend the time off after spring break, we will let you know as soon as possible.  We are still waiting for guidance from the Colorado Governor's office on how long this outage will continue.</p>
<p>-We also know that many of you are looking for instructional resources.  We are providing you with two links that may assist.  The first link is on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvbA0Ft6z5ckYg80gsY7fQ4Y9x4FiV-4aAtX6FKiXfE/edit?usp=sharing">Ideas for Creating a Daily Schedule at Home</a>.  This link shares some great information on how to get any aged child at home engaged in their learning and in control of their schedule.</p>

<p>-If you need additional support, please do not hesitate to reach out to your child's teacher.  Many of them are excited to help where needed and can provide you with invaluable resources during this time many of us are working from home.</p>

<p><strong>Weld RE-5J Will Be Closed from Monday, March 16th, 2020 - Friday, April 17th, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Dear Weld RE-5J Families and Staff,</p>
<p>As we shared with you yesterday, we have been in constant contact with the Weld County Health Department, the Colorado Department of Education, and the CDC in regards to the community spread of the COVID-19 virus in Colorado.  As the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) virus continues to spread throughout our state, we will be taking the extreme measure of closing schools in the Weld RE-5J school district starting on Monday, March 16th through our spring break, which ends April 3rd.  If we have to remain closed after our spring break, we will let you know as we get closer to that date.</p>
<p>Our staff will be sending home any school supplies, medications, and technology today.  If you did not attend school today and cannot pick these items up, please contact your child's teacher and principal and they will make arrangements with you early next week for item pick up.  We will be prepared to do drive-through pickups on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  No parent/student will be allowed within our buildings during our closed periods.</p>
<p>We will have a Grab 'N Go feeding station at Milliken Elementary School each day of our closure from 11am-Noon for every family with children in our community.  We will have people there each week day where families can drive through during this time and we will hand each child (ages 1 through 18 years old) a sack containing a lunch (sandwich, chips, fruit and a milk) and a breakfast for the next morning (breakfast pastry and juice).  Kids must be present with their parents/guardians to receive the meals.  Parents will not need to get out of the cars during this time and can show up each day for this service.  You do not need to be a Milliken Elementary School student/parent to receive this benefit.  This is open to all children in our community aged 1-18 years of age for all schools (KQA included).</p>
<p>Before/After School Care has been suspended for YMCA at Pioneer Ridge and at any other daycare that uses our school facility to provide this service.  Please call your daycare provider if you have questions on being open or closed during this time.  </p>
<p>Any after school athletics and games are cancelled until at least April 6th.  Students may not come in groups to practice at the schools, the tracks, or the baseball fields.  Our district will remain closed throughout this shut down and that includes any athletics, per CHSAA regulations.  Coaches may not hold any voluntary practices as well.</p>
<p>During this time that we are not in school, we are encouraging all students to participate in enrichment activities that were planned/will be planned by their teacher.  Although these enrichment activities cannot be graded, we would ask that you continue the learning at home with your child.  A list of free resources can be found here:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1NUKLZN7hGSu1Hzm70kfzBKs-lsSELaEMggS60Bi2O2I/htmlview?usp=embed_facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR2zg-4VOBeE4ru1dhR5EqABfL8nR62AHrtNhfb7bQPYvRrwGaVhVRyxMfE&amp;sle=true&amp;pru=AAABcPWx9Iw*R1hbkEUXs8-NnD9Ur3TRLw&amp;urp=gmail_link">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1NUKLZN7hGSu1Hzm70kfzBKs-lsSELaEMggS60Bi2O2I/htmlview?usp=embed_facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR2zg-4VOBeE4ru1dhR5EqABfL8nR62AHrtNhfb7bQPYvRrwGaVhVRyxMfE&amp;sle=true&amp;pru=AAABcPWx9Iw*R1hbkEUXs8-NnD9Ur3TRLw&amp;urp=gmail_link</a></p>
<p>Parent conference sign-up sheets will be going around soon.  Please make sure you sign up to talk with your child's teacher via the phone.  We will not be doing in-person parent conferences this spring.<br>
We know that closing our schools will have a significant impact on our families and we will continue to work with our community partners to identify support services and resources.  We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis in our community and state.  In light of Governor Polis' declaration of a state of emergency in Colorado and the growing number of confirmed cases in Colorado, we are taking this action to protect the public health.  We will send follow-up communications with additional information about food service, support resources, and other updates as soon as we receive them.  </p>
<p>Our goal is always to protect the safety, health and wellness of our students, staff, and families.  Amid the uncertainty and fear that this pandemic brings, our strength as a community is our greatest asset.  We can work together to protect each other and slow the progression of COVID-19.  We will continue to remain in contact with public health officials, elected leaders, and fellow school districts and keep you updated with new information as it becomes available.  We thank you for your support and partnership in this effort.</p>

Dear Weld RE-5J Families,</p>
<p>We want to reassure you that we are in constant contact with the Colorado Department of Education, the Weld County Health Department, and the CDC about the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak.  At this point in time, there is no known positive COVID-19 case in Weld County.  The confirmed Johnstown, CO case was in Larimer County and there were not a connection with this person to our school district.</p>
<p>This email is an attempt to provide you with the most up-to-date information but please know that the Governor's office can override any of the plans we have put forth in this email.</p>
<p>Earlier today, CHSAA (Colorado High School Athletics Association) suspended all spring activity until April 6, 2020 starting tomorrow.  Please see their press release here:  <a href="https://chsaanow.com/2020-03-12/spring-sports-and-activities-suspended-until-april-6/">https://chsaanow.com/2020-03-12/spring-sports-and-activities-suspended-until-april-6/</a><br>
The Weld RE-5J district will follow CHSAA's lead and cancel all after school and weekend school activities beginning tomorrow, March 13, 2020 through April 6, 2020.  We will reassess the situation around the April 6th date to see if this cancellation will need to be extended for our district.  </p>
<p>The Weld County Health Department has been holding multiple meetings on the spread of this virus and have provided school districts with support and information.  There have been concerns shared that this virus may not be at its peak yet and that peak could happen in the next few months.  We will let you know immediately if we are closing school outside of the regularly scheduled spring break dates of March 30th-April 3rd and the Governor's office will let the state know if there is a statewide cancellation of schools.  </p>
<p>Although we anticipate that there will be school next week, if you feel you need to call out your child from school for concerns of the virus, please let us know and we will mark your child excused.  Teachers next week will begin preparing packets of enrichment material for your child to take home in case we are out for an extended amount of time.  Parent/teacher conferences for the next few weeks should be rescheduled to a phone call.  </p>
<p>You can find additional information about school closures and COVID-19 at the following site:</p>
<p><a href="https://chsaanow.com/2020-03-12/spring-sports-and-activities-suspended-until-april-6/">https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/2019-novel-coronavirus</a></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>02/26/2020</strong></p>
<p>We are aware the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a statement this week advising communities to prepare for a domestic outbreak of COVID-19, commonly known as the Coronavirus. <br>
 </p>
<p>Weld RE-5J works closely with the Weld County Health Department when outbreaks arise. Our district has a crisis management plan and team that would be activated in case of any emergency situation. Also, we are monitoring this situation through the Colorado Department of Education, who is in close touch with the  <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/cdphe">Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment</a> , which will be on point for all information and guidance related to the disease.</p>
<p>
We continue to work closely with local, state and national health officials to monitor this situation and will provide additional communication as needed. What you can do to help keep any flu or virus away is:</p>
<p>
<strong>Continue implementing the same practices as you would during flu season</strong><br>
a. Wash your hands often with soap and water<br>
b. Cover coughs and sneezes<br>
c. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects<br>
d. Stay home if you are sick<br>
e. Avoid close contact with other people (Keep a distance of at least 10 feet)<br>
f. Follow the “ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcdCmU4SYXwmVhJrA3Pyk0gP0MTDClkF/view">How Sick is Too Sick</a>” guidelines from CDPHE for school communities<br>
If you would like additional and updated information on COVID-19, please visit the Centers for Disease Control website at  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a>.</p>
