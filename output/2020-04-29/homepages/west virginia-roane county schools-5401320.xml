<p>As thanks and recognition for their efforts during the current school closures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Roane County Board of Education adopted a resolution at its regular meeting on Thursday, April 9, 2020 - a meeting held virtually and telephonically due to social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>"<strong>RESOLUTION OF THE ROANE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION </strong></p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong> the Board further recognizes the important role of its nutrition and other student services in supporting the physical and mental well-being of its students, especially given the uncertain and unprecedented times its communities are currently experiencing, and</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong> the current national public health emergency brought on by the emergence and pandemic spread of the novel coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19, has forced schools and school personnel in Roane County, in West Virginia, across the nation, and throughout the world to quickly transition from physical buildings to remote, virtual, and other means of communication and delivery of services without much advanced warning and only limited time for preparation.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="dateline">by Richard Duncan, Superintendent [CO]<br>December 4, 2019 @ 8:30 am; Updated: March 16, 2020 @ 10:06 am</p>
<img src="roane_logo_maroon_medium_lowres.png" alt="Roane County Schools logo" title="Roane County Schools logo"><p></p>
<p>Roane County's employee attendance incentive program, which pays employees up to $500 at the end of the school year, appeared successful in its first year. Compared to the previous school year, the number of sick and personal days taken by teachers and staff dropped by about 20% in the 2018-19 school year, with those using days missing two fewer on average. The incentive is designed to balance the costs of employing substitutes, so it actually costs the Board less than when employees miss and a substitute is required.</p>

<img src="duncan_lowres.jpg" alt="Dr. Richard Duncan" title="Duncan, Richard"><p></p>
<p>At its regular meeting on Thursday, March 7, 2019, the Roane County Board of Education announced that Superintendent Dr. Richard Duncan had accepted its offer of a four-year contract, which extends Dr. Duncan's service through the 2022-23 school year.</p>
<p>Duncan joined Roane County Schools as Superintendent on July 1, 2017. His initial two-year contract was set to expire on June 30, but Board members acted to extend it before the statutory deadline.</p>
<p>The terms of the new contract remained similar with the exception of the term length and salary consideration. Duncan's salary was ranked 55th among West Virginia's 55 county superintendents in his first two years of service. While details from other counties are not yet available, the new terms would move Roane County up to between 45th and 50th in terms of superintendent's compensation.</p>
<p>Duncan lives in Reedy, WV, with his wife, Sarah, an art teacher at Walton Elementary Middle School.</p></article><article id="7"><h2>Glenville State, Roane County kick off Home Grown initiative</h2>
<p class="dateline">by Richard Duncan, Superintendent [CO]<br>February 11, 2019 @ 3:18 pm; Updated: July 15, 2019 @ 4:01 pm</p>
<img src="senate%202_lowres.jpg" alt="The WV State Senate, GSC President Dr. Tracy Pellet and staff, and county superintendents" title="GSC Senate"><p></p>
<p>Glenville State College, historically central West Virginia's home for teacher education, signed a memorandum of understanding with Roane County Schools and 12 other county school systems in West Virginia to kick off their "Home Grown" teacher training initiative at the West Virginia State Capitol on Thursday. Under this program, students from participating counties who attend Glenville State College and train to become teachers of math, science, or special education may receive a "full ride" through a combination of scholarships and grants. GSC and the counties hope that by giving potential teachers treatment usually reserved for star athletes, including enhanced mentoring and supports, more teachers will choose to stay close to home and address WV's growing teacher shortage problem.</p>
<p>Pictured here are the West Virginia State Senate, who recognized GSC and the counties with SR 35, Glenville State President Dr. Tracy Pellet and staff, and county superintendents.</p></article><article id="8"><h2>Voters Approve School Bond</h2>
