		<p id="generic_paragraph">
			Here is a <a href="downloads/COVID-19_faq_montabella.pdf" target="_blank">Covid-19 FAQ</a> from Montabella Schools.  Hopefully this will help answer some questions that we have recieved from the community.<br></p>
		<hr width="85%">
<!--Special Announcement Section
		<h1>Montabella Families,</h1>
		<p id="generic_paragraph">
			Earlier today Governor Whitmer signed an executive order that shuts down all face to face learning for K-12 schools for the remainder of the school year.  We are in quite a unique situation and the district supports all efforts to keep the students and community safe in these very difficult times.  The order closes down buildings, it does not close down learning.  We ask for your patience and understanding as the district works to develop a plan for continuous learning for the remainder of the school year.  <br></br>There are still lots of unanswered questions and decisions that will need to be made after careful consideration.  As decisions are made, we will communicate that out with everyone.  The first thing that we need to determine is what families have access and devices to conduct online learning.  Each family will be receiving personal contact from the school within the next week inquiring about online access.  It is crucial for us to have this accurate information in order to prepare a usable plan going forward.</br><br>

			Our number one concern remains the health and safety of students and the community, both physically and emotionally.   We are Mustang strong and will get through this together.</a></br><br>
			
		</p>
		<hr width="85%">--><!--Technology Issued to Students--><h1>Chromebooks for loan to students in need...</h1>
		<p id="generic_paragraph">
			Montabella Schools will be loaning Chromebooks to families for students to use.  We anticipate that our closure will be longer than originally planned so we want to provide students with every opportunity to get online to complete schoolwork and communicate with teachers.  Chromebooks will be available at the designated food pick up spots on Thursday, April 2.  A loan agreement must be signed by a parent in order to receive a Chromebook for use.  Here are the times of the food and Chromebook distribution.  If you can not make the times listed and are in need of a Chromebook to loan, please email smillis@montabella.com.<br>

			Montabella Schools would like to collect information about the availability of technology and internet in the homes of all students.  Please take a few minutes to fill out this survey in order to give us information about the current access that all of our students have.  The survey will ask for an email, we want to be able to have a way to get in touch with everyone if resources become available for students.  Thank you for your input and for working with us to try and provide resources that ALL students can access.  We appreciate all your input as we try and work with families through this unpredictable situation.   <a href="https://forms.gle/SScNwWrMGDR3vg3N7" target="_blank">Link to the Survey.</a></br><br>

		<h1>Financial Aid Night at Montabella</h1>
		<p id="generic_paragraph">On Tuesday, December 4th at 6pm I will be hosting another financial aid night at Montabella to help students complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid also commonly known as the FAFSA. This event will take place before the girls basketball game against Lakeview. I will be inviting a financial aid representative from a nearby college to assist us as well. </br><br>
		Completing the FAFSA is important for a variety of reason. The first being the FAFSA determines a student's eligibility for grants at both the state and federal level. The Federal Pell Grant has a maximum of $6,095 per year and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant maximum is $5,000 per year. State grants are determined on an institutional basis, but the FAFSA is used to determine the amount students received. Students who are eligible for the Tuition Incentive Program (TIP) must complete the FAFSA in order to received their benefits.</br><br>
		If a student is offered a scholarship from an institution, they must file their FAFSA in order to receive it. Lastly, the FAFSA provides access to low interest student loans. While I understand many families do not want to take out loans, in some cases it’s necessary to help pay for their student’s education. Federal student loans have an interest rate of 5.05% compared to private loan companies that have interest rates starting at about 10% and only increase. <br></br><br>
		If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me. I am easiest to reach via email due to splitting my time between Lakeview and Montabella, but will return emails within a few days.</br><br>
