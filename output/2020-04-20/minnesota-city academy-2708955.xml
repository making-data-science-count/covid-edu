	<p>City Academy High School is a public charter school in Saint Paul, Minnesota. We were the first charter school to begin operation in the country. Our students 
	have typically experienced challenges in traditional academic settings. We focus on providing opportunities for our students to either attend postsecondary institutions or begin employment. Our school shares facilities with a neighborhood recreation center, and utilizes community  
resources as much as possible. Please contact us with any questions.</p>
	<p>***City Academy will be closed for classes from noon on Monday,  March 16 
	through Friday, April 3, in accordance with the
	Governor's Emergency Order and our normally scheduled Spring Break.  
	Beginning on April 6 and continuing through May 4, City Academy will 
	implement our <a href="content/cadlp.pdf">Distance Learning Plan</a>, as 
	directed by
	<a href="https://www.leg.state.mn.us/archive/execorders/20-19.pdf">Governor 
	Walz</a>. </p>
	<p>As always, students should contact their advisors 
	for more information.  Please <a href="contact/index.html">
	contact us</a>, or continue to check our website for updates. </p>
