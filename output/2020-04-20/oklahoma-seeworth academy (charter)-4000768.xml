When information is missing in our display, it is because the information was not included in the data we received from the DOE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why are grade-level scores sometimes different from the overall score for a subject? Most likely this is due to suppression. States are required to suppress grade/subject data if the number of test-taking students is too small. This can mean that some grade-level scores that are part of the overall score cannot be displayed individually.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/gk/ratings/#testscorerating" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about this rating.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still have questions? &lt;a href="https://greatschools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank"&gt;Visit our FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
