        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Message from Kathleen McDonough, Board Trustee 4/20/20</strong></h2>
<p>Dear Neighbors, Friends and Loved Ones,<br><br>Over the past few weeks, we have been faced with unprecedented times. While Island Park might be a small town, we are without a doubt a strong one that always bands together. As someone who was born and raised here, Island Park has always been a town that puts our personal needs aside to help our fellow neighbors. I have witnessed the selflessness first hand with our residents purchasing food in our local grocery stores for their elderly neighbors and leaving them on their doorsteps. The daily birthday parades that have grown to thirty plus cars on any given day that put enormous smiles on faces both young and old along the route, are momentous. Residents making face masks and donating or delivering food to hospitals is another example of why I have such pride in our community. I would be remiss to not acknowledge our dedicated Island Park Fire Department volunteers for leading our birthday parades and driving the Easter Bunny around town the same as they do for Santa in December, in addition to their tireless efforts of ensuring our safety on a daily basis. Thank you for your service! Our school district community is no different. Please know that we are doing everything within our power to ensure that our students have a sense of normalcy with their education, while maintaining a healthy balance of down time which is a necessity for the mental health of the entire family.<br><br>As an educator and mother of a sixth and third grader, I understand the challenges of finding a healthy balance between working from home as a government employee and ensuring my children have completed their daily assignments, all while keeping everyone healthy, happy and safe. Some days are harder than others and that is okay. I have found that maintaining a schedule that consists of breaking up their day works best for us. You know your child best! If they need some down time then give it to them. You can always let them grab a snack, have a picnic in your backyard or go for a family walk while practicing social distancing to enable your child to regroup and then continue their assignments. Some children work best standing; let them stand. Other children work best laying on the floor, so let them lay. There will be plenty of time for them to sit still in their desks when everyone returns to school. If you need assistance with your school aged child I encourage you to reach out to your child’s principal, teachers, psychologist, social worker, related service provider or support staff. They are here and willing to assist you with any academic concerns you might have.<br><br>Just like our Island Park teachers, I must continue to provide instruction to my students through distance learning. The struggle of continuing to educate my students without my materials in hand is at times challenging. I have learned to embrace the internet and the available materials within it. Google Classroom and I have become best friends over the last few weeks. I have spent hours learning about new websites, programs and how to upload documents to make sure that my students continue to learn their third grade curriculum.<br><br>I have never been prouder than I am today to be an Island Park School District Trustee and represent this beautiful community. Our teachers and administration are truly top notch. Once again, they were faced to make last minute decisions with constant changing hurdles and did not once hesitate to put their personal needs aside and rise to the occasion. In doing so, their goals have always remained the same: to ensure the safety, well being and education of your child(ren). They have accomplished this without ever having missed a beat. Know that all we are asking of you is to try your very best. Once we are all back together in our classrooms, our faculty, staff and administration will ensure that any gaps your child may experience will be addressed. That is what we are trained to do. As educators, we worry about your children because they become ours the moment they walk through that door. Thank you for sharing them with us!<br><br>At this point in time my son should be playing on his Little League team, learning new karate moves and attending religion classes. My daughter should have been in school on her birthday celebrating by having her locker decorated for the first time, taking religion classes and performing in our school play. My mother had to celebrate her 75th birthday by herself because we are listening to the professionals and practicing social distancing. My hope is that we will all get past this and are back spending time with our loved ones and creating beautiful new memories together shortly.<br><br>I try to live my life by finding the positives, even in the worst scenarios. The Coronavirus pandemic is currently our worst scenario. So here are some positives that I have experienced; I have enjoyed lengthy family dinners with my children without having to race to a practice or meeting, I have cooked meals with my children, I have popped popcorn and cuddled with my children to watch movies or read books almost daily because we have the time, we have gone on walks keeping our distance from others, I have read Facebook posts encouraging people to support our local restaurants, I have watched families spending time together as they pass our home and most importantly, I have created lasting memories with my children that we will cherish forever. I encourage you to look for the daily positives in your life right now. I promise they are there, you just have to look.<br><br>A special thanks to our Island Park residents that are out there placing their lives in danger to keep us safe. Please join me in honoring their tireless efforts by staying home and practicing social distancing. I can’t wait to see you around town and back at our schools and events. Until then, stay safe.<br><br>Respectfully,<br><br>Kathleen McDonough<br>Island Park School Board Trustee</p>

My hope is that we will all get past this and are back spending time with our loved ones and creating beautiful new memories together shortly.<br><br>I try to live my life by finding the positives, even in the worst scenarios. The Coronavirus pandemic is currently our worst scenario. So here are some positives that I have experienced; I have enjoyed lengthy family dinners with my children without having to race to a practice or meeting, I have cooked meals with my children, I have popped popcorn and cuddled with my children to watch movies or read books almost daily because we have the time, we have gone on walks keeping our distance from others, I have read Facebook posts encouraging people to support our local restaurants, I have watched families spending time together as they pass our home and most importantly, I have created lasting memories with my children that we will cherish forever. I encourage you to look for the daily positives in your life right now. I promise they are there, you just have to look.<br><br>A special thanks to our Island Park residents that are out there placing their lives in danger to keep us safe. Please join me in honoring their tireless efforts by staying home and practicing social distancing. I can’t wait to see you around town and back at our schools and events. Until then, stay safe.<br><br>Respectfully,<br><br>Kathleen McDonough<br>Island Park School Board Trustee</p>

                            <p>April 17, 2020</p>
<p>Dear Island Park Families;</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you and your family safe and healthy. I want to thank you for your patience and understanding during this unprecedented time in education. Please know that we are committed to having your child connected to Lincoln Orens Middle School and their individual teachers during this school closure.  </p>
<p>We have now been distance learning for approximately 5 weeks. The third quarter ended on April 8, 2020; therefore, it is important that we share with you how we will be marking the third quarter and moving forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Third Quarter<br>The third quarter ended on April 8, 2020. However, due to the school closure, our last day of traditional learning took place on March 13, 2020.  We began Distance Learning on March 17, 2020. Our main goal in decisions regarding grading and report cards is to communicate progress that is representative of each student’s achievement, helpful to parents, and supportive of students. Students’ grades should not be penalized by the loss of in-class learning days; nor should they be inflated because of it. This means that our teachers will consider assessments, project assignments, and classwork that was handed in prior to March 13th. Work completed between March 17, 2020 through April 8, 2020 via Distance Learning will be included if it enhances the grade for the student for the third quarter. The grade for work habits (your child’s level of effort, preparedness, timeliness, consistency with follow-through, etc) will be managed the same way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fourth Quarter<br>As we move into the last marking period, we will continue to focus on creating quality lessons that will engage our students throughout their distance learning experience. Our expectation is that students will continue to complete all assignments to the best of their ability.  Assignments and assessments completed via distance learning will be graded for the fourth quarter. We are coordinating our approach to grading in conjunction with Long Beach Middle School. More specific information will be forthcoming. </p>
<p>Your child should be signing in to Google classroom daily, and checking on their assigned work for all of their classes. It is important that parent(s)/guardian(s) review the work their child has completed. If you or your child is having a difficult time with any of the assignments, please send an email to the teacher and title the subject line:  Virtual Hand Raise. </p>
<p>Thank you to all of our students who participated in our Virtual Spirit Week. Together, we are better and stronger!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bruce Hoffman, Ed.D.<br>Principal</p>

                            <p>Dear Hegarty Family,</p>
<p>I hope everyone had a wonderful Passover and Easter holiday. I want to thank all of the children, families and staff who participated in our Virtual Spirit Week. It was so nice seeing all of your beautiful smiles! I am so proud of all the children for working so diligently during the last five weeks. I would also like to thank all of the parents and family members for their continued commitment to remote learning during this time.</p>
<p>As we continue with our digital learning, the teachers will post their daily assignments to the Teacher Webpages on the District’s websites. In order to check-in and provide support, teachers will continue to utilize email and telephone calls to communicate with parents and students and to provide support with digital learning assignments. The faculty and I enjoy speaking to the children and hearing their sweet voices. In order to provide feedback and monitor each student's progress we ask that each child e-mail one weekly writing assignment to their teacher(s) as indicated on the teachers’ webpage. Please be sure to check your child’s teacher’s webpage for daily assignments and updates. The teachers and I are looking forward to viewing each child’s work, providing feedback and celebrating their achievement.</p>
<p>During this time, it is important that you continue to support your child to follow-through with all assignments. Active engagement over the long haul is essential to minimizing learning loss during this period. In addition, we remind our parents of the importance of reading daily with your child. Take time to read aloud a story together as a family. Use different voices for different characters. Ask your child questions about their reading. Try open-ended questions such as, “Why do you think the character did that? Or “What would you do if you were in that situation?” Aside from reading books in paper form or online, invite your child to read common things around your home such as menus, greeting cards, newspaper comic strips, etc. Word recognition is an important step for reading fluency. You can use strips of paper and tape to label everyday objects in your home to boost your child’s familiarity with words. The possibilities are endless and the love of reading lasts a lifetime.</p>
<p>Please feel free to e-mail me <a href="mailto:atccameron@islandparkschools.org" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">atccameron@islandparkschools.org</a>. If you have any questions or concerns, please continue to use the “virtual hand raise” code in the email subject to communicate with your me and your child's teacher(s). Be sure to check my principal page for daily updates and news.</p>
<p>We are Hegarty Strong!</p>

                        <h3 class="post-title">Director of Pupil Personnel Services Update April 16, 2020</h3>
                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Dear Parents and Community Members,</p>
<p>As we continue forward with remote learning during this time of school closure there are some important announcements that have recently been made regarding Special Education and English as a New Language (ENL)/Bilingual Education.  In addition, I would like to communicate to you information and opportunities for learning that are noteworthy regarding our current remote instructional practices for all students. </p>
<p>On April 6, 2020, The Board of Regents adopted emergency regulations to ease the burdens and provide important flexibility for educators, students, professionals and others to address interruptions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  These include provisions for Special Education and English as a New Language (ENL)/Bilingual education and may be found at the following web address: </p>
<ul>
<li><u><a href="http://www.nysed.gov/news/2020/board-regents-acts-series-emergency-regulations-ease-burdens-educators-students-and" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">http://www.nysed.gov/news/2020/board-regents-acts-series-emergency-regulations-ease-burdens-educators-students-and</a></u></li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding Special Education, important provisions refer to the time period to arrange for special education programs and services to be provided to a student with a disability and for arranging an approved non-public school placement.  The regulations extend the time period to arrange for special education programs and services to be provided where a school is closed pursuant to an Executive Order issued by the Governor.  This is important because in cases where evaluations or triennial reviews are occurring, the evaluative process may (or may not) need to resume when school reopens.  At present time, the Committee on Special Education (CSE) may convene remotely via teleconference and also convene again when school reopens for the purpose of addressing the completed evaluations.  In addition, screenings for out-of-district placements are ongoing.  These screenings, to the greatest extent possible, are being conducted remotely.  Schools will be contacting parents regarding their child’s screening process.</p>
<p>Regarding English as a New Language (ENL) services, the Emergency Regulations address the ENL identification process.  Though they state that days when a school is closed will not count toward the ENL identification process, this process will resume promptly when school reopens.  This will include assessment, identification, and parent notification.</p>
<p>As previously announced, support services are continuing in the form of virtual instruction and telepractice as defined and directed by the State Education Department.  As appropriate, providers will be using modes of communication that include but are not limited to email, audio/telephone conferencing, and video conferencing. </p>
<p>At this point in time, teachers have posted a number of strategies and tools to support digital learning.  They include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using “Digital Hand Raise,” whereby parent and students can email the teacher questions regarding the content they are studying. </li>
<li>Tools and supports for learning in Nearpod lessons and ThinkCentral (reteach materials); MyON access for digital books; iReady, which includes MyPath as well as teacher assigned activities; and Khan Academy for modeling skills and strategies such as analyzing text passages.</li>
<li>Teacher-created templates such as graphic organizers for note-taking and independent reading.</li>
<li>Reading response choice boards which include creating puzzles, sentence writing, practicing vowels and consonants, visualizing, sequencing, identifying genre, and rainbow writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well, teachers have also suggested resources for exploration, enrichment, and reinforcement.  Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Math <a href="http://playground.com" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">Playground.com</a>

<p>As always, be sure</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">to check your child’s teacher webpage(s) and the district website daily for updates and important messages.  If you have questions about assignments or content, please do not hesitate to email the teacher or provider.  Also, I may be contacted at 516-434-2620.  This number is checked daily.  Thank you, and take care during this challenging time.</p>

                        <h3 class="post-title">Assistant Superintendent’s Update April 15, 2020</h3>
                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Dear Island Park Families,</p>
<p>I hope this email finds you and your family well! I would like to provide you with a few important updates as they relate to teaching and learning during the school closure.</p>
<p>The District’s approach to continuity of learning was developed to allow staff and students the flexibility to communicate, do meaningful work, and provide supports to the greatest extent possible. With the school closure now extended through April 29<sup>th</sup>, the District has shifted its approach to allow for more introduction of “new learning” while allowing for the continued reinforcement of skills.  This approach encourages students to stay engaged in a variety of learning opportunities throughout the closure. Over the course of the last three weeks, our teachers have done a remarkable job making this transition with many choosing to experiment with new tools and methods.  We are very appreciative of our teachers’ hard work as well as your patience and support throughout the school closure.</p>
<p>In addition to engaging our students in meaningful learning, teachers and administrators have held discussions about grading and assessment during the school closure. The Island Park UFSD has a reliable grading system/policy that ensures that each student's grades accurately reflect his/her degree of accomplishment of the expected learning outcomes for each course. To that extent, we have informed you that LOMS teachers will provide a third-quarter achievement grade for their students, formulated using the District’s Grading Policy, considering only exams, quizzes, and other formative assessments such as projects, presentations, or other work completed through the last date which students were in-session, Friday, March 13, 2020. The effort grade integrates effort demonstrated throughout the quarter before distance learning began; it also integrates effort demonstrated by students through a variety of engagement measures during two and a half weeks of distance learning.</p>
<p>We recognize that during this extended school closure, where the circumstances of teaching and learning have changed dramatically from a classroom setting to a digital platform, we acknowledge the challenges with assigning grades for digital assignments. We understand that there is an inherent inequity issue, amongst students, as some students have a limited number of digital resources at home to help them complete digital learning assignments while others have several. As a result, we are examining how we will provide for a fair system of grading student achievement and effort in both the elementary and middle schools as we move into the final lap of school closure. We are currently working with our teachers and administrators to generate ideas that will help us ensure grading is fair and equitable for the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year.  This requires us to consider plans in the event of partial closure between April and May with re-opening in May or June as well as should schools remain closed.</p>
<p>Dependent upon the ultimate length of the closure, the District is researching alternative grading practices.  In addition, we are working with our partners in the Long Beach City School District to align our 4<sup>th</sup> Quarter grading practices for our 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade students. In the next few weeks, we will compile our ideas for “Emergency Grading Procedures” and present them to the Board of Education for approval. They will be shared with you as well. In the meanwhile, it is important that you continue to support your child to follow-through with all assignments.  Active engagement over the long haul is essential to minimizing learning loss during this period.</p>
<p>In addition to daily assignments, please note that our website has numerous resources including: social and emotional learning, student and parent wellness, and special education, including related services.  Our mental health staff is available to provide support as needed by telephone and other forms of telepractice.  Finally, if you have any questions or concerns, please continue to use the “virtual hand raise” code in the email subject to communicate with your child’s teacher(s) and principal.</p>
<p>We remind you that during the extended school closure, please continue to practice social distancing, take care of yourself and loved ones, and take time for you and your child’s emotional well-being. </p>
<p>Stay safe and healthy!</p>
<p>Fondly,</p>
<p>Vincent Randazzo</p>

                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Dear Families and School Community,</p>
<p>Although many of our traditional Passover Seders and Easter Masses turned virtual this past week, it is my hope that many of us were able to find ways to connect with those we love. Like so many of you, I shared the occasion online with my children and their families.  Although this was not as much fun or satisfying as past gatherings, we celebrated our good health and future hopes.  For those not celebrating these holidays, I hope the spring sunshine contributed to your feelings of well-being and renewal.</p>
<p>It was most unfortunate that the NYC Mayor and NYS Governor became verbal sparring partners on Saturday over the issue of school closure through June versus the resumption of school before year’s end.   Nevertheless, let me try to make some sense of it.  The Mayor is concerned about the trauma children have experienced and he worries that with the virus still circulating among us, schools will be forced to close as COVID-19 emerges in our schools and we must close on a rolling basis in order to conduct contact tracing and cleaning.  He sees this as causing ongoing disruption and trauma.  As you know, both the NYC Mayor and the Nassau County Executive ordered schools closed on March 16 respectively; the Governor closed them afterwards, beginning March 18.  The Governor is very measured in his approach.  He prefers to gather information from not only NYS stakeholders but regional partners.  He believes it is premature to make a sweeping decision given the data and science at this point in time.  He recognizes that data changes daily, research regarding medical testing and treatments could emerge in the near-future, and coordination with other systems might facilitate a re-opening plan. This is why he prefers to take a two- to three-week approach to decision-making. Regardless of what the NYC Mayor or our County Executive decides, <u>we are under the Governor’s Executive Order and we are within his purview; thus, it is his decision that determines when classroom instruction in FXH and LOMS will resume.</u> </p>
<p>Last week, the State Education Department released a memo cancelling the June 2020 administration of the NYS High School Regents Examination Program in response to the statewide closures of schools and districts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is available at: <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/coronavirus/nysed-covid-19-memo-cancellation-june-2020-regents-exams.pdf" target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" rel="noopener">http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/coronavirus/nysed-covid-19-memo-cancellation-june-2020-regents-exams.pdf</a></p>
<p>This memo has implications for our eighth grade students who were planning to take the Living Environment [Science] Regents and/or Algebra 1 [Math] Regents. I want to emphasize that although the exams will not be administered and factored into the final grade as usual, it is all the more important that students complete the course assignments to the best of their ability in order to receive high school credit(s) for the year. </p>
<p>Similarly, the district will exempt the requirement for all eighth graders to pass the locally developed Languages Other than English (LOTE) Spanish Checkpoint A examination in June. Again, as long as students continue working on their Spanish language assignments with due diligence, they will receive one year of high school credit.</p>
<p>Rest assured, our intention is to support our students and provide for their success in all ways possible. To this end, we are also in communication with our partners at Long Beach Public Schools for the benefit of students in both communities—this school year and in the future.</p>
<p>I want you to be aware that the Department of Labor recently passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).  This provides sick leave or expanded family and medical leave under certain conditions to employees affected by the virus.  It is available at:</p>

<p><u>Finally, I have been following the County Executive’s website regarding active cases of the virus in Nassau County, with specific attention to Island Park (Village), Harbor Isle, and Barnum Island while also glancing at the numbers for Long Beach and Oceanside.

                        <h3 class="post-title">Message from Board Trustee Tara Byrne 4-13-20</h3>
                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p class="x_MsoNormal">Dear Neighbors and Friends,</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Many of us are encountering a new normal; our worlds have all been turned upside down. Isolation at home, working remotely, and encountering new relationships with our family, friends and neighbors. The empty grocery store shelves I saw this morning reminded me that this is just a temporary inconvenience for my family compared with what others have had to deal with because of COVID-19. There is not one facet of life that hasn’t changed in Island Park over the past few weeks, and yet our neighbors have once again created ways to help each other, to have food, help with schooling, companionship, drive by birthday parades (my favorite) and most importantly the mindset that we are all here for each other. There is no question in my mind that Island Park will overcome this challenge and recover as one.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">While being in isolation at home, like everyone, I have felt distressed, overwhelmed and hopeless. After a week of these feelings, I began convincing myself that this isn’t permanent, and it will end like all things eventually do. I am trying to be optimistic and focus on the benefits of this crisis. I truly believe in times like this we find out what is important. It makes me realize how blessed my family and I truly are. Knowing that my family is following all the guidelines, doing our best to stay healthy, and being a part of flattening the curve helps me get through this as well. As a community and school district we must remember, that even though we are all in a time of great peril the blessings we have been given are countless.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"> I find myself, as I am sure most of you do, saying yes to a good amount of my kids’ requests when usually my response would be no. Takeout orders, videogames, on line orders, choice of meals, are some of the things that are temporarily acceptable in the Byrne household. Realizing that my kids are concerned, and worried about their world as they knew it is something I came to terms with early on in this pandemic. Although many of us are tied up with the many challenges of being quarantined with their families, we must not forget about the needs of those around us specifically our friends, family and our community of Island Park. It is important at this time to reach out and help our neighbors but also instill in our children a love of their community and a enthusiasm to help others. And PLEASE think about the vulnerable and how your actions can affect them.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"> So many things have hit home with my family. John’s school was cancelled until September, Kieran’s Hockey tryouts postponed until further notice, and my Husband is now going to work at the hospital and seeing firsthand the struggle this virus has caused. But, like everyone else we move forward, keeping our chins up, and knowing that brighter days are ahead.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">And then there are the things that I miss doing that I never thought I would. Picking up my son at the railroad station when he had late classes, getting up at the crack of dawn to be in a different state every weekend for hockey tournaments, and walking into the office in the morning and everyone asking what’s for lunch.  I even miss all the meetings with my Board of Education and Island Park School family. I am vowing after all of this is over, and we are back to typical life, never to complain about these things again!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Our School district will continue to navigate this new normal and will remain committed to our students’  academic success and excellence. Our BOE, Administration and staff miss you all very much, and are always here to support you! Sometimes all it takes is a simple act of kindness to lift someone’s spirits, be mindful of others, and be kind to one another.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">I am praying that you stay healthy, and safe. Spring adds new life and beauty to all that is. Spring is always a new start. The best days are yet to come.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"> All the best,</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Tara Byrne – Trustee<br>Board of Education</p>

                            <p class="tinymce-block">Dear New York State Educators,</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Please share this information with families in your community.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">As we work through these challenging times together, NY State of Health is committed to ensuring access to affordable, quality health insurance for all New Yorkers so they can get the care they need during this state of emergency.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">With the recent closure of businesses across the state, many New Yorkers are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage as a result of COVID-19. Many are likely to be eligible for health coverage with financial assistance through NY State of Health due to their loss of coverage and income. NY State of Health opened a Special Enrollment Period last month for people who are uninsured, and the Marketplace has started an awareness campaign to let people know that NY State of Health is there as a safety net in difficult times like these.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">New Yorkers who are without health insurance should apply now through NY State of Health. If you lost employer coverage, you must apply within 60 days of losing that coverage. Because of a loss of income, New Yorkers may also be eligible for Medicaid, the Essential Plan, Child Health Plus, or subsidized Qualified Health Plan coverage.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Thousands of assistors are ready throughout the state to help consumers enroll by phone. NY State of Health is committed to helping New Yorkers get the coverage they need so they can get the care they need.</p>

                            <p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>I hope this week’s update finds you and your family well.</p>
<p data-event-added="1">At Monday’s Regular Business Meeting of the Board of Education, district participation in a county-wide partnership with SCOPE Educational Services for child care services was approved.  This arrangement, provides parents and guardians who are first responders or health care providers with child care coverage while they are at work.  It is a service that will be free of charge in appreciation for the selfless service these people are providing during the COVID-19 pandemic when schools and after-care programs are closed. First responders and health care providers can register by visiting <a href="http://www.scopeonline.us/" target="_blank" id="LPlnk998797" data-auth="NotApplicable" rel="noopener">www.scopeonline.us</a>. See the words, “Click Here for SCOPE Emergency Child Care.” The host site is Rhame Avenue School, <span class="_2HwZTce1zKwQJyzgqXpmAy" tabindex="0" role="link" data-markjs="true">100 Rhame Ave, East Rockaway, NY 11518</span>.  It begins Thursday, April 2.</p>
<p>Now that the Governor’s Executive Order has extended our work from home period until April 15<sup>th</sup>, we are working with our teachers to develop the next phase of distance learning for <u>all</u> students. Below are a few important updates.</p>
<p><strong><u>Early Elementary Digital Learning</u></strong></p>
<p>Our early elementary grade students (Pre K through Grade 2), were provided with print material such as books, workbooks, and other documents sent home via backpack. We recognize that our students have engaged in this print work over the past two-weeks, and are in need of new learning materials. In addition to digital learning, our teachers will continue to provide the students with learning activities that do not require the use of a computer. New learning for our Pre K through Grade 2 students will continue to be communicated via each teacher’s webpage.</p>
<p><strong><u>Technology-Based Learning</u></strong></p>
<p>The District continues to use a variety of technology-based solutions to ensure students continue their academic work while at home. We recognize that these are challenging times for our students and their parents, as many households are sharing computing devices to complete schoolwork, while parents are working from home. We understand that parents are making requests of both administrators and teachers regarding the need for additional computing devices. This is not possible.  We suggest that families create schedules to share their home device(s). Please note that the District’s technology-based solutions (iReady, myON, Google Classroom, etc.) can also be accessed using a smartphone.</p>
<p><strong><u>Quarter Three Reporting (LOMS)</u></strong></p>
<p>The third quarter for LOMS students is scheduled to end on Wednesday, April 8<sup>th</sup>. Due to the extended school closure, LOMS teachers will provide a third-quarter grade, for students in grades 5-8. This grade follows the District’s Grading Policy, considering only exams, quizzes, and other formative assessments such as  projects, presentations, etc completed through Friday, March 13, 2020. We acknowledge that students may have missing assignments, tests and quizzes that will be difficult to be made-up, submitted, and graded. Therefore, we will not expect that LOMS students submit missed assignments at this time. Given the current set of circumstances, no child’s grades and/or academic standing will be impacted by the extended school closure. Although students’ digital assignments will not be computed into their quarter-three achievement grades, students’ active participation via digital learning, will be factored into their “effort” grade.</p>
<p>The Island Park UFSD will continue to provide our parents and students with all pertinent information throughout this quickly evolving situation. We remind parents and students to contact teachers via the District’s email system using the code words “virtual hand raise” for any questions or concerns related to digital assignments. Our support staff, guidance counselor, school social workers, and school psychologists are also available to assist our families during these uncertain times. We hope that you and your loved ones remain in good health. We look forward to the having our schools, halls, classrooms and instructional spaces filled with our faculty, staff and most of all our students!</p>
<p>Together we are better!</p>

                        <h3 class="post-title">Let’s Turn the Page on March …</h3>
                        <div class="post-body" data-hidden-part="true">
                            <p>Today we say farewell to March, and I’m sure none of us is sorry to see it go. The words “March Madness” will never again have quite the same meaning. In March, the world as we know it came grinding to a halt, and friends, neighbors, and relatives that we would always greet with a handshake, or a hug, or a kiss, were suddenly restricted to remain at least six feet away. Occasions and events were postponed or canceled or altered to fit “social distancing” guidelines. Kids that normally would spend their day in school with their classmates and playing outdoors with their friends were now confined to their homes, doing lessons remotely while their parents struggled to help them learn and keep them occupied – the struggle is real! Working from home became the norm and the fight for a quiet workspace and bandwidth replaced fighting through traffic and for a seat on a train.  And even though our first responders and healthcare workers have continued to report to their jobs as usual, it has been anything but business as usual for them; they are constantly exposed to danger and for the most part are separated from their families in some way as they care for the sick and keep all of us safe. Our elderly and most vulnerable are the loneliest among us, disconnected from loved ones which, although it is for their own good, cannot be easy on them as they sit anxiously waiting for something not (hopefully) to happen. There are those of us that are struggling economically, whether it be due to the closure of a business or the loss of a job, and even if those situations are temporary the unknown of when things will improve hangs over the heads of those that now are living month to month, or week to week, or day to day. Sadly, there are people that we know that have been infected and become seriously ill, and we have heard the news of those that have died. Our hearts hurt for those that are suffering and for the families of those that have passed away, and we hope that their pain is eased as time passes. There is a saying that “March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.” Well, we’ve certainly had our head in the lion’s mouth; it sure would be nice if the lamb would make an appearance.</p>
<p>Hidden in all the gloom that March has brought is the one glimmer of hope that always comes in March – Spring. While it was not “celebrated,” the world kept turning and the calendar kept changing and Spring arrived, and with it, perhaps some hope. As April dawns, we can begin to look ahead to better and brighter days while we remain vigilant in following the guidelines that will help keep us all safe and healthy. At some point, we will all emerge from our hibernation and be able to be together again, in school, at work, in parks, in restaurants and bars, in stores and anywhere we have gathered in the past. We naturally will be smarter and more cautious – this event will have a profound effect on how we interact with each other in the future – but with that knowledge we will regain the feeling that many of us are missing now, the feeling of community. Personally, I look forward to returning to work, to being in court doing the work I enjoy. I look forward to coaching my roller hockey team and little league team, and watching my kids play with their friends and ride their bikes without worrying if they are too close together. I look forward to being able to play hockey with my teammates and friends, and to being able to be together with friends. I look forward to seeing my daughter graduate from middle school and begin her new adventure in high school, and not worrying when my sons leave the house to hang out with their friends. And I’m sure we all look forward to the day our kids go back to school! I could go on and on, but probably most of all, I look forward to the little things, like being in a store where every other person is not wearing a mask and gloves, or shaking a friend’s hand and not worrying about getting sick or getting others sick. Unfortunately, many aspects of our old routines will change, possibly forever, but we can hope that in time we get back to somewhere we will consider normal, and that it will resemble what it used to be. Our job is to do everything in our power so that we <strong><em><u>all</u></em></strong> get to enjoy and experience the new “normal.”</p>
<p>It would be great if we all woke up tomorrow and this all turned out to be an April Fools’ Day prank, but if there is one thing we have learned, this is no joke. Nevertheless, in about a week, many of us will be celebrating – as we do each Spring – the religious holidays of Passover and Easter. These holidays bear great significance during this difficult time: Easter is a celebration of rebirth, and Passover is a celebration of freedom. Our celebrations may look different than they have in past years, but the concept is still the same – we look forward to a new beginning and better times with family and friends. Granted, the future is uncertain to the extent that we do not know when our lives will get back to normal, but as each day passes we get closer to that day. Faith and hope will help get us there.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing everyone in the near future at school events, on the little league field, and out and about in Island Park. Maybe the April showers will make it easier for us to pass the time indoors so we can all be out to enjoy the May flowers together (Sorry for the Dad joke – too corny?). Seriously, I hope everyone stays healthy and makes the most of their time together with family looking forward to being together again with friends and neighbors, as a community. Hope Springs Eternal.</p>
<p>Be smart, be healthy, and be strong,</p>

                            <p class="x_MsoNormal">Hope this finds you and your family well.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">This has been a busy week.  There have been many outreach efforts on the part of our teachers to students. All grade levels are well underway with instruction that includes new learning, not just review.  Similarly, our principals initiated online faculty meetings in Zoom with their teachers. All shared their experiences with distance learning and new strategies for teaching as a result of their communications with parents, students, and each other. The Board of Education, to, will be conducting community outreach via its <strong>Board Meeting on Monday, March 30, 2020 at 7 pm via WebEx</strong>.  See our district website for instructions on how you can attend.  We encourage you to participate by asking questions you may have  through our new email address <a href="mailto:PublicBeHeard@islandparkschools.org." target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" rel="noopener"> PublicBeHeard@islandparkschools.org.</a></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">On Monday, March 30, we will resume our meal distribution program from Lincoln Orens Middle School for students who are eligible for free or reduced price breakfasts and lunches.  The meals are distributed  at the back of the cafeteria (in area where Fall Fair is held) during the hours of 8:30 am to 11:00 am. They are handed out through a sliding window in the kitchen so that parents/guardians and food service staff members are all able to maintain appropriate physical distance. We are most appreciative of our food service staff who are truly dedicated to the students and families of Island Park. </p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">We also want to thank our custodians who assisted with the opening and closing of our buildings this past week so that Belfor was able to decontaminate and sanitize all areas of our schools this past week. Thank you, too, to our clerical staff whose hours of work at home have enabled the continuity of operations throughout this period.  Everyone has truly pulled together.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">As you may have heard today, the Governor stated <strong>schools will remain closed until at least April 15.</strong>  I have not received his updated Executive Order but look forward to reading it.  More to come on this.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">While schools remain closed, in addition to reaching out to the child’s teacher for assistance, other resources include:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Writing Skills</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Proper Posture When Writing on a Table Top</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Feet flat on the floor (A footstool or thick book can be placed under the feet to assist if feet do not reach the floor.) Sit upright in chair.</li>
<li>Wrist supported on table. Paper stabilized by nonwriting hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter Formation</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When printing, prompt your child to use a top down formation: “Start at the top!”</li>
<li>Try this routine: You write the letter…Your child writes the letter…You write the letter…Your child writes the letter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spacing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have child use their finger or a Popsicle stick after each word to create an appropriate space before beginning the next word.</li>
<li>Use graph paper to give a visual cue for spacing out words and letters.</li>
<li>There are many types of writing paper. Be sure to check with your child’s therapist on the best type of paper or strategy for your child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter and word placement</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a green line along the left margin of the paper and a red line on the right to signal where to “start” and “stop.”</li>
<li>If your child has difficulty writing on the line, darken the baseline with a marker.</li>
<li>Use a highlighter to indicate where to write between lines.</li>
</ul>

<li>Make lists: favorite TV programs, movies, things to pack before a trip.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Self-regulation</strong> is the ability to control one’s thoughts, emotional responses, actions and level of alertness/attention. It can be influenced by several different factors including sensory processing. <strong>Sensory processing</strong> is how we process information from the world around us as well as what is going on inside of us to produce an appropriate behavioral response. </p>
<p><strong>Calming Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Play games that reinforce structure and require waiting/ turn-taking: red light green light, freeze dance, Simon says.</li>
<li>Yoga, meditation and belly breathing will help child develop better control of their physical body, thoughts, and emotional states. You can start by sitting still with eyes closed with a slow count of 5.</li>
<li>Routines, structure and clear expectations will help your child with selfcontrol. Review any changes to normal routine early.</li>
<li>Provide a quiet personal space for your child to calm. Relaxing music, a bean bag chair or soft pillows to burrow in may be helpful.</li>
<li>Encourage a variety of play/work positions such as standing, lying on the floor, kneeling.</li>
<li>Offer your child a chewy snack to provide organizing sensory input (i.e. Twizzlers, dried fruits, bagels, etc.).</li>
<li>“Heavy work” activities (carrying heavy items, push/pull activities, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energizing Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have your child jump on a mini-trampoline, perform jumping jacks or play hopscotch.</li>
<li>Push-ups on the floor or push-ups against the wall.</li>
<li>Organized sports activities- running, yoga, karate, gymnastics, bike riding.</li>
<li>Climbing on or hanging from playground equipment.</li>
<li>Eating crunchy foods (i.e. popcorn, pretzels, carrots, apples, etc.).</li>
<li>Play and dance to loud, fast-paced music.</li>
<li>Use toys that make noise or light up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for Children with Tactile Sensitivities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Gradually expose your child to different textures going from the least to most messy. (i.e. Play-doh is less messy than shaving cream or finger paints.)</li>
<li>Provide firm pressure rather than light touch when holding hands or giving hugs.</li>
<li>Make sure that blankets, pajamas and clothes are comfortable for the child as this may disrupt their sleep and other daily activities. (i.e. Cut out clothing tags if causing discomfort, wear socks inside out if irritating, etc.)</li>
<li>Use unscented laundry detergent. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attention and Focus</strong> </p>
<p>Also refer to the <strong>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing section</strong>; strategies may also result in improved attention and ability to focus. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a location in the home with minimal distractions when completing structured activities such as homework or studying.</li>
<li>Break down instructions into simple 1-2 step directions.</li>
<li>Have child repeat directions to reinforce understanding.</li>
<li>Use a visual timer to gradually increase attention to a non-preferred activity.</li>
<li>Allow your child to take short, intermittent movement breaks.</li>
<li>Use a reward chart with stickers or checkmarks to reinforce positive behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toilet Training</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Look for signs for readiness, like discomfort when wet or soiled or staying dry for several hours at a time.</li>
<li>Have your child wear easy to manage clothing (i.e. sweatpants).</li>
<li>Establish a schedule according to wetness pattern.</li>
<li>Toileting symbol may be helpful for requests.</li>
<li>Use charts for positive reinforcement and celebrate each success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shoe Tying</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Children typically require demonstration, explanation, and lots of practice to master tying their shoes.</li>
<li>Remember there are two common methods for tying laces; the bunny ear approach using two loops, or the wrap-around technique, making one single loop then wrapping the other string around and tucking through. Try both and see what works best for your child.</li>
<li>Be sure laces are long enough so that your child can make large loops if needed.</li>
<li>Practicing knots on a jump rope or pipe cleaner can also make it easier and more fun.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dressing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Practice dressing skills through pretend play with dress-up clothes or dolls. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Help your child up until the very last step to allow him/her to successfully complete the dressing task. Do less and less as your child can do more and more. For example:</li>
<li>Assist with fastening the zipper but allow the child to pull it up.</li>
<li>Help your child put each leg into his/her pants but have your child pull his/her pants up independently. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Insert a button halfway into the hole, but let your child pull it fully through.</li>
<li>Teach your child to locate the tag first to identify the front when putting on shirts or jackets. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand Washing</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Use Soap</li>
<li>Scrub palm to palm</li>
<li>Scrub back of hands</li>
<li>Wash between fingers</li>
<li>Wash thumbs</li>
<li>Scrub fingernails</li>
<li>Wash wrists</li>
<li>Rinse hands</li>
<li>Dry Hands</li>
</ol>

        <h2 class="tinymce-block" style="text-align: center;">NY State of Health Letter to Families</h2>
<p class="tinymce-block">Dear New York State Educators, </p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Please share this information with families in your community.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">As we work through these challenging times together, NY State of Health is committed to ensuring access to affordable, quality health insurance for all New Yorkers so they can get the care they need during this state of emergency.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">With the recent closure of businesses across the state, many New Yorkers are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage as a result of COVID-19. Many are likely to be eligible for health coverage with financial assistance through NY State of Health due to their loss of coverage and income. NY State of Health opened a Special Enrollment Period last month for people who are uninsured, and the Marketplace has started an awareness campaign to let people know that NY State of Health is there as a safety net in difficult times like these.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">New Yorkers who are without health insurance should apply now through NY State of Health. If you lost employer coverage, you must apply within 60 days of losing that coverage. Because of a loss of income, New Yorkers may also be eligible for Medicaid, the Essential Plan, Child Health Plus, or subsidized Qualified Health Plan coverage.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Thousands of assistors are ready throughout the state to help consumers enroll by phone. NY State of Health is committed to helping New Yorkers get the coverage they need so they can get the care they need. </p>
<p class="tinymce-block">Visit us at: <a href="http://www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov</a> and let us help you find a health care plan that works for you.</p>
<p class="tinymce-block">If you have additional questions you can contact the Marketplace directly at 518-486-9102 or <a href="mailto:NYSOH@health.ny.gov" target="_blank" class="linkified" rel="noopener">NYSOH@health.ny.gov</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Writing Skills</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Proper Posture When Writing on a Table Top</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Feet flat on the floor (A footstool or thick book can be placed under the feet to assist if feet do not reach the floor.) Sit upright in chair.</li>
<li>Wrist supported on table. Paper stabilized by nonwriting hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter Formation</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When printing, prompt your child to use a top down formation: “Start at the top!”</li>
<li>Try this routine: You write the letter…Your child writes the letter…You write the letter…Your child writes the letter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spacing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have child use their finger or a Popsicle stick after each word to create an appropriate space before beginning the next word.</li>
<li>Use graph paper to give a visual cue for spacing out words and letters.</li>
<li>There are many types of writing paper. Be sure to check with your child’s therapist on the best type of paper or strategy for your child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Letter and word placement</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a green line along the left margin of the paper and a red line on the right to signal where to “start” and “stop.”</li>
<li>If your child has difficulty writing on the line, darken the baseline with a marker.</li>
<li>Use a highlighter to indicate where to write between lines.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Self-regulation</strong> is the ability to control one’s thoughts, emotional responses, actions and level of alertness/attention. It can be influenced by several different factors including sensory processing. <strong>Sensory processing</strong> is how we process information from the world around us as well as what is going on inside of us to produce an appropriate behavioral response. </p>
<p><strong>Calming Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Play games that reinforce structure and require waiting/ turn-taking: red light green light, freeze dance, Simon says.</li>
<li>Yoga, meditation and belly breathing will help child develop better control of their physical body, thoughts, and emotional states. You can start by sitting still with eyes closed with a slow count of 5.</li>
<li>Routines, structure and clear expectations will help your child with selfcontrol. Review any changes to normal routine early.</li>
<li>Provide a quiet personal space for your child to calm. Relaxing music, a bean bag chair or soft pillows to burrow in may be helpful.</li>
<li>Encourage a variety of play/work positions such as standing, lying on the floor, kneeling.</li>
<li>Offer your child a chewy snack to provide organizing sensory input (i.e. Twizzlers, dried fruits, bagels, etc.).</li>
<li>“Heavy work” activities (carrying heavy items, push/pull activities, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energizing Activities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Have your child jump on a mini-trampoline, perform jumping jacks or play hopscotch.</li>
<li>Push-ups on the floor or push-ups against the wall.</li>
<li>Organized sports activities- running, yoga, karate, gymnastics, bike riding.</li>
<li>Climbing on or hanging from playground equipment.</li>
<li>Eating crunchy foods (i.e. popcorn, pretzels, carrots, apples, etc.).</li>
<li>Play and dance to loud, fast-paced music.</li>
<li>Use toys that make noise or light up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for Children with Tactile Sensitivities</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Gradually expose your child to different textures going from the least to most messy. (i.e. Play-doh is less messy than shaving cream or finger paints.)</li>
<li>Provide firm pressure rather than light touch when holding hands or giving hugs.</li>
<li>Make sure that blankets, pajamas and clothes are comfortable for the child as this may disrupt their sleep and other daily activities. (i.e. Cut out clothing tags if causing discomfort, wear socks inside out if irritating, etc.)</li>
<li>Use unscented laundry detergent. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attention and Focus</strong> </p>
<p>Also refer to the <strong>Self-Regulation and Sensory Processing section</strong>; strategies may also result in improved attention and ability to focus. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a location in the home with minimal distractions when completing structured activities such as homework or studying.</li>
<li>Break down instructions into simple 1-2 step directions.</li>
<li>Have child repeat directions to reinforce understanding.</li>
<li>Use a visual timer to gradually increase attention to a non-preferred activity.</li>
<li>Allow your child to take short, intermittent movement breaks.</li>
<li>Use a reward chart with stickers or checkmarks to reinforce positive behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toilet Training</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Look for signs for readiness, like discomfort when wet or soiled or staying dry for several hours at a time.</li>
<li>Have your child wear easy to manage clothing (i.e. sweatpants).</li>
<li>Establish a schedule according to wetness pattern.</li>
<li>Toileting symbol may be helpful for requests.</li>
<li>Use charts for positive reinforcement and celebrate each success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shoe Tying</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Children typically require demonstration, explanation, and lots of practice to master tying their shoes.</li>
<li>Remember there are two common methods for tying laces; the bunny ear approach using two loops, or the wrap-around technique, making one single loop then wrapping the other string around and tucking through. Try both and see what works best for your child.</li>
<li>Be sure laces are long enough so that your child can make large loops if needed.</li>
<li>Practicing knots on a jump rope or pipe cleaner can also make it easier and more fun.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dressing</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Practice dressing skills through pretend play with dress-up clothes or dolls. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Help your child up until the very last step to allow him/her to successfully complete the dressing task. Do less and less as your child can do more and more. For example:</li>
<li>Assist with fastening the zipper but allow the child to pull it up.</li>
<li>Help your child put each leg into his/her pants but have your child pull his/her pants up independently. <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Insert a button halfway into the hole, but let your child pull it fully through.</li>
<li>Teach your child to locate the tag first to identify the front when putting on shirts or jackets. <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand Washing</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Use Soap</li>
<li>Scrub palm to palm</li>
<li>Scrub back of hands</li>
<li>Wash between fingers</li>
<li>Wash thumbs</li>
<li>Scrub fingernails</li>
<li>Wash wrists</li>
<li>Rinse hands</li>
<li>Dry Hands</li>
</ol>
