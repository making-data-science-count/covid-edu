<h2 class="">Letter from Superintendent - April 2, 2020</h2>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">April 2, 2020<br>RE: Update on Extended eLearning</p>
<p class="">Dear Madison-Grant Students and Families,</p>
<p class="">It is with a heavy heart that we share the news from Governor Holcomb and Dr. McCormick that school buildings will remain closed for the remainder of the 2019–2020 school year. Rest assured, your teachers, staff, and administration are still working hard to provide our children the very best learning opportunities and nutrition under these circumstances. Our Extended eLearning schedule will remain on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursday with homework due no later than 9:00 a.m. on Mondays (the earlier the better). At this time, our last day of learning will take place on Thursday, May 21, 2020, which gives us 166 student learning days. This meets the state minimum number of required instructional days, which is 160, and allows for a timely graduation for our seniors.</p>
<p class="">Food distribution will continue through the duration of the year on Mondays and Wednesdays, with pick-ups from 11:30–1:00 and 5:00–6:00 each of these days. Our locations will remain at both Park and Summitville Elementary Schools. We cannot thank our Food Service Team enough for their outstanding dedication and performance as they’ve already served over 6,000 meals to our students.</p>
<p class="">Right now there are still many unanswered questions. When we receive direction from State and Federal health and education authorities, we can begin to make decisions and sort out details for graduation, grades, gaining access to the buildings to retrieve personal belongings, and other details. Your teachers, principals, and your superintendent are still available to you through Google Classroom and email. Additionally, you are able to connect with us by calling the school or district offices. We are still here for our families, and we will be sending out more information as soon as  decisions are made. Remember, information directly from our principals and administrators is the most accurate. </p>
<p class="">We had hoped for a different outcome, but please remember this is an unprecedented time for our community. It is uncharted territory for school systems and families across the country, but we will navigate this together. We are a community rich in passion and dedication to our children, and we will come out stronger together.  </p>
<p class="">We Are Madison-Grant  #WeAreMG</p>

<h2 class="">Update on extended elearning</h2>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">March 19, 2020</p>
<p class="">Dear Families,</p>
<p class="">Our teams and students have been working so creatively during this first week of eLearning. We've seen great lessons, awesome activities, food distributions, and our buildings are being sanitized. We have some updates we need to share with you, and as the situation develops, we will keep you informed of any changes. Governor Holcomb has directed all schools to be closed through May 1, 2020. This means students are not able to come to school physically, but we can still use a combination of eLearning days and waiver days.   </p>
<p class="">We have worked together with our teams to use the following schedule for our students. </p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class=""><b>Schedule for eLearning<br></b>eLearning days will occur on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.  We will be using waiver days on Mondays and Fridays. </p>
<div class="pom-container"><div class="pom-container">
<ul>
<li class="">March 31, April 1, April 2 (this is a change from our initial communication)</li>
<li class="">April 7, 8, 9</li>
<li class="">April 14, 15, 16</li>
<li class="">April 21, 22, 23</li>
<li class="">April 28, 29, 30</li>
</ul>
<div class="">
<p class=""><b>Details for eLearning<br></b>Assignments are due no later than Monday at 9:00 a.m. for each week of eLearning. Teachers will follow up with more individualized instructions for your class.</p>
<div class="pom-container"><div class="pom-container">
<p class=""><b>Building Access<br></b>During this time, there will be no building access for students. </p>
<div class="pom-container"><div class="pom-container">
<p class=""><b>Food Distribution<br></b>We currently have March 31, 2020 scheduled as our next event for free student meal pickup.  We will update you as we move forward with additional details. </p>
<p class="">If the governor extends the closing of schools past May 1, we intend to keep this schedule, as we have enough waiver days.  Additionally, this schedule puts us in a good position for our students to learn and earn their HS credits with the intention of graduating on time.  </p>
<p class="">We so appreciate our community and how our teachers and staff have pivoted to make incredible things happen in a short period of time.  We will always work to keep our students and team safe and continue our learning. Information is moving fast, and we will work to keep you up to date as we work to meet the needs of our community. Thank you for keeping the most vulnerable among us safe by staying at home and using social distancing to carry out the most necessary tasks in your day.  </p>

<div class="pom-container"><hnull class=""><h2 class="">Governor Extends School Closures, Announces More Steps in COVID-19 Fight </h2>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">Governor Eric J. Holcomb announced a laundry list of new steps to protect Hoosiers during the COVID-19 outbreak on March 19.<br></p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">Below are major highlights of his announcement, according to a press release from his office:</p>
<div class="pom-container"><p class="">Holcomb will extend the current state of emergency an additional 30 days when it expires on April 5.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">K-12 public schools are directed to remain closed until May 1. Non-public schools are also ordered closed. This date may be revised to extend through the end of the 2019-2020 school year if circumstances warrant.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">All-state mandated assessments, such as ILEARN, will be cancelled for the current academic year, and Holcomb also has asked the Superintendent of Public Instruction Jennifer McCormick to pursue federal waivers needed to cancel the requirements for accountability, chronic absenteeism and state-mandated assessments.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">Utility services are prohibited from discontinuing service to any customer during the public health emergency.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">The state will interpret Indiana’s unemployment laws to the broadest extent possible to cover Hoosiers who are out of work because of COVID-19.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">The Department of Workforce Development will seek federal authorization to provide unemployment benefits for those who are not otherwise eligible for unemployment.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">No residential eviction proceedings or foreclosure actions may be initiated during the public health emergency, but Holcomb added this does not relieve the individual of obligations to pay rent or mortgage payments.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">Participants in the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) and the Children’s Health Insurance Program are not required to make premium payments.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">Job search requirements are waived for those applying for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) benefits.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">The Family and Social Services Administration will seek a federal waiver to extend renewals for existing Medicaid and HIP recipients.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">The commissioner of the state Department of Insurance will request that insurers institute a 60-day moratorium on policy cancellations for non-payment of premiums. This does not suspend a policyholder’s obligation to make payments.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">The commissioner will ask health insurers to cover COVID-19 testing without requiring prior authorization and to not increase prices or coverage costs that involve medical care for COVID-19.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">Late fees will be waived for several driver’s licenses and identification card renewals, vehicle registrations, titles and certain other transactions.</p>
<div class="pom-container">
<p class="">Requirements have been relaxed for veterans to qualify for awards from the Military Family Relief Fund.</p>
<div class="pom-container"><p class="">More on the executive orders, which contain additional actions, can be found on the <a href="https://www.in.gov/gov/2384.htm" title="" alt="" target="_blank">Indiana Government Executive Orders page</a>.</p></div>

<h2 class="">LETtER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT</h2>
<p class="">March 13, 2020</p>
<p class="">Dear Madison-Grant Families,</p>
<p class="">The Coronavirus COVID-19 has created an unprecedented set of circumstances across the country. For several weeks, we have been meeting with county agencies to discuss this rapidly changing situation. Our primary consideration has always been the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and families.</p>
<p>In coordination with the Grant and Madison County Health Departments and the public school superintendents in Madison and Grant Counties, we are initiating <strong class="">Extended eLearning Days beginning Monday, March 16, 2020.</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p class=""><strong class="">Before spring break, we will initiate Extended eLearning beginning Monday, March 16 through Thursday, March 19.  After spring break, we will continue Extended eLearning beginning Tuesday, March 31 through Friday, April 3.</strong> A recent announcement from the governor is waiving up to 20 days of school. We will save these waiver days (non-eLearning) in case we need them in the future. We will evaluate a return to school, as well as a return to after-school activities and field trips, following April 6. Club sponsors and coaches will connect with their students concerning their schedules.</p>
<p class="">We recognize this situation is not ideal for students, staff, or parents. However, it is important for the health and safety of our overall community. We also sincerely thank all the dedicated people at the Madison and Grant County Health Departments, as well as our staff at Madison-Grant, who have been working tirelessly to prepare and plan for our students and families. While our school building is closed, intensive cleaning will continue within our school facilities to help ensure a safe environment when students return.</p>
<p class=""><strong>How will Extended eLearning work?</strong> Today students will bring home resource materials. Teachers will be emailing information by Monday, March 16. We plan on sending home Chromebooks with our students. Students can log in to their Google accounts on any device.</p>
<p>The following are expectations for students, teachers, and parents on an Extended eLearning Day. We ask you review this information as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What will a student do on an eLearning Day?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students will utilize class instructional materials shared through email to parents or through Google Classroom.</li>
<li>Students are required to complete all days of Extended eLearning. Failure to do so will result in a student being marked unexcused for that particular day and work could be graded as zero.</li>
<li>Student work will be graded and recorded.</li>
<li class="">All teachers will be available for student questions via email during office hours from 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Teachers will do their best to respond to an email within 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What will a teacher do on an Extended eLearning Day?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Teachers will have learning objectives, content, and expectations posted by Monday, March 16.</li>
<li class="">Teachers will be available between the hours of 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. for student support.</li>
<li>Teachers will make every effort to answer questions promptly if emailed.</li>
<li>Teachers will grade student work and enter grades in Powerschool in a timely fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should a parent/guardian do on an Extended e-learning day?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Ensure that your child logs in to Google Classroom or checks emails from teachers each day and completes all assigned work.</li>
<li class="">Monitor Powerschool, Google Classroom, and emails so you can ensure your child is on top of their assignments. Teachers will be diligent in keeping Powerschool up to date in all grades.</li>
</ul>
<p class="">We will be keeping our community up to date through email and phone communication. Any updates will come directly from our offices. Please know we will also post any information on our website as we receive updates on health and safety information from our public agencies. We strive with integrity to keep our families and students safe and healthy and will follow all recommendations we receive from our state and local agencies. We appreciate all the work our staff and families will be putting forth during this unprecedented time to keep our students safe and continue their education. #WeAreMG</p>

<h2 class="">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Will Madison-Grant Schools Close?</strong></p>
<p class="">On Thursday, April 2, the governor's office announced that all school buildings will remain closed for the remainder of the school year. Madison-Grant schools will continue with an extending eLearning schedule for the remainder of the 2019–2020 school year. Mondays and Fridays will be waiver days, and students will have eLearning days on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.</p>

<p class=""><strong>Will there be student food services offered at MG?</strong></p>
<p class="">We will continue with our student food services schedule for the remainder of the school year. Starting the week of April 6, 2020, we will distribute meals every Monday (two days of meals) and Wednesday (three days of meals) 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. or 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. Pick up will be available at Park or Summitville Elementary.</p>


<p class=""><strong class="">How can You and Your Family Prepare for Potential ELearning Days?</strong></p>
<p>Please begin considering your childcare options. We understand this may be a hardship, so we will attempt to give you as much notice as possible as we could be closed for multiple days at a time.</p>
<p>If a day is declared as eLearning, please set aside time to help your child by reviewing the work for accuracy and completeness. In this extreme situation, students could fall behind and perform poorly on tests. This could lead to poor grades overall.</p> 


<p><strong>What Can I Do to Prepare for Extended eLearning?</strong></p> 
<p class="">Thankfully our staff and students have successfully used eLearning in the past. All students and staff should bring necessary items home from school on Friday March 13 including medicines, equipment, and technology devices, if applicable.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Disinfect my School Device?</strong></p>
<p>We encourage regular cleaning of your iPad/laptop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the device is turned off and unplug all cables.</li>
<li>Clean the iPad/laptop screen using a small amount of alcohol on a microfiber cloth.</li>
<li>Do not use disinfecting liquids directly on the screen, including but not limited to Clorox or alcohol wipes.</li>
<li>Clean the keyboard, including laptop keyboard, using alcohol on a cotton ball.</li>
<li>Do not use window cleaners, household cleaners, or abrasives to clean technology.</li>

<h2 class="">Gov. Holcomb Announces New Steps to Protect Public from COVID-19 - March 12, 2020</h2>
<p class="">INDIANAPOLIS — Governor Eric J. Holcomb today announced additional steps the state will take to reduce the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Indiana. As of noon today, the state has 12 Hoosiers who have tested presumptively positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>"This is a time when we must do all we can to reduce the spread of COVID-19, protect our most vulnerable populations and reduce their potential to acquire or spread this virus," said Gov. Holcomb. "While some actions are drastic, now, not later, is the time to act."</p>
<p>Here are the actions Gov. Holcomb is initiating today.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Non-essential gatherings must be limited to no more than 250 people. This includes any event or gathering of people who are in one room or a single space at the same time, such as cafeterias, churches, stadiums, meeting and conference rooms, auditoriums, and the like. This guidance applies to professional, social, community, and similar other gatherings. Detailed guidance will be posted on the Indiana State Department of Health website by the end of the day.</li>
<li>Effective immediately, school corporations will be provided with a 20-day waiver of the required 180 instructional days for use as needed for the remainder of the academic year. The waived days do not need to be used consecutively and can be leveraged as needed.
<ul>
<li>If a school corporation has evidence of community spread or a confirmed positive test for coronavirus, officials should consult with the Indiana Department of Education and the Indiana State Department of Health for additional steps. Schools should plan now for broader closures, including eLearning and remote classroom options.</li>
	<li>The Department of Education will release additional guidance detailing the process for submitting waiver requests as early as Friday.</li>
	<li>Schools should follow the guidelines for non-essential gatherings as they make decisions about non-essential extra-curricular or co-curricular activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Child care and adult day care facilities should institute social distancing and minimize large gatherings. Temporary suspension of operations should be done in consultation with the Family and Social Services and ISDH in the instance of documented community spread.</li>
<li>Nursing facilities and hospitals should restrict and screen visitors. Any individual who is allowed to visit is restricted to the patient’s room. Visitors are not allowed if they present with any of this criteria:
<ul>
<li>Display signs or symptoms of illness, especially respiratory illness</li>
<li>Have traveled internationally or been in contact with someone with a respiratory illness in the past 14 days</li>
<li>Reside in a community with a known COVID-19 case</li>
<li>Those who are less than 18 years of age</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Indiana Department of Correction has suspended visitation at all facilities as a precaution for the health and safety of IDOC staff and offenders.</li>
<li class="">Individuals over 60 years of age or those with a known underlying health issue such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease should limit their public exposure. Whenever possible, friends and family should arrange to provide food and other essential items.</li>
<li>Those who run senior centers and congregate meal services should consider suspending congregate meals services and arrange for home delivery</li>
<li>Encourage businesses to utilize telework policies, if available</li>
</ul>
<p>Governor Holcomb is also issuing guidance for state employee operations. The state will suspend all non-essential out-of-state and international travel beginning today and for the next 45 days. The state is also providing employees with guidance about the use of leave and remote work options for limited durations while ensuring the delivery of essential state services. The guidance is attached.</p>
<p>"I fully expect there will be additional actions warranted in the coming days," Gov. Holcomb said. "Just as we have since the beginning of the year, we are working with partners at all levels to secure all necessary resources for any escalation of this virus."</p>
<p>If you are sick with COVID-19 or suspect you are infected with the virus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay home unless you need to seek medical care.</li>
<li>Avoid public areas and public transportation</li>
<li>Stay away from others as much as possible, especially people who are the most at risk such as older adults with multiple medical problems and those with a weakened immune system</li>
<li>Don’t shake hands</li>
<li>Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening such as difficulty breathing and call your doctor or healthcare facility before you seek care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LETTER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT</h2>
<p>March 12, 2020</p>
<p>Dear Madison-Grant Families,</p>
<p class="">As the spread of the coronavirus impacts our lives more and more with each passing day, I've been encouraged by the initiative already being taken by our teams. Our custodians and maintenance teams have done an amazing job help to keep our schools clean and safe. Our offices have been working with families to make sure we know <strong>why</strong> kiddos are absent and helping to refund monies for field trips. Staff members and coaches are working hard to cancel and reschedule events. While classroom teachers have begun making eLearning preparations as a "just in case". We have a tremendous staff!</p>  
<p class="">We are working closely with the Grant &amp; Madison County Health Departments and schools. We have met multiple times this week and are in constant communication. When we know something, you will know something via email and/or a call. Please know some social media channels or news outlets maybe "first" to publish, but our information will come directly from the health departments with directions on how we will proceed. To date, aside from steering away from large gatherings, keeping your environment clean, and practicing good hygiene, the health departments are <strong>not</strong> recommending additional actions.</p> 
<p class="">We will continue to stay in close contact with the Indiana Department of Education, Grant County Health Department, Madison County Health Department, and the Indiana Department of Health as they issue guidance to Indiana’s school districts. We want our families to be prepared for all possible scenarios, including extended closure of schools, should the coronavirus become an issue locally. All decisions will be made in the best interest of the health of our students, staff and community. </p>
<p>Stay tuned for additional updates, as these will come directly from me or your principal. #WeAreMG</p>
