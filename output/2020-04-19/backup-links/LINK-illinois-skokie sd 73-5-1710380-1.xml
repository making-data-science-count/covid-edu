<h3>COMMUNITY UPDATE 3:00 p.m.</h3>

<p>As some of you may have heard, Governor J.B. Pritzker just announced that schools will be closed for the remainder of the school year. While this was not how we hoped the school year would end, we are committed to keeping everyone as safe as possible and providing as much continuity in education as we can. We will look to the Illinois State Board of Education for continued guidance and will continue to communicate with you our plans for the remainder of the school year. We also continue to partner with the other Niles Township schools including District 219. We are grateful for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>Please continue to shelter in place and take care of one another. Together we will get through this.</p>

<p>We hope you are continuing to be healthy and safe as you shelter at home.  We continue to monitor information closely and will continue to coordinate with the Illinois State Board of Education and Governor J.B.

<h6>Community Spirit</h6>

<p>In an attempt to build community, please find a <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CSD7DZqDv-x0GSjEDZy6CSXwk1ZtaJwF/view" target="_blank" title="coloring sheet (opens in new window)" type="PDF">coloring sheet</a></strong> that we hope you and your family complete, write encouraging messages in the clouds and post in your home window. If you have the opportunity to take a walk in your neighborhood, please look for the rainbows of fellow 73.5 families. As Maya Angelou said, <em>“Be the rainbow in someone’s cloud.”</em>  Feel free to send pictures to your teachers to post on our social media! </p>

<h6>Community Updates</h6>

<p>Our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our students and families. Skokie Mayor Van Dusen issued an emergency directive requiring the use of cloth face coverings. Please check the village website, <strong><a href="http://www.skokie.org" target="_blank" title="www.skokie.org (opens in new window)" type="External site">www.skokie.org</a></strong>, for additional information regarding this directive.</p>

<p>If you have a fever, cough or are short of breath, you might have COVID-19. If you are over age 60 or have underlying health conditions, you are at higher risk for serious complications from the disease. If you are at high risk and have any COVID-19 symptoms, please call the NorthShore University HealthSystem community health hotline at 847-432-5849 to be screened for a COVID-19 test. </p>

<p>Most people have mild illness and are able to <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html" target="_blank" title="recover at home (opens in new window)" type="External site">recover at home</a></strong>. Keep track of your symptoms. If you have <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html#warning-signs" target="_blank" title="an emergency warning sign (opens in new window)" type="External site">an emergency warning sign</a></strong> (including trouble breathing), please call your physician or contact the NorthShore University HealthSystem community health hotline at 847-432-5849.</p>

<p>If you do not have a physician, please contact one of Skokie’s partner healthcare agencies serving uninsured and underinsured Skokie residents. <strong><a href="https://www.skokie.org/DocumentCenter/View/1801/Clinic-Referrals" target="_blank" title="See the list of providers here (opens in new window) " type="External site">See the list of providers here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>There are cases of COVID-19 throughout the community and the Skokie Health Department encourages all residents to adhere to proper hygiene protocols that have been widely publicized over the past few weeks. According to the CDC, recent evidence indicates that up to 25% of people with COVID-19 infection may not have symptoms and can still spread the disease. It is very important that you stay at home, even if you feel well.</p>

<h6>Calendar</h6>

<h3>COMMUNITY UPDATE</h3>

<p>As we complete our first full week of remote learning, we hope this letter finds you and your family members safe. The teachers and staff have been hard at work connecting with students, preparing lessons, and responding to activities. Adapting to change is never easy and balancing all the demands in an uncertain environment is extremely challenging. We thank you for your partnership and recognize how difficult these weeks have been for everyone. As we respond to new information and make decisions for future programming, we will continue to keep you informed.</p>

<h6>After School Activities and Special Programming</h6>

<p>We are trying to make the most of the time students will have with their teachers should we be able to return to school after April 30 and want families to be able to plan for events. We are cancelling all concerts, extracurriculars, and open houses for the remainder of the school year. Camp MacLean, the 5th Grade Farewell, On to Kindergarten, On to 6th Grade, On to 1st Grade, 8th Grade Car Wash, and the 8th Grade Dance are also cancelled. Graduation is still to be determined and we are working with the high school to make final decisions.</p>

<h6>Parent Feedback Survey </h6>

<p>Thank you so much for your feedback on our first week of Remote Learning. The administrative team is reviewing feedback on a weekly basis from both parents and staff. We will be adjusting our programming as appropriate. For example, based on your feedback, we have changed our expectation for daily teacher emails to parents. We hope you notice fewer emails and more streamlined communication related to remote learning. Please find below the graphics reflecting responses to several of the questions from the survey. The feedback survey is open throughout our remote learning experience and you may complete the survey more than once. Please continue to offer suggestions as we try to maintain some continuity in instruction. We thank you and our teachers as we partner together to help our students.</p>

<p>Thank you for your ongoing support of our students and our schools.  Together we will get through this.</p>

<h3>COMMUNITY UPDATE</h3>

<p>We hope you are all healthy and remaining close to home. The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) continues to release updated information related to COVID-19 as the situation continues to change quickly. On March 31st, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced that, in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19, he will extend the state's disaster proclamation and the stay-at-home order until April 30 at the earliest.</p>

<p>We wanted to share Governor Pritzker’s poignant words for students: </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>“I won’t try and tell you not to be sad about the lost goals and plans you may have had for March and April. It’s OK to be sad. And if you do feel sad, or frustrated or angry, whatever you feel, please let yourself feel that way. Don’t beat yourself up over being human.”</em></p>

<p>As we shared in our March 30th communication, the Illinois School Board of Education (ISBE) recently released guidelines regarding “Remote Learning.” This email will include information related to these ISBE recommendations. </p>

<h6>Health and Wellness Resources</h6>

<p>Our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our students and families. Please keep checking the village website, <strong><a href="http://www.skokie.org" target="_blank" title="www.skokie.org (opens in new window)" type="External site">www.skokie.org</a></strong>, for the most updated information from the Village of Skokie regarding their response to COVID-19. The Skokie Health Department will be contacting those who have come in contact with any confirmed case.

<h6>Grading &amp; Trimester 2 Report Cards</h6>

<p>The aim of schoolwork assigned, reviewed, and completed during e-Learning is focused on learning, not compliance.  All students will have the opportunity to redo, make up, or try again to complete, show progress, or attempt to complete work assigned.  Grades should be viewed as feedback regarding student learning and growth. We will continue to use PowerSchool as the system for sharing feedback related to student learning and growth.  Please watch your email for a link to an electronic version of the Trimester 2 report card.</p>

<h6>Calendar</h6>

<p>Starting on March 31st, the Illinois State Board of Education changed all days to Remote Learning Days.  All districts were also granted five Remote Learning Planning days for teachers and staff to have time to plan lessons for students.  Below, you will find a calendar for the month of April. All days Monday through Friday will be Remote Learning Days with the exception of April 17th which will be a Remote Learning Planning Day. There is no remote learning on April 17th.</p>

<h3>COMMUNITY UPDATE</h3>

<p>We hope this note finds you and your family members safe and well. This afternoon Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced that, in order to slow down the spread of COVID-19, he will extend the state's disaster proclamation and the stay-at-home order until April 30th at the earliest.</p>

<p>We would like to thank our teachers and staff members for their flexibility and ingenuity in planning for the continuity of learning during this difficult and challenging time. We are excited to begin our Remote Learning Program tomorrow. Please look for a more detailed communication on Friday, April 3rd, regarding how the rest of the month will be structured.</p>

<p>Our various schools and local governmental agencies are all working together to support you and your families. During this stay-at-home period, our township superintendents are participating in a conference call at least once a week in collaboration with the managers of our four villages, our local public health officials, our park district executive directors, library executive directors, and the Niles Township Supervisor. The purpose of these discussions is to take inventory of the services we are providing and to identify how we can better serve our families. </p>

<p>We know this is not the school year that any of us imagined, but we want to thank you for your patience and understanding as we deal with this unprecedented situation together. </p>

<p>Thank you for your ongoing support of our students and our schools.</p>

<h3>COMMUNITY UPDATE</h3>

We are expecting additional guidance from the Governor’s office on the possible extension of the closure.  </p>

<h6>Playgrounds, fields, basketball courts</h6>

<h6>Remote learning</h6>

<p>Remote Learning Days count as actual student attendance days. Please be sure to use the Google form posted on <strong><a href="/index" title="www.sd735.org">www.sd735.org</a></strong> daily to indicate your child in present for Remote Learning. </p>

<p>Governor Pritzker has classified the days between March 17th and March 30th as “Act of God” days.  These days do not require schools to provide instruction, however, we believe it is important to provide activities for students to complete as appropriate.  As we continue to prepare for these unprecedented school closures, Skokie School District 73.5 remains committed to supporting our students and staff. As previously shared, our e-Learning plan was approved and we will begin Remote Learning on Wednesday, April 1st. By 9:00 a.m. each day, your child’s teacher will email you information about the day’s learning and the learning activities will be posted on each teacher’s website. You can visit <strong><a href="/elearning/index" title="www.sd735.org/elearning">www.sd735.org/elearning</a></strong> for more information. </p>

<p>In addition, over this past weekend, the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) has issued information to districts regarding instructional days. As of March 31st, all days will be considered either Remote Learning Days or Remote Learning Planning Days.  All of the days we have scheduled up through April 7th, along with the Act of God days, will count towards our 176 required student attendance days. In the event school remains closed, there will be a calendar sent home and Remote Learning Days will continue to count.</p>

<p>We appreciate your partnership as we navigate this uncharted territory and work together on behalf of all our students.</p>

<h3><strong>COMMUNITY UPDATE 5:00 p.m.</strong></h3>

<p>As we're sure many of you are aware, today during his 3:00 p.m. address, Governor J.B. Pritzker issued an order requiring residents to “stay at home” starting tomorrow, March 21st. Residents can still go to grocery stores, put gas in their cars, take walks outside, and visit pharmacies. All roads, including interstate highways and tollways, will remain open to traffic as well. The reopening date for schools statewide has been tentatively postponed until April 8th.  </p>

<p>First and foremost, our main concern continues to be your health and safety. To that end, I engaged in a conference call with the other Niles Township superintendents, village managers, Skokie Public Library, Niles Township Government, and the Skokie Health Department today. As a result of that call, I would like to share the following information and resources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Please check the village website, <strong><a href="https://www.skokie.org/" target="_blank" title="www.skokie.org (opens in new window)" type="External site">www.skokie.org</a></strong>, for the most updated information from the Village of Skokie regarding their response to COVID-19.  The state, county, and village have all declared a state of emergency which allows access to a variety of resources. </li>
	<li>The Skokie Public Health Department shared there are six confirmed cases in Skokie. The Health Department will be contacting those who have come in contact with any confirmed case.</li>
	<li>The Niles Township Government continues to provide emergency financial and food assistance. Please visit their web page at <strong><a href="http://www.nilestownshipgov.com" target="_blank" title="www.nilestownshipgov.com (opens in new window)" type="External site">www.nilestownshipgov.com</a></strong>, to obtain the latest information. There will continue to be a pop-up food pantry next Wednesday, 11:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at 8300 Lehigh in Morton Grove. Wednesday evening, the food pantry at 5255 Lincoln Avenue will be open 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.</li>
	<li>The Skokie Public Library will continue to post information and resources on their website, <strong><a href="http://www.skokielibrary.info" target="_blank" title="www.skokielibrary.info (opens in new window)" type="External site">www.skokielibrary.info</a></strong>.</li>
	<li>As a district, we are partnering with our food service provider Organic Life to provide daily lunches. Bag lunches for all District 73.5 families will be available for pick-up only at Middleton Elementary School on Madison Avenue, by the cafeteria doors, starting <strong>Monday, March 23rd,</strong> from 12:00 to 1:30 pm. These lunches are available to all students regardless of free and reduced lunch status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next week is Spring Break, and our school-based staff (teachers and paraprofessionals) are not scheduled for work. Our administrators and other 12 month staff are working remotely from home and also need to be available to their own families. They will be as responsive as possible, but please understand there may be some delays. The teachers and staff are working diligently in order to be able to start our Regional Office approved e-Learning plan on April 1st.  Additional information will be sent regarding our e-Learning program on Wednesday, March 25th, including information related to device pick-up and how to access online e-Learning materials.</p>

<p>We appreciate your partnership as we continue to work towards what is best for all of our students. Please take care and reach out if you need anything. Together we will get through this.</p>

<h3><strong>COMMUNITY UPDATE 9:00 a.m.</strong></h3>

<p>We hope you are all healthy and remaining close to home. The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) continues to release updated information related to COVID-19 as the situation continues to change quickly. On Friday, March 13th, Governor Pritzker declared that all schools close from Tuesday, March 17th through Monday, March 30th. This means that schools, as of today, are still slated to reopen on Tuesday, March 31st. This projected date of return may change as further guidelines are communicated by health and government officials. We want to review several very important updates previously communicated and also share new developments in this email. </p>

<h6>Communication</h6>

<p>During this unprecedented closure, the District Administrative team continues to meet regularly and collaborate to develop effective and comprehensive plans for our staff and students.  Given the tremendous amount of information from our federal government, Illinois State Board of Education, and Illinois government, we are working hard to adjust plans, respond appropriately, and ensure we are keeping the best interest of all Skokie School District 73.5 families in mind. We thank you for understanding that, at this time, we are not able to respond in detail to individual emails. We will continue to share detailed information with all District families on a weekly basis. Please look for communication from us every Friday unless there is a significant change that would require more immediate contact.</p>

<h6>Learning Resources</h6>

<p>Governor Pritzker has classified these days as “Act of God” days. These days do not require schools to provide instruction, however, we believe it is important to provide activities for students to complete as appropriate. As we continue to prepare for these unprecedented school closures, Skokie School District 73.5 remains committed to supporting our students and staff. District administration is currently developing comprehensive plans for remote student learning that would be implemented in the event of an extended closure beyond March 30th. We are in the process of collaborating with all staff to prepare for possible distance learning days should this need arise in the coming weeks. We have had our E-Learning Plan approved by the Intermediate Service Center and will be coordinating with our staff to best support our students. Please be patient as we work diligently to make this happen should the closure continue beyond March 31st.</p>

<h6>Community Resources</h6>

<p>Please view the <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15stomBgPC56qdj6AQwXMeFuWVEjYEF82E9dCvGbBoUE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="Community Resources (opens in new window)" type="External site">Community Resources</a></strong> page that we have put together.  This includes information on food, library, and other community resources during this challenging time.</p>

<h6>Social Distancing Tips</h6>

<p>Based on input from CDC, social distancing remains one of the most effective ways to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Please remain at home. This is not a time for play dates, special parties, or other large gatherings. Make wise choices about limiting exposure to those who are ill and remain within a smaller circle of connections. Check out <strong><a href="/updates/index" title="www.sd735.org/updates">www.sd735.org/updates</a></strong> to read more information and tips for your family. Please also view the <strong><a href="/updates/files/documents/social_distancing.pdf" target="_blank" title="Social Distancing graphic (opens in new window)" type="PDF">Social Distancing graphic</a></strong> for specific examples. This information is subject to change as our federal, state, and local governments provide ongoing guidelines.</p>

<h6>School Cleaning</h6>

<p>A deep-clean of all three buildings was completed this week. Skokie School District 73.5 Buildings &amp; Grounds department secured the Celtic Environmental Services to perform this task.</p>

<p>We recognize that this is an incredibly stressful time for all staff and families and we appreciate your continued support and patience as we attempt to process through information from a number of sources. We appreciate your partnership as we continue to work towards what is best for all of our students.  Please take care and reach out if you need anything. Together we will get through this.</p>

These days do not require schools to provide instruction, however, we believe it is important to provide activities for students to complete as appropriate. As we continue to prepare for these unprecedented school closures, Skokie School District 73.5 remains committed to supporting our students and staff. District administration is currently developing comprehensive plans for remote student learning that would be implemented in the event of an extended closure beyond March 30. We are in the process of collaborating with all staff to prepare for possible distance learning days should this need arise in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Lunch Needs</strong></p>

<p>The support within our community continues to amaze us. We have heard from many parents asking how to best help one another and our community. While the schools are closed, we want to ensure all children have meal options during the day. Currently, Niles Township Government will be distributing groceries to parents or guardians of children who usually receive free and reduced lunches at their schools. Assembled boxes of groceries will be available to those parents from 11:00 a.m to 1:30 p.m. on both Tuesday, March 17, and Wednesday, March 18 <strong>at a NEW LOCATION: 8300 Lehigh Avenue in Morton Grove.</strong> Parents should come one of these days to receive a box, which will include a week’s worth of groceries. In addition to the new “Pop-Up Pantry,” the supplemental boxes of groceries will also be available for distribution at the rear of the Niles Township Food Pantry (behind our Township building at 5255 Lincoln Avenue in Skokie) between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Wednesday, March 18 next week. Dates and times for supplemental food distribution for the following week(s) will be announced at a later time. </p>

<p>As a district, we are partnering with our food service provider Organic Life to provide daily lunches. Bag lunches for all District 73.5 families will be available for pick-up only at Middleton Elementary School on Madison Avenue, by the cafeteria doors, starting Monday, March 23, from 12:00 to 1:30 p.m. These lunches are available to all students regardless of free and reduced lunch status.</p>

<p><strong>Social Distancing Tips</strong></p>

<p>Based on input from CDC, social distancing remains one of the most effective ways to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Please remain at home. This is not a time for playdates, special parties, or other large gatherings. Make wise choices about limiting exposure to those who are ill and remain within a smaller circle of connections. Check out <strong><a href="/updates/index" target="_blank" title="www.sd735.org/updates">www.sd735.org/updates</a></strong> to read more information and tips for your family. </p>

<p><strong>School Cleaning</strong></p>

<p>Skokie School District 73.5 Buildings &amp; Grounds department has secured the Celtic Environmental Services to perform a deep-clean of each building over the next two weeks. </p>

<p>We recognize that this is an incredibly stressful time for all staff and families and we appreciate your continued support and patience as we attempt to process through information from a number of sources. Our intent is to communicate with families every Friday unless there is a significant update that requires immediate notification. Our ability to collaborate and take these next steps with care and compassion is the definition of our community. Please take care and reach out if you need anything.</p>

<h3><strong>SCHOOL CLOSURE</strong></h3>

<p>Based on the rapidly developing spread of the coronavirus, COVID-19, and in order to err on the side of caution in doing everything possible to prevent the spread of the virus, District 73½ has decided that <strong>Friday, March 13 will be the last day for students to attend school,</strong> at least until the end of spring break, which goes through March 29.</p>

<p><strong>Schools will be closed to students beginning March 16.</strong></p>

<p>We are asking students to take home their personal belongings with them including their Chromebooks in grades 5-8.  </p>

<p>The District 73.5  administration will continue to monitor conditions in our community regarding COVID-19 to assess when it is safe for students to return to school, based upon health and safety conditions in Niles Township.</p>

<p>We recognize how difficult it is to make a decision to close schools at this time. However, given guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that “social distancing” is the most effective way to prevent or reduce the spread of this dangerous virus, we believe the most responsible action we can take for the health and safety of our students, their family members, and our faculty and staff, is to close our schools for the time being.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative activities for students</strong></p>

<p>Our teachers will provide a short list of optional educational activities and suggestions; these will be shared via SeeSaw, Dojo, email, and/or our website. These suggested activities may include items such as reading and journaling, playing math games, or using a chromebook (if available) to access Zearn or other online activities. Please know these activities are not homework, required, or will be graded. These activities are intended to help students remain engaged in learning during this unprecedented closure.</p>

<p><strong>Communications with families</strong></p>

<p>We know how important it is that we keep you apprised of any important developments as we deal with this serious and challenging situation. We will continue to provide you with updates as this situation develops.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and your understanding as we work together with our families, our staff members, and our Niles Township colleagues to support our students and do everything we can to keep them safe and secure.  Working together, we will get through this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>

 <br>

We are in daily contact with the Skokie Health Department, continue to monitor the situation, and will make changes as necessary. As these changes occur, we will continue to keep you updated.

<h3><strong>TOWNSHIP EMAIL ADDRESSES COVID-19</strong></h3>

<p>All the public school districts that serve the students of Niles Township, including Niles Township District for Special Education, have been working collaboratively to monitor developments in our community regarding COVID-19 (the coronavirus). We have been in ongoing communication with the Skokie Health Department, which provides us guidance on specific questions we have, and have also been following updates from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), Cook County Public Health Department, the Illinois State Board of Education and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p>

<p>As of March 10th, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our community, and our goal is to continue our students’ academic days as normally scheduled and with no interruption. That being said, we are proactively preparing so we can keep students and our staff members safe. In the event that conditions change, we will work with our local health agencies and with each other to keep you informed of the steps we are taking in response. We have been fielding questions from family members who would like to know what steps we are currently taking to keep students safe, what plans we will implement if we need to close school, and if we have any special information about spring break. We’ll address those areas here.</p>

<p><strong>What are we doing to keep our students and staff healthy?</strong></p>

<p>We ask all students and staff who are exhibiting fever or virus symptoms to stay home. This includes fever or coughing. Our teachers and staff members will work with your student to make up work if they need to miss school. As you do to prevent any respiratory virus, we recommend everyday practices that will help keep you healthy and avoid illness. Please remember the following good health habits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
	<li>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
	<li>Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap is not available.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Do not share water bottles or similar containers.</li>
	<li>Visit a doctor if you have a fever, cough, body aches, and/or fatigue.</li>
	<li>If you or a family member is sick, stay home and limit contact with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel sick and are wondering about your condition, <strong>contact your personal physician.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Will there be school closures?</strong></p>

<p>We will follow the direction provided by the IDPH, Skokie Health Department and CDC in order to make any decisions such as closing a school building or canceling large events. At this time, the Skokie Health Department does not recommend that we alter our school days or regularly scheduled school activities.</p>

<p>Because of the gravity of COVID-19, the Skokie Health Department will alert us if there are any changes in their recommendations.</p>

<p>Similar to school closings for weather, our school calendars include up to 5 emergency make-up days at the end of the year which may need to be used if schools are closed. The districts are having conversations about alternative lessons, which would be district-specific.</p>

<p><strong>What about Spring Break travel?</strong></p>

<p>If families plan to travel over spring break, we recommend they monitor the <strong><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" target="_blank" title="CDC website (opens in new window)" type="External site">CDC website</a></strong>, which includes information about COVID-19, and provides up-to-date travel information about specific locations.</p>

<p><em><strong>The following information comes from the State Superintendent of the Illinois State Board of Education:</strong></em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>Can districts exclude students, staff, or volunteers for 14 days if they present at school after having visited a region affected by the virus?</em></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>No. If a student, staff member, or volunteer presents at school with a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing after visiting an affected region, school authorities should immediately notify the local health department.<br><br>
Districts cannot exclude or deny enrollment or education to students who are residents of the district due to travel considerations. Enrollment or exclusion decisions cannot be made using a student’s travel history, and a district should not inquire as to a student’s travel history for enrollment purposes. Decisions to quarantine students must be made by state or local public health officials. Districts must not apply standards that may be discriminatory for only one group of students. If a student, staff member, or volunteer calls ahead and reports a history of travel to one of the affected geographic locations within the last 14 days and has concerning symptoms, collect detailed history over the phone prior to deciding the location for triage. School authorities should contact their local health department immediately.</em></p>

<p><strong>What if I have additional questions?</strong></p>

<p>If you have additional questions about your school, please contact your school’s principal or health office.</p>
