        <p>Fayette County’s section of Dogwood Trail between Farr Road and Tyrone Road will remain <strong>CLOSED</strong> until Spring 2020.  The County’s section of Dogwood Trail has been closed to thru-traffic since August 2019 for a 2017 SPLOST Stormwater Project at Flat Creek.  This project consists of the demolition and removal of two failing 120-inch corrugated metal pipes and the construction of a 48-ft by 14-ft concrete bottomless arch culvert.

</p> 
       <p>The location of a 6-inch gas main along Dogwood Trail remains in conflict with the County’s project.  Atlanta Gas-Light-Southern Co. has been working on a design for a temporary gas line since September 11, 2019.  Although the County’s contractor has been able to accomplish some work, the gas line conflict has caused more than a two month delay to date.  </p> 
       <p>Citizens are encouraged to visit the County’s webpage to gain the latest updates on all 2017 SPLOST projects: <a href="http://www.fayettecountyga.gov/splost-2017/">http://www.fayettecountyga.gov/splost-2017/</a></p> 
       <p>Please contact Fayette County at 770-320-6010 or SPLOST@fayettecountyga.gov for additional information.</p>
