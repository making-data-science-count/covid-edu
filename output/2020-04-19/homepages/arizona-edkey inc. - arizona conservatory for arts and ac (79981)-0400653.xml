					Although I work mainly in the evening or at night, but for several good years trying to convince my body that it would be better to do everything in the morning. I understand that my brain works most efficiently at this time, however, the endless "still only fifteen minutes," most wins with an alarm clock installed on the fifth.

App Store: average rating of 4; size is 29 MB; there is a paid version

Regardless of how you get up, morning ritual and proper optimization can help you to quickly accomplish the assigned tasks.

To the rescue, as usual, comes the mobile app. Morning Routine allows you to control the time spent on the selected activity. If this strict self-examination sounds for you is not absurd, it is possible that this app will help you to organize yourself better.
<h3>The interface and features</h3>
On the main screen of the app we are greeted by a motivational quote of the day, and tab is the "Morning Routine". Why should we give a separate button to go in the daily morning rituals? App PRO, for which you will need to pay about 3 dollars, allows you to add blocks at any time of the day or specific tasks. For example, all the exercises we do during gym, with the division on the breaks and run time). But I'll focus on the morning events free version Morning Routine, because with them I have probably the most problems...

Screen morning activity is divided into two parts. In the upper part, we can set the selected image, mark, what day are we going to do the job, as well as how many starts our day. The app also indicates how much in total is allocated tasks on the second half of the interface. Have a Morning Routine is finished, the database task, which we can add with one click. They are assigned by default, but of course you can change them. Here you will see: brushing teeth, morning prayer, Breakfast, coffee, meditation, planning weeks and many others prepared templates. Adding a task independently does not require a lot of time and it is quite simple — you need to enter a name and set the time on sliders.

Every morning at a certain time we get the notification that it is time to begin our "morning procedures". The app starts timers assigned to certain actions in the proper order. By doing this, we can try to adapt to the time set for a specific task.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This solution is similar to the Pomodoro method in a more hardcore edition. However, it seems to me that setting such goals motivates us to accomplish more specific tasks. It all depends on willpower and motivation. If you know these solutions can work for you, we would recommend you to test this application in practice. It can be found in the App Store for free.					</div>

					I quite like a long weekend associated with the holiday. So the free time I have so far lacking. I found how to manage it and can recommend to others a new runner from the Studio Wicked Witch Software. A good three-dimensional graphic design and dynamic chase between skyscrapers will not allow you to close your tablet or smartphone.

Google Play: average rating of 4.0; Android 2.3; has paid content App Play: average rating of 4; size 191 MB; is premium content

When you first start installed the game you still need to unpack more files. Fortunately, it doesn't take much time, but when the progress bar reaches 100%, you start to encounter strange things. During the tests on the Samsung Galaxy S3 my mobile is hang and off. Reboot the device only helped to remove the battery. The game was successfully launched on Prestigio. Subsequent attempts to run it on smartphone left the same unwanted effects. So now I had to switch to a tablet.
<h3>Gameplay and graphics</h3>
After successfully retrieving the necessary files before my eyes appeared a huge three-dimensional city. In the main menu, it covers the background and in the exact same metropolis, we will have to fight with aliens. I have to admit that the graphics in Jet Run really good. The climate is complemented by music that fits well in a dynamic choreography between the buildings.

Our task is to pilot a futuristic hunter, which deals with the destruction came to the alien city. In my opinion, put the eyes in the direction of fans of retro games, and is worthy of praise. In Jet Run on a three-dimensional modern city attack characters consisting of blocks, which resemble the heroes of the iconic space invaders.

Our transport moves very quickly between the skyscrapers, which in a virtual city is enough. At appropriate times we will have to move your finger left or right to get into the perpendicular lane down the street. Similarly, we go around obstacles. Gesture "spayp" up or down will allow you to bypass boulders or slide on the unexpectedly rising bridge in front of us.

However, the greatest pleasure is how we eliminate the aliens. Clicking on the form of enemies, we shoot them with missiles. But you can't shoot them too much because our transport will overheat and fall. In case of too big number of enemies special bonuses. Also available in rocket mode or slow motion, which is not only impressive but allows you to effectively eliminate the aliens.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Unfortunately, the game has micropayments. Virtual medals, which are the currencies in Jet Run can be won in battle or bought for real money. However, I still did not see the need to use the second option. I really recommend the game and while the virtual opponents do not force me to pay for upgrading your weapons, it will continue its space pursuit.					</div>

					Nothing to be ashamed of — often, the most exciting games of childhood are simple statements with simple mechanics. It is impossible to say that the group of particularly ambitious games include Candy Crush Saga or Fruit Ninja... Sometimes you just need to relax a little with something not very demanding. For example, Dino Quest can guarantee amazingly good fun.

Google Play: average rating of 4.0; Android 3.0; offers in-app purchases App Store: average rating: 4.0; size: 87.8 MB; offers in-app purchases

Dino Quest is very similar to Mine Quest. Both projects released by the same Studio, which apparently decided to use the popularity of the aforementioned games and created something very similar. The only difference is some other realities. In Dino Quest we have to feel like a paleontologist, making innovative discoveries. And also here you need to prepare for a large number of movements.
<h3>How to play?</h3>
Dinosaur bones are hidden under special blocks. To break need to have the proper tools. Depending on the degree of their disorder, need to perform more or less actions. It is important that Dino Quest we have a system of renewable energy sources, and one paragraph is sufficient for a single click in the block.

Life is over surprisingly quickly. In addition, to recover one point of energy, you will need to wait a minute. Thus, developers naturally draw attention to the microtransactions inside the game. Their prices are not absurdly high, but it's still not a commendable practice.

The clicking on the screen brings enough joy. However, it is not tired quickly, in Dino Quest there are several dozen different locations. They should be held at a time, as they unlock happens over time. Unfortunately, it looks like the authors of the program there is no intention to add new levels to the collection. However, available levels will be enough for few hours of fun — especially with regard to the required waiting time for energy restoration.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Dino Quest is not the first League games, one of which is difficult to break away. But with its help, you can be happy to spend time and learn patience (to wait for energy recovery will have in any case). If you are interested in the concept of digging up the remnants of the dinosaurs on screen of smartphone, Dino Quest is free to download for devices with Android and iOS on Board.					</div>

					The number of applications that have little chance to stir the market of instant messengers and social networking sites is constantly growing. I was under the impression that this year we are waiting for the wave of the pearls of this type because today is the turn I have another beautiful project. Peach is another breath of freshness in the world of social networking.

Google Play: average rating of 3.8; Android 4.4; free App Play: average rating of 4; size 14.1 MB; free

His idea is based on the commands that allow us to publish a variety of materials on our wall. Money they have now is pretty rich, but everything points to the fact that the emergence of new functions is just a matter of time. So it was with great interest I will follow the development of the Peach application.
<h3>Manual registration</h3>
It seems that the creators Peach has had enough of honour and refused the help of other social networking sites, which usually streamlines the registration process. Lazy, who always have synced your account with Facebook or Google+, can't be done here. Fortunately, to create a new profile Peach requires only email address, password (minimum 8 characters) and login.
<h3>How to use it?</h3>
It all starts simply enough. On our wall, we can place text or any photo stored in the smartphone memory. A third feature that we will see, is not so obvious. After you enter the "magic words" we can use a number of very unusual options. "Gif" offers an additional button on the screen. After clicking on the screen will appear a new frame where we can enter text. No matter what word you choose, it will be mapped to a short animation. Believe me, I've tried a lot of words. All really works!

"Gif" is not the only magic word that we can enter in the box that says "write something." It is here that the secret of Peach and the entire social potential of the application. I know the comparison is a little out of the way but there are some of coding web pages or programming. We write the corresponding command, and after it on our page, you receive the unique content. If you type "draw", you will see a drawing Board. After entering the password the "battery" on the phone will display the battery status.

Other commands will allow you to tell others how many steps we have walked per day, what's the weather like, what we watch on TV and what music we listen to. If we give the app the appropriate permissions, all the data will be sent automatically. Our task is only to enter the proper command. The app also offers mini-games. With the right team we can even rate the app in Google Play and the App Store. The creators guarantee that new features will appear soon.

Peach is a bit refreshing well-established world of social networking. The pleasure of adding to the timeline, exchange of information or sharing of content with other users of the app is really great. In my case, it ended after a few minutes of testing. But I am convinced that children will love Peach. Although now it has too small an audience.
<h3>Prospects</h3>
If any of the social networking site has a chance to win in the mobile market this year, I am sure that it will be this project. The creators, in a way, revolutionized some of the mechanisms known from social networks and messengers. So they provide a really powerful development tool. Peach offers top-notch entertainment and next-generation features that should be added to the application. This will not allow him to get bored. I think it will be another Snapchat — a phenomenon which still remains a big mystery for me...					</div>

					The audience are divided into two main groups: those who like to watch movies and TV shows in the company of and those who prefer single sessions. I can identify with both categories and it all depends on what my mood. Most of the time I spend alone, so to communicate with someone when watching short clips from YouTube I have no one.

Google Play: average rating of 4.4; Android 4.4; free App Store: average rating: 3.5; size 97.8 MB; free

But watching movies, especially a movie, better with someone with whom you can share observations. And if you're home alone and beside you, there is no one with whom you can comment on the application to Rabbit offers to help, which brings together people from around the world in one virtual space.
<h3>Familiarity with the service</h3>
To use the service, you need to enter the system. We can do this by syncing your account Facebook or via email. We also need to choose a username that will be seen by others. Anonymous reviews here makes no sense. The next step you need to choose at least three categories that you are most interested in. Their selection is great (movies, series, YouTube, anime, sports, etc.) and there's no way to narrow it down to certain genres. So be re

ady that the list of items displayed will be long and very complex. At the top of the screen, you will find a list of hashtags from which you can choose to slightly reduce the number of items to display.

In the list of suggested videos from social networks, videos and popular TV series Netflix. In each "room" we can directly go and watch the recording from the time when they appeared to the audience (movies do not start from the beginning if we join the audience). We can watch from the beginning, only if they themselves start a stream (here a possibility to reserve the adherence to specific users). To do this, go to the "+" icon and select any thread.

We will continue to do the same thing as when you search records from search engines. Once we start recording or join the audience, you can immediately join the conversation. At the bottom of the screen, there is a field for the chat room. You can also switch the camera with a microphone and participate in the selected channels. On a separate tab we can read about upcoming premieres and, finally, to exchange private messages with individual users.

Unfortunately, in this case, the mobile version of the portal is much worse than a desktop. At least for Android OS. The idea is good, especially if you belong to this group of people who love to comment on movies and TV shows on the fly and have no real company.
<h3>How to practice?</h3>
However, if you want to watch recordings from your smartphone, you need to prepare the place for viewing will be a little bit, because of most of the screen covered with conversations that I do not particularly like. In addition, my smartphone couldn't catch the stream from some sites and just kept me connected to the rooms. In the end, the mobile version Rabbit still requires some improvements from the authors.

The app is available for free on Android and iOS.					</div>

					The camera on the phone needs to be as automated as possible. You just take it out of your pocket and begin to shoot or record video. People who are better at video or photos, often trying to squeeze a little more out of their smartphones with additional applications. One such solution is Mavis.

App Store: average rating of 5; size 15.5 MB; 17$

With this app you can manually set the exposure, choose the framerate or even bitrate. If you care about more professional settings of video from your smartphone, I recommend you to read it.
<h3>Available tools</h3>
Immediately on the preview screen image are two vertical sliders. On the left we control exposure. The slider on the right side allows you to manually control the focus. Below is the tool that professional devices called "waveform" that allows us to control entry (e.g., screens preview) or have to work with the stored files (in Adobe Premiere). Due to the location of the waves, we can determine whether or not the white color on the film.

On the right side, we have a pointer where you can control the level of the recorded sound. Interestingly, when using the app on iPhone we can determine which microphone is active. Just below the sound indicator is set red button that lights up when you start recording. In the lower left corner, you will find a tool "vectroscope". It allows you to see information about the recorded colors. Here there is also information about how the camera loads the processor on the smartphone and the level of consumption of the battery.

We can also control the exposure by using tools such as "colour focus", "focus peak" and "zebra". Although the smartphone screen is much larger than the screen preview, for example, a digital camera, there are those who, despite their good appearance, want to see if the recorded image. For these users was provided for these functions. Personally, I liked the option of "expanded focus". With one click you can zoom in on an object for accurate focus and ensure that the selected part of the frame will not be blurred when you start the movie on the big screen.

The app allows you to use three different white balance settings. You can choose both automatic and fully manual. Just point the lens at a white object, to calibrate the right balance. Mavis gives you the opportunity to set up the camera and resolution (of course, with the limitations of our smartphone). The frame rate can range from 24 to 240 frames per second. Available recording formats: HD, 2K, UHD and 4K in 4:3 format. In the latter case, we can record only without sound.

It is important to note that the app also allows you to set bitrate. The scale begins with 10 Mbit and 100 Mbit ends. I will continue to test the app on different bitrates and compare because the iPhone records your app for the default entry, but after the first test, I was under the impression that 100-megabyte bitrate recorded using manual settings Mavis, looks a little better than a video recorded using the Camera application on the iPhone 6S. I think the test shots were taken in the apartment looked a little better.
<h3>Conclusio</h3>
Mavis is an application for which you have to pay about 17 dollars. Who is this app for? Of course, for those who would like to start your adventure, but don't have the money for a more expensive digital camera or camcorder. Opportunities offered by Mavis, represent professional tools for creating movies, so the app can learn a lot. It is also a good tool for those who would like to expand normal mode "idiotcam" on the iPhone. Manual white balance settings, ISO level, or focus, of course, will affect well on your videos, if you know how to set individual parameters.					</div>
