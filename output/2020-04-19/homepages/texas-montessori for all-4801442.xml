    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <div class="page_content">
<p><b>Allen Montessori Academy </b>was established in <b>1982</b> and it was the first, original Montessori school in Allen, Texas. </p>  <p>Our mission is to offer a warm, loving, high quality, year-round education to children 6 weeks to age 6 years old.</p>  <p>We are a school that awakens children's imaginations to the limitless possibilities in life, and a community in which children and adults find friendships and support. As the first formal educational experience for our students, our program is designed to provide a lasting foundation of skills and positive attitudes to support a lifetime of learning.</p>  <p>At our school, everyone is encouraged to ask questions and broaden their understandings of themselves, others, and the world around them. We incorporate the values and methodology developed by <b>Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952)</b>. Our classrooms are structured to address each child's individual needs, strengths and passions.</p>  <p>Success in our school is directly related to our Montessori certified, dedicated teachers, (some of whom have been with Allen Montessori Academy for over 12 years, others more than 6) and the belief in which children develop of themselves as capable, self-directed, and independent. Dr. Maria Montessori developed her specialized, hands-on curriculum methods over a century ago based on years of observing children learning. Each classroom environment contains a wide range of materials that attract the childâ€™s interest and present concepts in a carefully sequenced order, under the watchful guidance of Montessori-prepared teachers.</p>

        My 3-1/2 year old grandson has attended Allen Montessori Academy since he was 4 months old. If you are looking for that personal touch and a school whose management and staff truly care about each child, then AMA is what you are looking for. I have always appreciated the personal attention my grandson has received as well the competent and skilled staff and management. Two thumbs up, five stars!        </div>

        We have been in AMA for a few years now and I can't even begin to explain how much we LOVE this school. From the top notch management, to the last teacher. There is virtually NO TURN AROUND, which is unheard of if you look at any other daycares. It says a lot! The staff must like working there as well. The montessori education is fantastic, the teachers are Montessori certified. My children are much more advanced in any areas of life then any of their peers. All of my family members are super impressed with their knowledge and behavior. Superior value and very affordable! Highly recommend it to anyone!        </div>

        Both my sons have attended Allen Montessori on and off during the past 8 years. Both of them started reading before the age of 4 and are both very astute in Math. I attribute everything to the way they were taught at Allen Montessori. The academic rigor is second to none. Ms. Tehmina has been a God-send to our family. My older son is now a straight A student at Norton and is in the AIM (Talented and GIfted) program. His study skills have been honed so well during his 4-year stay at this school. We have kept our younger son at AMA for kindergarten for the sole purpose of further advancing his academic skills. I highly recommend this school for both its academic and family-oriented environment. Do come by for a visit so you can experience for yourself what other Montessori schools can not of...        </div>
