Every year, all Clovis Municipal Schools employees gather together the Friday before the first day of school for a traditional kick-off bash we call Convocation.
<br><br>
Getting ready for the big event, today, time was taken to stuff 1,200 goodie bags to be handed out to employees at Convocation – a task taken on by Superintendent Renee Russ, Deputy Superintendent of Employee Services Joe Strickland, Laura Adkins, executive director of Language, Culture &amp; At Risk Services and Sharon Garcia and Doris Bolton, from the Student Nutrition department.
<br><br>
A lively event filled with school and department staff proudly wearing spirit t-shirts, at Convocation there are presentations of awards, guest speakers, announcements and an occasional surprise or two, followed by a meal courtesy of Central Baptist Church.
<br><br>
Employees check your email for Convocation details and don’t miss it!
<br><br>
We are looking forward to welcoming all of our employees back and celebrating the start of an amazing school year, see you Friday CMS Team!

PARENTS &amp; GUARDIANS: IMPORTANT LETTER FROM THE STATE REGARDING PROTOCOL IN THE EVENT OF A MEASLES OUTBREAK AT SCHOOL <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Aug. 5, 2019</em> 
<br><br>

Dear Parents,<br><br>
Due to the recent outbreaks of measles in the United States, we are writing you to make you aware of some important details. If there is a measles case in your child’s school, your child may not be able to attend school until the outbreak ends, if they have not been immunized against the disease.
<br><br>
Measles is one of the most contagious of all infectious diseases; up to 9 out of 10 susceptible persons exposed will develop measles. A single case of the measles can quickly spiral into an outbreak, because people may not know they have the illness (and are spreading it) for several days before they begin to show rash symptoms. The measles virus is spread by direct contact with infectious respiratory droplets when the infected person coughs, breathes, or sneezes.
<br><br>
The measles virus can remain infectious in the environment for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves the area. The length of incubation from exposure to measles virus to symptom development is 7 to 21 days. The telltale rash occurs on average 14 days after exposure, and 4 days after symptoms first appear.
<br><br>
If there is an outbreak of measles in New Mexico and your child is not immunized against the disease, all schools will be encouraged to follow the protocol recommended by the New Mexico Department of Health and the CDC, which states your child will not be allowed to attend classes for at least 42 days (the length of two incubation periods) following the last known case. Additionally, your school will likely not permit unimmunized students to travel on any school-sponsored activity to other states, countries, or areas in New Mexico that have had outbreaks of measles.
<br><br>
In order to ensure that your child will be able to attend school or travel on school-sponsored trips in the event of an outbreak of measles in NM, or other areas, your child must have received two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). After receiving the first dose, there is a minimum 28 day waiting period until a second dose can be administered. Documentation that those immunizations were given must be provided to your school nurse or administrator.
<br><br>
If you need information about where this vaccine can be obtained at no cost to you, please contact your child’s primary care physician, your local Public Health Office or the Immunization Program at 505-827-2356 or toll free 1-833-882-6454, and we will be happy to provide this information to you.
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
The Immunization Program<br><br><br><div align="center">

PARKVIEW STAFF MEET FOR 90-DAY PLANNING <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Aug. 2, 2019</em> 
<br><br>
This week, teachers met with new Parkview Principal Carrie Geisler and Dr. Shelly Norris, Executive Director of Educator Quality, to begin working on 90-day planning for the coming school year.
<br><br>
Clovis Municipal Schools introduced 90-Day Planning last school year.<br><br>

On a designated date, approximately every 45 days of the school year, a work day is set aside to conduct data meetings regarding district common formative assessments, provide instructional staff an opportunity to develop, review and modify 90-Day Plans, and collaborate and use data to plan for instruction.
<br><br>
Grown from the New Mexico Public Education Department’s Principals Pursuing Excellence (PPE) program, each of our schools have developed 90-Day Plans. A 90-Day Plan includes specific focus areas and action steps to address changes in that have been identified through data analysis.
<br><br>
Flexible, living plans designed to be modified and adaptable, each plan requires 30 and 60-day monitoring. Additionally, each school-level 90-Day Plan Team includes a district-level representative, and district PPE certified mentors provide ongoing monitoring and support for plan development and implementation.

<br><br>

To-date, we have hired 76 new teachers to join us for the 2019-2020 school year, and we are ecstatic to welcome them aboard!
<br><br>
Gearing up for the year can be an exhausting process, especially for our new teachers as they become acquainted with instruction processes, expectations and begin the task of preparing to welcome students in just over a week.
<br><br>
This week our new teachers attended three days of training and orientation designed to aid them as they transition into their new positions with Clovis Municipal Schools. In addition to preparing for their work in the classroom, during these days, teachers receive laptops, set up their accounts and receive training on software they will use. Beyond those things, they learn about behavior and classroom management, support services available to them and go over in-depth instruction topics.
<br><br>
It can be a lot to take in, but our new teachers are enthusiastic and taking on the challenge with style.
<br><br>
Welcome to you all, we appreciate your hard work and are looking forward to a great year with you on our team!<br><br><div align="center">

Every year, there are changes to laws and regulations as well as internal policies and procedures, and this year is no different. District leaders meet regularly throughout the year to share new information with one another, but special emphasis is placed on these meetings at the start of the year.
<br><br>
Gathering new and old colleagues together to share ideas, inform of changes and talk about objectives for the coming year often feels more like a reunion than a meeting. Presentations are given from support departments, questions are asked and notes compared – all in the interest of getting the year off to a good start.
<br><br>
Whatever area or department they work in, there is no question that this team of professionals guiding the district into 2019-2020 has one thing on their minds – it’s all about the kids!

CAPTURING KID’S HEARTS BEGINS LONG BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted July 31, 2019</em> 
<br><br>


This week staff from Clovis Municipal Schools had the opportunity to attend a full-day professional development session on “Capturing Kid’s Hearts,” conducted by the Flippen Group, who created the concept. The training was held at the Clovis Civic Center.
<br><br>
Capturing Kid’s Hearts is a program concept drawn on the idea that students come to school carrying with them the challenges of their lives outside of school while tasked with learning. By capturing hearts, staff work to show students they matter and build sincere, trusting relationships that enable them to achieve goals in the classroom because they know they matter to their teachers and are supported.
<br><br>
According to Flippen, “When kids and teachers are connected, there is a significant positive transformational effect on the 5 key indicators of school performance:<br><br><ul>1. Decreased Discipline Referrals<br>
2. Increased Student Achievement<br>
3. Increased Attendance Rates<br>
4. Increased Graduation Rates<br>
5. Increased Teacher Satisfaction</ul>
<br><br>
  
Our district is committed to cultivating those transformational connections with our students so that they always know they have a huge team of dedicated professionals who genuinely care about them and want them to succeed!
<br><br>
Enjoy the rest of summer break and know we are working hard to make this the best year yet for our students – see you August 12!

AT CLOVIS MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS OUR SECRETARIES KEEP US GOING! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted July 31, 2019</em> 
<br><br>

This week all secretaries from around the district are gathered for two days of intensive meetings and training to prepare them for the coming school year. 

<br><br>
An annual event that takes place before school begins, in addition to hearing about new procedures and processes, the full-day sessions are an opportunity for secretarial staff to get valuable information on how to conduct the many processes they are responsible for. Periodically throughout the two-day event, principals and other staff join secretaries in the sessions.

<br><br>
This year, our secretarial staff, which accept payments and manage budgets and purchases, heard from a special guest, State Auditor Brian S. Colón. Colón delivered a personable and entertaining presentation addressing financial functions in context with responsible fund management. 

<br><br>
The training session continues today, as our staff prepare to open our schools to the public for administrative services on August 2. 

<br><br>
Next time you see one of our secretaries, make sure to let them know all their hard work is appreciated, because we know they make our district work, and we couldn’t do it without them!

PRESCHOOL-12TH GRADE: IF YOUR STUDENT/S WILL ATTEND OUR SCHOOLS THIS YEAR, WE NEED TO KNOW – ENROLL ONLINE TODAY! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted July 25, 2019</em> 
<br><br>

This an exciting time of year for us because we are hard at work planning for the start of school, setting schedules, placing teachers and assigning students to classrooms. If you have not already enrolled your student/s, please do so online. Knowing who will be attending helps us get ready for them and organize our classrooms!
<br><br>
Preschool through 12th grade – School enrollment is conducted for online via Skyward Family Access, the district’s student database and primary means of communication with families.
<br><br>
Parents &amp; guardians of all students planning to attend a school in the district in 2019-2020 will either need to complete a full online enrollment, or, an information verification for existing students no later than August 8.
<br><br>
NOTE: Classroom assignments &amp; schedules are announced in Skyward before school begins. If your student has not been enrolled online, you will not be able to see their teacher/s or schedules for the coming year.

<ul>TO GET STARTED<br><br>
1. Visit: www.clovis-schools.org/registration.html<br>
2. Select the appropriate type of enrollment for your situation<br>
3. Follow the instructions and/or prompts to complete enrollment<br>
A help guide is available at: http://www.clovis-schools.org/regist…/Registration_Help.html</ul>

Please note: Enrollment is NOT available in the Skyward App and must be completed via web browser. Also, some users may experience difficulty enrolling using a smartphone or mobile device. In those cases, use of a computer is recommended.<br><br>

For families without computer or Internet access, computers are available at the Clovis Municipal Schools Administrative Offices, 1009 Main Street.<br><br>

Information: 575-769-4300<br><br>

The online enrollment system is divided into three scenarios:
<br><br>
--NEW FAMILY ENROLLMENT--<br><br>
Families NEW to the district who:<br><br>
1. DO NOT have Skyward Family Access<br>
and<br><br>
2. Are enrolling one or more students in Clovis Municipal Schools who were either previously withdrawn or are attending district schools for the first time
<br><br>
Example 1 – Your family is moving to the area from another state and you are enrolling your children.
<br><br>
Example 2 – Your child attended school in Clovis but transferred to another district to attend school there and will now return to attend Clovis Municipal Schools.
<br><br>
--NEW STUDENT REGISTRATION (NEW STUDENT, EXISTING FAMILY ENROLLMENT)--<br><br>
Families who have an existing Skyward Family Access account and who are adding/enrolling a new student.<br><br>

Example 1 – Your family has a child in third grade and will be enrolling a younger sibling in kindergarten this year.<br><br>

Example 2 – Your family has a child enrolled in Clovis Municipal Schools and a sibling who was living elsewhere will be moving to Clovis to live with your family and attend school next year.<br><br>

--RETURNING STUDENT VERIFICATION--<br><br>
Families who have an existing Skyward Family Access account and whose students completed the prior school year with active enrollment status and will return for 2019-2020 must verify enrollment information each year.<br><br>

Example – Each year families are asked to verify and update contact, address, emergency contact and other information by their child’s school. From now on, that will be done online via Skyward Family Access each school year.<br><br>

We are so excited to have 27 nominations submitted for Support Staff Member and Teacher of the Year that we just had to share their names!<br><br>

It’s unfortunate there can be only one Support Staff Member and Teacher of the year, especially when all of our nominees are outstanding members of the CMS families.<br><br>

With that in mind, we thought it was important that they know someone thought enough of them to put their name in the hat, and we hope if you see them, you will take the time to congratulate them for being exemplary!<br><br>

At the end of each school year, Clovis Municipal Schools asks for nominations for Support Staff Member of the Year and Teacher of the Year. Nominations are then reviewed and a selection is made for each category. The winners are announced at the district’s Convocation ceremony, an annual kick-off celebration for staff, which is held before the first day of school.<br><br>

HOW IT WORKS – COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION = FREE MEALS FOR QUALIFYING SCHOOLS! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted July 12, 2019</em> 
<br><br>
Continuously seeking ways to offer our students and community as much support as possible, several years ago, Clovis Municipal Schools began participating in Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), a federally funded program offered by the USDA which allows schools in high poverty communities to offer free meals for all students.
<br><br>
As a federal program, USDA criteria to qualify for CEP funding is based on the demographics of a given school zone, particularly, the number of residents who receive federal benefits including TANF, SNAP, and Medicaid. Additional factors considered are students identified as homeless, Head Start participants, foster and migrant children. In school zones where the number of students classified as or qualifying for these benefits represent a majority of the student population, the USDA compensates school districts for the cost of meal programs so students can be offered nutritional meals at no cost.
<br><br>
According to the USDA, “The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) is a non-pricing meal service option for schools and school districts in low-income areas. CEP allows the nation’s highest poverty schools and districts to serve breakfast and lunch at no cost to all enrolled students without collecting household applications.
<br><br>
Instead, schools that adopt CEP are reimbursed using a formula based on the percentage of students categorically eligible for free meals based on their participation in other specific means-tested programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).”
<br><br>
Clovis Municipal Schools has been fortunate to be able to utilize the CEP program, providing free meals to the students at 11 of the 17 schools in our district.
<br><br>
For students at the remaining 6 schools that do not qualify for CEP, free and reduced meals are available to individual families who qualify by submitting an application. Additionally, the district has taken steps to assist students and families with the cost of meals by offering free breakfast to all students at all schools. In the case of students who qualify for reduced meal prices, the district also absorbs the price difference, offering those students free meals.
<br><br>
Supporting our students and addressing the needs and challenges faced by our families is an ongoing priority for Clovis Municipal Schools and we are committed to continually pursuing resources to that end while acting as responsible stewards of tax dollars.

Between the hours of 4 and 7:30 p.m. June 23, two individuals entered Mesa Elementary School.

Surveillance footage captured by security cameras shows what appear to be two juvenile males entering and exiting the building several times over an approximately three hour period.

Mesa Elementary, located at 4801 Norris Street in north Clovis, is currently under construction and is closed to the public.
<br><br>
This incident is an opportunity to remind children that construction areas are not safe areas to play in, and they should never enter an area where construction or utility work is taking place.
<br><br>
Additionally, during holidays or seasonal breaks, unless otherwise announced or posted, school buildings are closed to the public and entering is unlawful unless previous arrangements have been made with the school district.
<br><br>
***UPDATE: This incident has been addressed with the appropriate individuals. Having aided in that resolution, A video footage previously posted is no longer needed for identification and has been removed.***

Local businesses are usually the first to be targeted for solicitation from third-party agencies or organizations stating they are raising funds on behalf of the students and/or staff of Clovis Municipal Schools.<br><br>

If you are a business owner and encounter solicitations of this type, the agency or organization is not raising funds on our behalf. Clovis Municipal Schools does not endorse or support solicitations by non-school third parties.<br><br>

When funding solicitation is necessary for district clubs, organizations, athletic programs, advertising events, or individual schools, the requests will come directly from an employee or student of the district.<br><br>

Do not give money to anyone for school use unless you are confident that (s)he is either an employee or student of the District and is authorized to solicit funds.<br><br>

If you believe someone is inappropriately soliciting money on behalf of Clovis Municipal Schools, please contact the Superintendent's Office at 575-769-4320.

        </div>    <br>

Clovis High School Air Force Junior ROTC (AFJROTC) cadet, Jason Garten(12th), recently received a Flight Academy scholarship to attend a private pilot's license training program this summer.
<br><br>
Valued at approximately $20,000, the scholarship covers transportation, room and board, academics, and flight hours required to potentially earn a private pilot's license from an accredited aviation university.<br><br>
Jason is among 150 to be awarded a scholarship nationwide, of more than 1,560 AFJROTC cadets who applied and is the only recipient from New Mexico.
<br><br>
The Flight Academy Scholarship Program, in collaboration with the commercial
aviation industry, is an Air Force-level initiative to address the national civilian and military pilot shortage. AFJROTC has been charged by the Air Force Aircrew
Crisis Task Force to bring back the “luster of aviation” to high school students and increase diversity in aviation fields.
<br><br>
Students who participate in the program do not incur a military commitment to the Air
Force or other branch of service, nor does completing the program guarantee acceptance into one of the military’s commissioning programs.
<br><br>
The mission of AFJROTC is to develop citizens of character dedicated to serving their nation and community, while instilling values of citizenship, service to the United States, personal responsibility and sense of accomplishment. When looking to fill tomorrow’s career needs with the best candidates, there is simply no better place for the nation to look than AFJROTC!<br><br>

For more information on the AFJROTC Flight Academy Scholarship Program, please contact the Maxwell AFB Public Affairs Office at maxwellmediarelations@us.af.mil.<br><br><div align="center"> <a href="Press%20Releases/2019/1-18-19AFROTC%20FLIGHT%20ACADEMY%202019.pdf" target="_blank">| Press Release |</a> </div>

Monday, Christmas gifts were given to about 250 families of Clovis Municipal Schools students, donated by Airmen from Cannon Air Force Base.
<br><br>
The 27th Special Operations Force Support Squadron at Cannon Air Force Base worked with CMS Family Services liaisons to identify families within the school district who were in need of Christmas gifts.
<br><br>
The gifts were distributed from the gymnasium at Lincoln-Jackson Family Center.
<br><br>
Cannon estimated between 650-700 people were provided gifts, including some that were delivered to local children's homes and schools in Portales.
<br><br>
Federal Programs Deputy Director Renee Russ said the effort was a huge undertaking and everyone involved worked hard to make it happen, motivated by being able to offer support to families and make sure they have a good Christmas.
<br><br>
Russ said this was the first year Cannon and the schools have partnered to provide Christmas for families and they plan to make it an annual event.

At its regular meeting Tuesday, Highland Elementary students Marley Lucero and Gracie Polk, led the Curry County Commission in reciting the United States Pledge of Allegiance and New Mexico pledge.
<br><br>

Designed to give students first-hand experience in government, under a cooperative arrangement between Curry County and Clovis Municipal Schools, elementary schools in the district take turns leading the pledge at meetings each month, with each participating school selecting students to serve as representatives.

<br><br>
It was the second month students from Clovis Municipal Schools attended meetings and led the pledges. In November, Zia Elementary students Xochilt Garcia, Reid Adams and Cooper Knauer were the first student representatives to attend a commission meeting.

MESA ELEMENTARY FOURTH GRADE TEACHER SILVIA MIRANDA WINS NATIONAL, $25,000 MILKEN EDUCATOR AWARD <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Nov. 21, 2018</em> 
        </div>    <br>
Silvia Miranda was presented with the prestigious Milken Educator Award in a surprise announcement made during an impromptu assembly at Mesa Elementary School Tuesday. Presented by Milken Educator Awards Senior Vice President Dr. Jane Foley and New Mexico Education Secretary Christopher Ruszkowski, Miranda joins an elite group of up to 40 educators across the nation to receive the award in 2018-2019. <br><br>
The national recognition comes with an unrestricted $25,000 cash prize. She is the only Milken Educator Award winner from New Mexico this year.  <br><br>
Of the things that made her stand out as a Milken Educator Award candidate was the fact Miranda holds herself and her students to the highest standards and insists that every student succeed. She incorporates Whole Brain strategies and a growth mindset philosophy in her classroom and encourages students to pursue their interests. An experienced bilingual educator, Miranda prepares students for the district's Spanish spelling bee. She launched a Bananagrams tournament during lunch and organized the Mesa Science Fair for fourth- and fifth-graders, bringing in more than 20 judges from nearby Cannon Air Force Base and Clovis Community College. Miranda helped write Mesa's National Blue Ribbon Award application and traveled to Washington with her principal to receive the school's award. <br><br>
"On behalf of Clovis Municipal Schools, I would like to congratulate Sylvia Miranda and the entire Mesa staff and students for Silvia receiving New Mexico's Milken Educator Award, said Superintendent of Clovis Municipal Schools Jody Balch. "Silvia is a very gifted teacher as evidenced by effective instructional practices and student learning results in her classroom. Silvia would be the first to recognize her fantastic students and her peers for her ongoing teaching success. This award is fantastic for our district and the community of Clovis." <br><br>
"All-around, all-star educators like Silvia Miranda have a knack for bringing out the best in students and colleagues with their drive, their insight, their innovation and their heart," said Foley. "We're proud to welcome her as a Milken Educator."
"Ms. Silvia Miranda is without question, as evidenced by her students' academic growth, one of New Mexico's highest-performing teachers" said Ruszkowski. She has demonstrated brilliance in her craft and is a testament to the transformative power of excellent teaching in our students' lives." <br><br>
Milken Educators are selected in early to mid-career for what they have achieved and for the promise of what they will accomplish. In addition to the $25,000 prize and public recognition, the honor includes membership in the National Milken Educator Network, a group of more than 2,700 top teachers, principals and specialists dedicated to strengthening education. <br><br>
The Milken Educator Awards, hailed by Teacher magazine as the "Oscars of Teaching" has been opening minds and shaping futures for over 30 years. Research shows teacher quality is the driving in-school factor behind student growth and achievement. The initiative not only aims to reward great teachers, but to celebrate, elevate and activate those innovators in the classroom who are guiding America's next generation of leaders. Milken Educators believe, "The future belongs to the educated." <br><br>

        </div>    <br>

Friday, students from the Clovis High School National Honor Society collected boxes filled with canned food donations from a food drive that started Tuesday.<br><br>

In all, the collection boxes amassed more than 500 lbs of food, which was turned over to the Clovis Salvation Army to be distributed to people in the community.<br><br>

The effort took several hours and involved a good bit of hard work but the students were enthusiastic and excited to do something to help people in our community.<br><br>

WAY TO MAKE US PROUD WILDCAT NHS MEMBERS!<br><br>

At the close of the 2017-2018 school year, the CHS chapter of the National Honor Society inducted 79 new members, bringing their total to 251 honors scholars.<br><br>

According to the National Honor Society, "The National Honor Society (NHS) is the nation’s premier organization established to recognize outstanding high school students. More than just an honor roll, NHS serves to recognize those students who have demonstrated excellence in the areas of scholarship, service, leadership, and character. These characteristics have been associated with membership in the organization since its beginning in 1921."<br><br>

CLOVIS MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS TO OFFER LIMITED NUMBER OF FREE FLU SHOTS TO STUDENTS IN NOVEMBER <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Nov. 2, 2018</em> 
        </div>    <br>

Clovis Municipal Schools is offering flu vaccines for student free of charge. Due to limited supply, the vaccines will be offered first to elementary students, then middle schools, the Clovis High School Freshman Academy, then finally to Clovis High School students.
<br><br>
This is possible through New Mexico Department of Health, School Kids Influenza Immunization Project (SKIIP), which has provided the District with 750 flu vaccines. Because supplies are limited, shots will be given on a first-come-first-serve basis while supplies last, with priority given to elementary students.
<br><br>
The flu immunizations will be administered at schools, during the school day beginning the week of November 12. Insurance is not required, and there is no cost to families, however families with insurance are asked to provide their insurance information for internal purposes.
<br><br>
Parent consent forms were recently sent home with elementary, middle school and CHS Freshman Academy students. To receive a flu shot, completed parent consent forms must be returned to school by the following dates:

<ul>
<li> Wednesday, November 7<br>
Elementary students

</li>
<li> Tuesday, November 13<br>
Middle School &amp; Freshman Academy students

</li>
<li> Tuesday, November 13<br>
*Clovis High School students</li>
</ul>

*Consents were not sent home with Clovis High School students. They can be obtained in the Clovis High School Nursing Office.

Wednesday, about 80 elementary students at the Academy of Arts at Bella Vista got a special reward for their AWESOME 1st nine weeks attendance records!
<br><br>
Offered for the first time this year, earning the reward was no easy task and the students had to meet stringent criteria to make it to the desert buffet – not only did they have to be at school every day, they had to be on time every single day and not be picked up early for the first nine weeks of school!

Some Sandia Elementary students were elbows deep in pumpkins Wednesday, while others tried to guess pumpkin weight, painted gourds and toured a long line of tables featuring creative pumpkin submissions from fellow students.
<br><br>
Oh, and of course there were treats!

Probably a weird day to be a pumpkin, but an AWESOME day to be a BULLDOG!

THIRTEEN CLOVIS SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOLASTIC FAMILY ENGAGEMENT SURVEY!! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Oct. 26, 2018</em> 
        </div>    <br>
Families of students at 13 schools in the Clovis Municipal Schools District are being asked to participate in a survey being launched through the Scholastic Family and Community Engagement (FACE) program.
<br><br>
The purpose of the survey is to better understand the family experience as it relates to the education environment and to explore the relationships parents and families have with the schools their student/s attend. Scholastic surveys will also be conducted with school administrators and staff in order to provide a full perspective. Expected to conclude by January 2019, the survey will be available soon.
<br><br>
Access instructions for the online survey will be sent to families via email and Skyward Family Access. Asked to complete one survey for each school where they have an enrolled student, families also have the option of completing a printed survey, available at their school.
<br><br>
Participating schools are:
<ul>
Arts Academy at Bella Vista<br>
Cameo Elementary<br>
Highland Elementary<br>
James Bickley Elementary<br>
La Casita Elementary<br>
Lockwood Elementary<br>
Parkview Elementary<br>
Sandia Elementary<br>
Gattis Middle School<br>
Marshall Middle School<br>
Yucca Middle School<br>
Clovis High School Freshman Academy<br>
Clovis High School
</ul>

The information provided by families is a critical part of the District’s ongoing efforts to make families feel like welcome participants and ensure the education of our community’s children is accomplished through a home and school partnership.
<br><br>
Recently, Clovis Municipal Schools selected education industry leader Scholastic to conduct an in-depth assessment of family engagement at the District’s Title I schools. Title I is a designation applied to schools by the federal Title I program, which seeks to enrich opportunities for economically disadvantaged communities. Of the 17 schools in the District, 13 are designated Title I.
<br><br>
Upon completion of the assessment and thorough analysis of the results, Scholastic FACE experts will provide the District with reports of findings and quantitative data establishing a baseline for ongoing improvement measurements. FACE experts will also provide staff, administrators and school Family Engagement Team members three days of professional development to develop intensive understanding of guiding family engagement principles and practices integrated with the District’s individual assessment results.
<br><br>
For additional information about our Family Engagement Assessment, please contact Renee Russ, Deputy Director of Federal Programs, 575-769-4328.

Today our principals gathered at the Administration Office for a regular monthly meeting. Since October is National Principals Month, it seemed like as good a time as any to pose for a family photo!
<br><br>
Of course they could only contain their enthusiasm for so long... leaving us with one composed, and one fun photo – not that we mind.
<br><br>
When you get a chance, take a minute to thank one these hard working folks!
<br><br>
p.s. It doesn't just have to be in October, any month will work.
<br><br>
"National Principals Month recognizes the essential role that principals play in making a school great. Each October, the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), and the American Federation of School Administrators (AFSA)honor these unsung heroes for their tireless efforts in pursuit of excellence in education," – <em>The NASSP, NAESP, and AFSA</em><br><br>

CLOVIS HIGH SCHOOL AFJROTC ATTENDS MOCK BASIC MILITARY TRAINING! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Oct. 22, 2018</em>

On October 19, Clovis High School Air Force Junior ROTC (AFJROTC) cadets attended a Mock Basic Military Training (BMT) at Cannon Air Force Base to experience what military members endure during basic training.
<br><br>
The full-day event included a tour of various squadrons where cadets had an opportunity to talk with CAFB Airmen and ask questions about jobs they may be interested in pursuing such as Fire Protection, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and aircraft maintenance as well as receive instruction and indoctrination given by former United States Air Force (USAF) Military Training Instructors (MTI’s). One more stop on the tour was the CV-22 Osprey hangar.
<br><br>
Experiences such as these are essential to prepare a cadet for a future career in the military, gain an inside perspective about military life, and learn about the mission of the USAF.
<br><br>
A special thanks to the Airmen of the 27th Special Operations Wing for the invaluable training.

THREE CLOVIS MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS TEACHERS NAMED FINALISTS FOR 2019 GOLDEN APPLE AWARD! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Oct. 22, 2018</em> 
        </div>    <br>

Three elementary teachers from Clovis Schools have been selected as 2019 finalists for the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching.
<br><br>
Of the over 300 nominations, Shelly Grim and Christi Hartley (Arts Academy at Bella Vista) and Roxanne Mitchell (Sandia Elementary School) were selected as finalists.
<br><br>
The Golden Apple Foundation of New Mexico (GAFNM) exists to improve the quality of education across New Mexico through the recognition, recruitment and professional development of outstanding teachers.
<br><br>
Nominations are collected from teachers, students, administrators, parents and the community to create a pool of worthy candidates for this prestigious award. Nominations are then reviewed and scored multiple times and last week a team of educators came to Clovis for a classroom visits.
<br><br>
In the spring 2019, the GAFNM will honor seven of the sixteen elementary school teacher finalists (grades preK-5) at the Gold Apple Tribute to Teacher Excellence.
<br><br>
Recipients will receive a $1,500 cash prize and a $4,000 professional development account.

This school year, Clovis Municipal Schools has chosen to work with Scholastic Family and Community Engagement experts to conduct an assessment – looking at what we’re doing right, and what we need to do better – and to help teach us how to build better partnerships with our families.
<br><br>

Dr. Karen Mapp is a senior lecturer on education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) who has devoted her career to helping schools foster stronger family engagement.
<br><br>
While initially, it may sound like the responsibility for family engagement falls on the shoulders of families, Dr. Mapp would disagree. Schools and educators may know family engagement is important, but they don’t always know how to accomplish it, how to make families feel welcome and how to build relationships – sometimes we need to be taught too. 
<br><br>
Not only will Scholastic conduct school walk-through evaluations and procedure and practice reviews at all 13 of our Title I schools (see the press release for an explanation), they want to hear what our families have to say.
<br><br>
To make sure your perspective is heard, in the near future, we will be asking our families to complete surveys – watch for the announcement!
<br><br>
And when all the research and assessing is done, our Family Engagement Teams (made up of administrators, staff, parents and community members) will receive three-day professional development training series based on research and strategies developed by, you guessed it, Dr. Karen Mapp.

CLOVIS MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS HIGHLIGHTS ELEMENTARY VISUAL ARTS INSTRUCTION! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Oct. 12, 2018</em> 
        </div>    <br><div align="left">
Recognizing the importance of creative expression through visual arts, this school year, Clovis Municipal Schools has made great strides in expanded opportunities for our elementary students to explore and create art.
<br><br>
Elementary parents were asked to complete a survey in the spring of 2018, to assist the district in evaluating and improving our art offerings. While parents expressed a high level of satisfaction with existing programs, particularly music and performing arts, they wanted to see more growth and activity in the visual arts. In response, the Instruction Department and district Fine Arts Committee evaluated available funding for the arts and were able to allocate resources to ensure all kindergarten through fifth grade students receive time dedicated to the visual arts.
<br><br>
This was accomplished by dedicating a team of three teachers, specializing in the visual arts, to rotate through each elementary school during the school year. By adding staff exclusively for the purpose of elementary visual arts instruction, our district has been able to not only increase the amount, but also the quality of art instruction.
<br><br>
To showcase the work being done by our elementary students under the tutelage of our visual arts team, the district has installed a display case in the lobby of the Clovis Municipal Schools Administration Office, located at 1009 Main Street. Rotating monthly, the display features examples of the outstanding artwork created by kindergarten through fifth grade students around the district.
<br><br>
Parents and community members are welcome to stop by and view student works between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<br><br>
Clovis Municipal Schools receives and annual state grant for elementary arts programs through the New Mexico Fine Arts Education Act. Averaging approximately $1 million each year, the funds support regular classroom music and visual arts instruction. Additionally, supplemental programs are also offered to elementary students throughout the school year, such as experiencing professional music and theater performances, biennial participation in the Missoula Children’s Theatre and individual school programs.
<br><br>
For more information about Clovis Municipal Schools’ fine arts education programs, contact our Instruction Department at 575-769-4321.<br><br>

Regardless your education plans, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is something all students and their parents should complete.
<br><br>
Not only is the FAFSA the key to receiving funding such as a Pell Grant and federal student loans, FAFSA applications are used by accredited academic and vocational post-secondary schools to determine who receives state and local scholarships, even for those who may not qualify for income-based aid!
<br><br>
Opened October 1, the 2019-2020 FAFSA is available online. The process is fairly straightforward and income information can even be imported from IRS records, however a mistake can have a lasting impact and take months to correct.
<br><br>
If you are uncertain of where to begin, are experiencing difficulties or just want a little guidance in completing the FAFSA, help is available!

ATTENDANCE MATTERS: HEAR THE MIX 107.5 INTERVIEW WITH GATTIS STUDENT SUCCESS COACH A.T. MOORE! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Oct. 9, 2018</em> 
            <br>
Perhaps there's no one to sit with at lunch, or a student doesn't think their teachers like them... at Clovis Municipal Schools, we understand that as educators we need to ask "why?" so we can address the root issues that cause a student not to attend school.
<br><br>
In this radio broadcast, A.T. Moore, our Student Success Coach at Gattis Middle School, talks with the Mix Morning crew on Mix 107.5 about the proactive approaches we are taking to address attendance issues.
<br><br>
Fresh perspectives on finding ways to help students want to be in school are replacing the sometimes short-sighted, punitive approaches of the past as the district moves to capture kids hearts and turn learning into an investment shared by staff and students.
<br><br>
Thank you Mix 107.5 for helping us share information with the community!

NATIONAL CLOTHING CORPORATION DONATES TO HIGHLAND ELEMENTARY FOR MAKERSPACE SUPPLIES! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted October 3, 2018</em> 
            <br>
The national clothing retailer Maurices has gifted Highland Elementary with $100 to pay for supplies for their new Makerspace!
<br><br>
The gift is the result of a national “Adopt a Classroom” program in which Maurices customers elect to make a donation when making a purchase at the store. The funds were then divided and donated to community schools around the country.
<br><br>
A Makerspace is an area dedicated to student innovation and hands-on learning. In these spaces, students are able to build and create, often with the aid of technology. At Highland, a centralized Makerspace will be made accessible to all students to provide them the opportunity to learn and explore through innovation and hands-on creativity.
<br><br>
Makerspace’s are currently being piloted in three of our elementary schools, Barry, Highland and Mesa elementary schools as an enrichment aid that gives students opportunity for visualization, building, problem solving and implementation of ideas.
<br><br>
THANK YOU MAURICES FOR SELECTING OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, FOR HELPING HIGHLAND STUDENTS GET OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE HANDS-ON LEARNING!
<br><br>
Clovis Municipal Schools is grateful for such an act of generosity and for the ongoing thoughtfulness and care shown to the staff and students of our school community.

CURIOUS ABOUT 90-DAY PLANNING DAYS? CHECK OUT THIS NEWS STORY – AND REMEMBER, NO SCHOOL FOR STUDENTS NEXT TUESDAY! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted October 2, 2018</em> 
            <br>

A week ago, we announced our new 90-Day Planning initiative designed to give our teachers and administrators time to evaluate data and structure lessons in ways that enrich instruction.
<br><br>
Our first 90-Day Planning Day will next Tuesday, October 9. On this day, which coincides with our Fall Break (Oct. 5-8), students will not attend school, however staff will report to work as usual, providing a full day for data analysis and planning.
<br><br>
Two other 90-Day Planning Days will be held this year on Jan. 9 and March 13. On those days, students will not attend school but staff will report to work.
<br><br>
ABC 7 Amarillo recently featured the initiative, speaking with Joe Strickland, our Deputy Superintendent of Instruction, and Gattis Middle School Principal Gloria Mendoza-Christensen about what 90-Day Planning days are and how they can impact student success.
<br><br>
Check it out!

CMS NEWS OCT. 2, 2018: STUDENT ID CARDS &amp; DISPLAY LANYARDS ISSUED TO CLOVIS HIGH SCHOOL &amp; CHS FRESHMAN ACADEMY STUDENTS <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted October 2, 2018</em> 
            <br>
In the ongoing interest of maintaining safe and secure campuses, Clovis High School and Clovis High School Freshman Academy have issued photo ID cards and lanyards to students with the expectation they display their identification while on campus.
<br><br>
Displaying clear and easily verifiable identification aids school staff in quickly identifying individuals on school grounds and their purpose for being there.
<br><br>
Already, Clovis Municipal Schools requires all employees on all campuses to visibly display photo ID badges, and visitors are issued temporary badges to identify them and the purpose for their visit.
<br><br>
Expanding this practice to include students on our high school campuses, where there are large, highly mobile and active student populations, is a logical and necessary next step in the effort to make our schools more secure.
<br><br>
By displaying photo ID cards, campus staff can easily and effectively ascertain whether someone should be on campus. Additionally, photo ID cards offer a fast reference, which can expedite response and resolution by enabling staff to quickly and accurately identify students who may
experience medical episodes and other types of emergency situations.
<br><br>
Cards and lanyards are provided to students free of charge. Should a card be lost or damaged a replacement will be provided at a cost of $5.
<br><br>
If you are a parent or guardian of a student at one of these campuses and have questions regarding this new procedure, please contact the administration at the appropriate campus. Media inquiries should be directed to the Superintendent's Office.

CLOVIS MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS INTRODUCES 90-DAY PLANNING DAYS <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted September 26, 2018</em> 
            <br>

This school year, as part of our state partnerships and ongoing dedication to growth and student success, Clovis Municipal Schools is introducing 90-Day Plan days. On a designated date, approximately every 45 days of the school year, a work day is set
aside to conduct data meetings regarding district common formative assessments, provide instructional staff an opportunity to develop, review and modify 90-Day Plans, and collaborate and use data to plan for instruction.<br><br>

The three designated 90-Day Plan days for 2018 - 2019 will be:
<ul>October 9, 2018<br>
January 9, 2019<br>
March 13, 2019</ul>

On these dates, district staff will report for work, however, students will not attend school.<br><br>

Grown from the New Mexico Public Education Department’s Principals Pursuing Excellence (PPE) program, each of our schools have developed 90-Day Plans. A 90-Day Plan includes specific focus areas and action steps to address changes in instruction and administrative behavior with the goal of impacting gaps in learning
that have been identified through data analysis.<br><br>

Flexible, living plans designed to be modified and adaptable, each plan requires 30 and 60-day monitoring. Additionally, each school-level 90-Day Plan Team includes a district-level representative, and district PPE certified mentors provide ongoing
monitoring and support for plan development and implementation.<br><br>

Principals Pursuing Excellence is a two-year program aimed at leveraging the expertise of New Mexico’s educational leaders to support and empower New Mexico’s school leaders as they work to dramatically improve student achievement in their schools.

            <br>
The Clovis High School Air Force Junior ROTC (AFJROTC) cadets, trained in Teen Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), will be participating in a statewide CERT Training Rodeo, September 22, at the University of New Mexico Dreamstyle Stadium in Albuquerque.
<br><br>
The Teen CERT Program is a national training program designed for teens who would like to volunteer during a local disaster.
<br><br>
As Teen CERT members, cadets will practice/learn skills such as:

<ul>
<li> Extinguish small fires before they get out of control
</li>
<li> Set up a medical treatment zone after a disaster
</li>
<li> Conduct search and rescue missions
</li>
<li> Assist people injured in an emergency
</li>
<li> Assist responders
</li>
<li> Identify potential hazards
</li>
<li> Reduce the incidence and risk of fire in buildings
</li>
<li> Help calm people so they can cope with disasters</li>
</ul>

The training will also consist of a full-scale simulation with 1,000 victims, 25 of whom will be Clovis High School AFJROTC cadets.
<br><br>
Through this training, cadets have an opportunity to develop skills that are not only a benefit to Clovis and other communities where they may provide volunteer aid, but also skills they will use now and for the rest of their lives.
<br><br>
Wishing our cadets a great trip &amp; awesome training experience!<br><div align="center">

The Family Leadership Institute (FLI) is a multi-faceted education program, which focuses on providing families with knowledge, tools, and inspiration to help their children succeed in school and life. The primary objective of the FLI is to teach parents the art and skills of family leadership in support of academic achievement and life success of both the family and the children as well.
 <br><br>
Through a series of ten modules focusing on leadership in the home, school and community, parents are provided information necessary to enhance their effectiveness as role models for their children. Each FLI work contains a series of lectures, participant discussions, story telling, role-playing, and group and individual activities. Based on survey results, participants find the training useful and valuable. An FLI Graduation/Celebration Ceremony is held at the end of the training.

LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS &amp; DISTRICT STAFF TEAM UP TO GIVE STUDENTS INCENTIVES TO GO TO SCHOOL! <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted Sept. 13, 2018</em> 
            <br>
Last week, staff from our three middle schools, Freshman Academy and high school participated in Attendance Success Initiative training in Albuquerque and spoke about some of the ways our schools are working to strengthen attendance.
 <br><br>
Presenting on behalf of Clovis Municipal Schools, Marshall Student Success Coach Stephanie Parker talked with an audience of educators about partnering with local businesses to provide incentives for students who work to keep their attendance up. 
 <br><br>
Parker announced that this school year, Clovis business owners John and Robyn Snowberger have pledged a budget of $20,000 for attendance incentives!
 <br><br><div align="center">Visit us on Facebook to  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Clovis-Municipal-Schools-District-Offices-587103524649534/" target="_blank">Watch a video </a><br>from the Attendance Success Initiative training in Albuquerque!</div>      <br>
Thank you Snowbergers, and all who partner with us in supporting the children of our community! Clovis Municipal Schools is THRILLED to have the generous support of the community as we work to help our students achieve a lifetime of success!
 <br><br>
The district became a participant of the Attendance Success Initiative this school year in an effort to move beyond strictly addressing truancy and instead, get to the root causes of attendance issues and improve attendance in a way that has lasting, positive impact on student success.
 <br><br>
According to the New Mexico Public Education Department, “The purpose of the Attendance Success Initiative (ASI) is to establish a cohort of Attendance Success Coaches in elementary, middle, and high schools across the state whose role is to work with students, families, communities, schools, and districts to eliminate chronic absenteeism. Comprehensive community and school-based strategies and supports are critical to overcoming the barriers to school attendance faced by students of all ages and in all communities.
 <br><br>
The ASI outlines a tiered system of support that allows for local flexibility and ensures that preventative measures and interventions are exhausted prior to taking punitive action with chronically absent students. The 3-Tier Intervention system is a tool to help reduce chronic absenteeism in schools and districts.”
 <br><br>

The New Mexico Music Educators Association (NMMEA) recently named the Clovis High School Wind Symphony the NMMEA State Honor Band for 2019.
<br><br>
This marks eight times the band has been selected as NMMEA Honor Band, six of which occurred under the direction of symphony Director Bill Allred. Both distinctions are state records.
<br><br>
Recordings were submitted to three out-of-state judges who, by unanimous vote, chose Clovis High School to receive this distinct honor.
<br><br>
The Clovis High School Wind Symphony will perform in Clovis on January 8, 2019, and later that week at the 2019 NMMEA All-State Convention, Popejoy Hall, University of New Mexico campus, in Albuquerque. Information on the Albuquerque performance and times for both concerts will be announced in the fall.
<br><br>
The Wind Symphony would like to thank the Clovis Schools Board of Education, Superintendent, Cabinet Members, CHS administration, CHS Band Boosters, and the community for their continued support of the band program.
<br><br>
Congratulations - you make us proud!<br><br><br><br><div align="center">

How about a scholarship that gets you free pilot training and 12 college credit hours?
<br><br>
There is a new program in AFJROTC that will pay for you to get your Private Pilot license (and college credit) next summer!
<br><br>
Cadets must be enrolled in AF JROTC this school year and be 16 by early next summer to attend.<br><br>

The program is valued at $25,000, there is NO commitment to the Air Force, AF JROTC, or any other institution and they are doubling the program size for summer 2019!
<br><br>
Selected candidates attend one of six universities with an aviation degree program.<br><br>

The application process starts next month. If you are interested it’s not too late to join AF JROTC at Clovis High School! Talk to your guidance counselor and get started today!
<br><br>
This summer, three Clovis High School students completed the program. Next summer it could be you!<br><br><div align="center">

            <br>
Clovis High School Air Force Junior ROTC (AFJROTC) cadets Megan Edwards and Corde' Mailman, 2018 graduates, and James Burroughes (12th), recently received their private pilot's license through Liberty University.<br><br>

Valued at approximately $20,000, James, Megan, and Corde' were among 120 to be awarded the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Scholarship, of more than 750 AFJROTC cadets who applied.<br><br>

The Flight Academy Scholarship Program, in collaboration with the commercial aviation industry, is a new Air Force-level initiative to address the national civilian and military pilot shortage. AFJROTC has been charged by the Air Force Aircrew Crisis Task Force to bring back the “luster of aviation” to high school students and increase diversity in aviation fields.<br><br>

Students who participate in the program do not incur a military commitment to the Air Force or other branch of service, nor does completing the program guarantee acceptance into one of the military’s commissioning programs.<br><br>

The mission of AFJROTC is to develop citizens of character dedicated to serving their nation and community, while instilling values of citizenship, service to the United States, personal responsibility and sense of accomplishment.<br><br><div align="center">

            <br>

It’s a busy time of year for district leadership as they prepare for the start of school.
<br><br>
This week, our leadership kicked off their activities by gathering for a professional development session designed to get everybody motivated and prepared as they start the 2018-2019 school year.
<br><br>
The theme of the session was “Water the Bamboo, Unleashing the Potential of Teams and Individuals” a leadership concept by professional trainer Greg Bell.
<br><br>
"Water the Bamboo", a metaphor created from giant timber bamboo farming practices, teaches leaders that, “success is fueled by creating unshakable motivation and persistence, developing laser-like focus to avoid distractions, and being fully committed to pursuing your goal.”
<br><br>
As you visit our campuses this year, you may notice our leadership personnel have small bamboo plants in their offices, a takeaway reminder that nurture, commitment and perseverance leads to big results.
<br><br>
We are excited and honored to serve Clovis families and students in 2018-2019. See you at school!

CMSI INITIATIVE TEAM ATTENDING SUMMER EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AT UVA <br><img src="Templates/images/L-CMS-news.png" alt="CMS Logo" width="25"><em class="noteText">posted June 12, 2018</em> 
            <br>
This week, members of the Clovis Municipal Schools Initiative (#CMSI) team are attending a residential executive development program at the Darden School of Business on the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia. During this immersive experience the team is focusing on igniting change for both organizational structure and leadership practice.
<br><br>
During the six-day program the CMSI leadership team is working together to:
<br><br><ul>• UNDERSTAND ROOT CAUSE NEEDS<br>
• LAUNCH ORGANIZATION CHANGE EFFORTS<br>
• LEARN HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS WITH IMPROVED DATA ANALYSIS<br>
• ESTABLISH FOCUSED EXECUTION PLANS<br>
• CREATE A LEARNING ORGANIZATION THAT CAN CONTINUOUSLY ADAPT TO CHANGING NEEDS.</ul>
<br>
The intent of this summer program is to encourage honest conversations and higher levels of trust between the district turnaround leadership team and principals as they cooperate to create and sustain change in targeted schools.

            <br>
An unprecedented total of 68 students received bilingual seals at the Clovis High School Graduation Ceremony on May 18!
<br><br>
Of those, 67 students received the NM Bilingualism-Biliteracy State Seal in Spanish, and 1 received the Clovis Municipal Schools District Bilingual Seal in Tagalog, a language of the Philippines.
<br><br>
These pictures are of few of those proud Clovis High School graduates.
<br><br>
Excellent job Graduates, the recognition for your hard work is well deserved!
<br><br>
Bilingual seal recipients were distinguished for their accomplishment with an additional black sash with turquoise embroidery marking them as seal recipients.
<br><br>
A bilingual seal indicates to others that a graduate has proven their proficiency in a language other than English, a valuable distinction as they go forward to secondary education and the work place.
<br><br>
The bilingual seal program builds upon the rich linguistic and cultural assets of the Clovis Municipal Schools District and communicates the mastery of two or more languages which is an important skill that is advantageous in our global society.

            <br>
Teacher assignments for the 2018-2019 school year will be made during the summer months. Teacher assignments will be posted in Skyward Family Access and a public announcement of their availability will be made in late summer.
<br><br>
In the past, next-year teacher assignments were listed on each student’s final report card, however due to the changes in staff allocation that take place between school years, teacher assignments can undergo several changes prior to the start of school.
<br><br>
The reliability of the information provided to families regarding teacher assignments improves by announcing those assignments closer to the start of the new school year.
<br><br>
Please contact the Clovis Municipal Schools Instruction Department for further information: (575) 769-4321

            <br>
Monday, 25 fifth graders from La Casita and Lockwood elementary schools were awarded a Gold Pathway to Biliteracy Seal and 11 were awarded a Silver Seal.<br><br>

Congratulations to all on their hard work and dedication to learning in not just one, but two languages!<br><br>

La Casita and Lockwood are the district's two dual language elementary campuses where students are taught in both English and Spanish with a goal of equal fluency.<br><br>

To receive a Silver Seal signifying achievement in Spanish, students must have at least 2 years in a Dual Language Program, pass the Avant STAMP Assessment with a 4 &gt;, successfully complete an Alternative Process Portfolio, a Oral/Written presentation in both languages.<br><br>

To receive a Gold Seal signifying achievement in Spanish and English, in addition to the requirements for a Silver Seal, students must demonstrate proficiency on the WIDA ACCESS or their Overall ELA tier on Istation must be Tier 1.<br><br>

Through an application process, students are able to determine if they qualify for the Pathway to Biliteracy-Bilingualism:Fifth Grade Achievement in Spanish or the Pathway to Biliteracy-Bilingualism: Fifth Grade Achievement in Spanish and English.
<br><br>
The ultimate goal is for students to continue towards the attainment of the NM Bilingualism-Biliteracy State Seal upon graduation from high school. The award builds upon the rich linguistic and cultural assets of the District and communicates the mastery of two or more languages which is an important skill that is advantageous in our global society.<br><br><div align="center">To view additional photos, please visit us on Facebook<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Clovis-Municipal-Schools-District-Offices-587103524649534/" target="_blank">| District Facebook |</a> </div>

            <br>
The Clovis Fire Department responded to a fire at Clovis Apartments, Monday, May 8, 2018 at approximately 4 p.m. Luckily none of the 46 residents was seriously hurt, although all find themselves in need of short-term shelter, and at least four families will be displaced for longer since their apartment units suffered significant damage.

<br><br>
For the first night the affected residents were helped by family and friends and the management company for Clovis Apartments. Today all are receiving help through the American Red Cross for their immediate needs (help with clothing, medication, and a couple nights lodging). For the next phase, the community has come together by creating the Clovis Apartment Fire Recovery Committee to address longer-term needs. The CAFRC will focus on assisting the displaced residents with the goal of getting all back to permanent housing and replacing household items.
<br><br>
The CAFRC will rely on the community’s generosity to accomplish this goal.
<br><br>
Financial donations to help these families should be made to United Way of Eastern New Mexico c/o Clovis Apt Fire Relief PO Box 806, Clovis NM 88102. Donations can also be made online at mkt.com/uwenm.
<br><br>
Clothing and furniture donations can be made to Matt 25 Hope Center (also Lighthouse Mission).
<br><br>
The CAFRC members include Erinn Burch-United Way of Eastern New Mexico, Sylvia Montano-Clovis Municipal Schools, Steve Reshetar-Matt 25 Hope Center, Destry Hernandez-Mental Health Resources, Sistar Yancy-Christian Believers, Sandra Darling Roberts and John Reuter-American Red Cross, Elaine Williford-ENM Baptist Disaster Response, and Dan Heerding-City of Clovis.
<br><br>
Clovis Mayor Lansford is spearheading the fundraising efforts for the families impacted by the fire. “I was saddened to hear of the 46 Clovis residents who have been recently displaced as a result of the fire at the Clovis Apartments on May 7th,” advised Lansford, Tuesday. “Losing your home is very unsettling and stressful. I encourage the community to rise to the occasion, to help families impacted by the fire at the Clovis Apartments get back to a stable environment. It’s a time like this when neighbors come together to help a neighbor in need and to be thankful for agencies like the UW of ENM that spearhead the rapid response of our community.”

            <br>

A 1987 Clovis High School graduate, while attending college, Armando pursued his first love; pharmacology.<br><br>

After working on several research teams, Armando worked as a Senior Clinical Research Pharmacologist at AbbVie Pharmaceutical. He was a consultant in Infectious Diseases (HCV and HIV) for 3 ½ years, dedicated to the Viekira compound.<br><br>

Armando and his team ensured that FDA guidelines were followed by doctors and lawyers when dealing with this investigational drug. The team took this drug to phases two and three for FDA approval. There was a 98% success rate in human trials. It is a pivotal cure, with much work involved.<br><br>

The FDA gave approval of Viekira Pak for patients around the world diagnosed with Genotype 1 Hepatitis C (HCV).<br><br>

Armando’s team later helped other pharmaceutical companies understand there was an unmet need for other HCV compounds for patients around the world infected by HCV.<br><br>

Armando is now working with Bayer Pharmaceutical as a Lead Pharmacologist in the Cardiovascular Division, specifically Diabetic Kidney Disease. There is a possibility to jump-start the Heart Failure program, now dependent on grant money.<br><br>

The Clovis Municipal Schools Education Foundation is proud to welcome Armando Jaurequi into the alumni Hall of Honor!
<br><br>
The purpose of the Hall of Honor awards is to recognize and honor former graduates of Clovis High School whose achievements, strengths of character, and citizenship serve as models to inspire and challenge today’s students. The Hall of Honor resides at Clovis High School.<br><br>

            <br>
Last week, parents, students and staff at Parkview Elementary came together to devise a plan for how they will work together to succeed.
<br><br>
Called a Title I Student/Parent/Teacher Compact, the plan is an agreement between parents and the school outlining how they will partner together to help the students at the school be successful. A living document that is reviewed and revised regularly, the compact is unique to each individual school community.
<br><br>
After years of using the same compact at all our Title I schools, it was time to lead our schools through a revision, so a process was modeled for sites to use that would enable them to come up with a joint compact between students, families, and staff.
<br><br>
Going forward, students, parents, and teachers will sign this document every fall. Mr. Marshall and his staff have done a great job of taking the modeled process to Parkview and engaging students and families in the revision process.
<br><br>
Congratulations Parkview for working together to achieve your goals!

            <br>
At its regular meeting on April 2, 1957, the Clovis School Board announced it had chosen to name the district’s new junior high school after then-La Casita Principal W.D. “Doc” Gattis.<br><br>

From the 1920’s through the late 1950’s – a period which notably spanned the Great Depression, World War II and Korean War eras – Gattis served as principal of La Casita Elementary at its original location of Seventh and Thornton streets.
<br><br>
A Tennessee native, Doc Gattis was known for his support of area youth sports. He coached local teams for decades and after retirement from education, served as justice of the peace, probate judge and served on the school board for several years, according to news accounts of his life.
<br><br>
Even though area surrounding the location for the school was virtually undeveloped grassland at the time the construction project meant changes, primarily for the dirt roads leading up to the site.
<br><br>
Prior to construction, in October 1956, the school board and City Planning Commission made a joint decision to close the segment of 14th Street that ran through the land section where the school would be built.
<br><br>
However where one road ends another begins, and in 1957, at the same meeting where the Gattis name was adopted, the board voted to open 13th Street to traffic. At that time a dirt road in front of the school’s entrance, 13th Street now runs between the front of the school and the La Casa Health Center complex, connecting Cameo and Beta streets.
<br><br>
Gattis, had not yet retired from the schools when his namesake junior high school was completed in 1957, and was able to see the junior high function for almost 20 years until his death in 1976.
<br><br>
W.D. Gattis Junior High carried his name for 50 years, until in 2007 the Clovis Municipal Schools Board of Education voted to rename the building the “Clovis High School Freshman Academy” in light of its transition from a middle school to a campus devoted exclusively to ninth grade students.
<br><br>
The Gattis name, however, remained important to the community, and in September 2011, the school board decided that a new middle school would once again bear the name of W.D. Gattis.
<br><br>
W.D. Gattis Middle School – situated in an area of undeveloped grassland on the outskirts of town much like its predecessor had 56 years before – opened its doors to students in August 2013.

            <br>
Nearly a year after ground was broken at the location for the new Parkview Elementary, construction continues to move at a steady pace, on track with a completion target of early June 2018.
<br><br>
Work within the building, under the direction of construction contractor Bradbury Stamm, is moving through various phases. With an average of 50-60 workers at the site daily, sometimes as many as 85, there is constant activity ranging from dirt work on the grounds to finishing work inside the structure.
<br><br>
The kinder wing, located on the west side of the building, for instance, is receiving drywall, paint, tile and final floor polishing, while on the east side, workers are hanging sheet rock and doing other types of finishing work.
<br><br>
At the end of this school year, the process of relocating the existing Parkview Elementary into its new home on east 14th Street will begin.
<br><br>
Over the summer, Highland Elementary will be relocated to the old Parkview Elementary building on Maple Street, and classes will be conducted there while its new building is constructed over the course of the 2018-2019 school year.

It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the untimely death of David Shawn Hunton, a Language Arts teacher at Clovis High School.
<br><br>
Our District has provided psychologists, counselors, and extra staff to assist students and teachers as we make our way through this difficult time. Students may exhibit all levels of emotions, ranging from crying, numbness, and feelings of despair, to just wanting to be close to family and friends. All responses are normal.
<br><br>
There is little we can say or do to remove the sting of pain we all feel. Our hearts and thoughts are with Mr. Hunton's family.

            <br>

In March of 1966, the Clovis School Board discussed an offer of land for the construction of a new elementary school. Under the initial arrangement offered, the school district would purchase two and a half acres of land from resident and widow Julia Barry Witherspoon, and in turn, she would gift an additional seven and a half to the district. 
 <br><br>
The district had been keeping an eye out for land for a new elementary since 1958, at which time the board discussed purchasing seven to eight acres at an anticipated $1,000-$2,000 each.
 <br><br>
Eventually the board did decide on Ms. Witherspoon’s land, however it was four years later in August of 1970, and the terms of the arrangement had changed. In the end, the school district purchased five acres for a total sum of $5,000 and were given two and a half additional acres as a gift – still a great savings considering they paid less than they had anticipated 12 years prior.
 <br><br>
A month after the purchase and gift were finalized, the board named the new school Barry Elementary. <br><br>

A construction bid of $483,887 was accepted that December, and eight months later, in August 1971, the contractor turned the newly completed building over to the school board. <br><br>

Located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thornton Street and Llano Estacado in north Clovis, at the time Barry Elementary opened its doors to students, it was the only structure in the area, surrounded by farmland and dirt roads. <br><br>

Today, 47 years later, Barry is adjacent to another school, the Los Ninos Early Intervention Center and is surrounded by residential neighborhoods and busy thoroughfares.  <br><br>

Serving kindergarten through fifth grade, Barry Elementary supports a student body of about 400 students residing between the northernmost edge of Curry County all the way south to Manana Boulevard

            <br>
Clovis Municipal Schools is deeply sorrowed by news of the Wednesday evening death of one of our middle school students. The student was a 12-year-old sixth grader at Marshall Middle School. 
<br><br>
To assist staff and students during this difficult time, grief counselors from Clovis and Portales are being made available at Marshall Middle School.
<br><br>
As this is a private family matter, which occurred after school hours, the district will not be releasing further information about the student or the circumstances surrounding the death. 
<br><br>
Our thoughts and prayers are with the student’s family and friends during this difficult time.

              <br>
Working furiously for the past week, students at the Arts Academy at Bella Vista signed their painting Friday morning, just minutes before it was photographed for submission.
<br><br>
Six students at the school – one from each grade – worked as a team to create the vibrant piece of art measuring 4-feet by 2-feet. The design features symbolism from around the state such as hot air balloons, a road runner, mountains a colorful sunset and much more.<br><br>

Serenity Vasquez, Jazlene Navarrete, Aariah Haughawaut, Melanie Lopez, Yoselin Maya Marrufo and Eziquiel Bamba worked under the guidance of teacher Janet Robertson, who felt very strongly the final design should come from them.
<br><br>
For several of the students, it was their first experience with painting, but they practiced and worked carefully. In the end, Robertson said they invested over 16 hours in the design.
<br><br>
Students from the Arts Academy at Bella Vista were selected by the New Mexico Public Education Department to decorate an egg representing the state of New Mexico for the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll.<br><br>

Printed on oversized, two-dimensional eggs with a placard crediting the school, student designs will be displayed to guests entering the Easter Egg Roll event at the White House on April 2, 2018.<br><br>

The White House Easter Egg Roll is a tradition begun by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878 and is said to be one of the oldest annual events in White House history. While Easter Eggs representing the states and territories of the nation have been
included at the White House event over the years, this is the first year school students have been asked to design state eggs.<br><br>

With more than 320 students in attendance and located on the west side of Clovis, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista is an elementary school with an emphasis on fine arts infused education. A high performing school, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista was one of five in the Clovis Municipal Schools District to be rated a 2017 New Mexico "A" School by the state.<br><br>

            <br>

In mid-February, information about the construction of Marshall Middle School was added to an online database created by The Living New Deal. <br><br>

Built 82 years ago in 1936, Marshall was constructed with grant funds provided by the Public Works Administration, operating under the New Deal. <br><br>

According to The Living New Deal, it cost $123,102 to build Marshall, $55,271 of which was paid for with grant funds. <br><br>

Construction was started and completed within one year. <br><br>

Responding to the Great Depression, the New Deal was a program created by Franklin D. Roosevelt in an effort to stimulate the economy and put people to work to combat joblessness. <br><br>

A non-profit organization hosted by the geography department of the University of California, Berkley, the Living New Deal's goal is to document the New Deal legacy, "Because New Deal public works were rarely marked, the era’s contribution to American life goes largely unseen and unappreciated. <br><br>

It seems inconceivable that no national register exists of what the New Deal built; yet there is none. Now the Living New Deal is rectifying that oversight – for historians but especially for the American people."<br><br><div align="center">

            <br>
Students from the Arts Academy at Bella Vista have been selected to decorate an egg representing the state of New Mexico for the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll.<br><br>

The Arts Academy at Bella Vista was selected by a committee from the New Mexico Public Education Department, chosen from a pool of 89 school districts and charters in the state.<br><br>

As soon as news of the honor was received, students and staff began working immediately to produce a design that will showcase the unique character and personality of the state of New Mexico. "My teachers and students are excited and we already have a dynamic team working on the egg design," said school Principal Shelly Norris.<br><br>

Printed on oversized, two-dimensional eggs with a placard crediting the school, student designs will be displayed to guests entering the Easter Egg Roll event at the White House on April 2, 2018.<br><br>

The White House Easter Egg Roll is a tradition begun by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878 and is said to be one of the oldest annual events in White House history.<br><br>

While Easter Eggs representing the states and territories of the nation have been included at the White House event over the years, this is the first year school students have been asked to design state eggs.<br><br>

“President Donald J. Trump and the First Lady are honored to continue the traditions of the past while weaving new traditions into the fabric of our Nation,” the invitation stated.<br><br>

With more than 320 students in attendance and located on the west side of Clovis, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista is an elementary school with an emphasis on fine arts infused education. A high performing school, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista was one of five in the Clovis Municipal School District to be rated a 2017 New Mexico "A" School by the state.<br><br><div align="center">

Don't be surprised if you see students lobbing white cubes at their classmates next time you walk through a school in the district.<br><br>

After attending a January Professional Development program on classroom management and student engagement, teachers expressed an interest in having some of the materials that were presented by Kagan Publishing &amp; Professional Development.<br><br>

The district was able to use a credit with the company to purchase about $1,300 in classroom materials designed to get students up and moving while learning and reinforcing lesson concepts.<br><br>

Marked with question prompts on the front and back, "Learning Chips" are used to get kids talking about concepts and to review things that have been covered in class.<br><br>

Similar but a whole lot more active, color-coded foam cubes called "Lesson Launchers" can be tossed around the room as a fun way to reinforce lessons.<br><br>

During the training, about 100 teachers from K-12th grade classrooms around the district learned how to apply the Kagan concepts with their students.<br><br>

Teachers left the training excited to put those lesson tools to work in their classrooms and the district is happy to be able to provide them supplemental materials to help them do just that!<br><br>

            <br>
Thursday, the halls of Sandia Elementary were filled with doctors, police officers, farmers, football players and even a scuba diver. Among the array of professionals, a principal and coach wouldn't have seemed out of place, were it not for the fact they haven't finished elementary school yet.<br><br>

Sandia students were told to come to school dressed as the person they want to be when they grow up, in keeping with the theme of the Dr. Seuss book "Oh the places you'll go".
<br><br>
Kindergarten student Leonardo Dominguez came to school dressed as Sandia Principal Dr. Vetterly, and even got to act the part by giving the morning announcements with Dr. Vetterly.<br><br>
Coach Michael was also surprised by Emylee Vetterly, who came to school as her doppelganger for the event.<br><br>

Officially celebrated on March 2, Read Across America Day is a special day to celebrate reading and coincides with the birthday of Dr. Seuss.
<br><br>
Schools throughout the Clovis Municipal Schools district are celebrating with Dr. Seuss activities all this week. <br><br>

Clovis Municipal Schools does not endorse or support solicitations by non-school third parties.<br><br>

Do not give money to anyone for school use unless you are confident that (s)he is either an employee or student of the District and is authorized to solicit funds.<br><br>

Local businesses are usually the first to be targeted for solicitation from third-party agencies or organizations stating they are raising funds on behalf of the students and/or staff of Clovis Municipal Schools.<br><br>

If you are a business owner and encounter solicitations of this type, the agency or organization is not raising funds on our behalf.<br><br>

When funding solicitation is necessary for district clubs, organizations, athletic programs, advertising events, or individual schools, the requests will come directly from an employee or student of the district.<br><br>

If you believe someone is inappropriately soliciting money on behalf of Clovis Municipal Schools, please contact the Superintendent's Office at 575-769-4320.<br><br><div align="center">

In collaboration with the University of Virginia, Partnership for Leaders in
Education (UVA-PLE), Clovis Municipal Schools has chosen Marshall, Yucca, and WD
Gattis Middle Schools, as focus sites.<br><br>

The collaborative project has been named, "Clovis Middle School Initiative (#CMSI)."<br><br>
Throughout the next two years, Clovis Municipal Schools’ Executive Director of
Instruction Mitzi Estes, will serve as the program Shepherd and will work closely
with the schools. The focus will be leadership development, data driven instruction,
and 90-Day Plans with the goal of increased student achievement.
<br><br>
According to UVA'S website, "Partnership for Leaders in Education (PLE) is a joint
venture of the University of Virginia Darden School of Business and the Curry School
of Education.
<br><br>
Established in 2003, the PLE was formed in order to combine the most innovative
thinking in business and education to better serve our nation's children by
empowering education leaders to meet the demands of operating schools and
school systems. Believing in the critical importance of effective school system
leadership, the PLE designs and delivers programs, including the University of
Virginia School Turnaround Program, to strengthen leadership practice and
establish proof points of excellence."
<br><br>
Clovis Municipal Schools is excited for the opportunity to begin a partnership with
the University of Virginia and is committed to pursuing the changes our students
deserve.

In the days before the end of holiday break, teachers with Clovis Municipal Schools attended training sessions for professional development. In her weekly column, Cindy Kleyn-Kennedy writes about one of these training sessions, "Capturing kid's hearts", which marks the start of a new program being implemented at the middle school level.
<br><br>
The program’s proven track record has been shown to improve student performance and attendance; reduce discipline referrals; increase graduation rates; and improve teacher retention.

            <br>
U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. recently nominated three CHS seniors to attend service academies beginning in 2018. The students were among a group of 50 New Mexico high school seniors nominated this year.
<br><br>
The Clovis High School students are:<br><ul>Cameron Kuykendall - West Point <br>
Corde Mailman - U.S. Air Force Academy <br>
Megan Edwards - U.S. Merchant Marine Academy </ul>
<br>
Clovis Municipal Schools is proud to congratulate all three on their prestigious accomplishment!
<br><br>
Udall said in a statement, "I am excited to congratulate the 50 New Mexico students I have nominated to the United States service academies this year. These students represent New Mexico's best and brightest, and I wish them luck as they continue with the admissions process. 
<br><br>
These exceptional students have demonstrated strong leadership in both their academic and extracurricular endeavors, as well as a commitment to serve — a true testament to their character and motivation. I have no doubt these students will represent New Mexico well as they continue their education and pursue a life of leadership and service.
<br><br>
A congressional, vice-presidential, or service-connected nomination is required for admission to the U.S. Military Academy (West Point), the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Students who received my nomination completed a competitive application process, which included an interview with the military and community leaders who comprise my Military Academy Service Panels. The nominees will compete for admission to their service academy over the coming months, and those admitted will begin classes in the summer of 2018 as members of the class of 2022."

Before the holiday break, Cindy Kleyn-Kennedy stumbled onto an unadvertised act of kindness by district cafeteria workers.
<br><br>
Not only do they put care and pride into feeding students at 17 schools every day, Kleyn-Kennedy learned they also have a 20-or-so year tradition of baking 1,000 Christmas cookies for a local mission to distribute during holiday meals and events.

Students welcomed her and showed her the ropes, "...Another confident young 5th grader sitting at a desk adjacent to mine, Angel Concha, leaned over and explained that I just needed to follow him," she recalls.

For Kleyn-Kennedy, the experience turned out to be much more than a power-walk.

Exploring the music programs at Clovis Municipal Schools in her most recent article, Cindy Kleyn-Kennedy talks with program director Brandon Boerio about the district's music successes this year and outlook on the future.<br><br>

Boerio's philosophy is simple, “What I’ve discovered in education is that all kids need attention, and that need manifests itself in different ways, from problem behaviors to the other end of the spectrum. All students, however, are drawn to feeling successful. When they feel successful, that’s when they have real buy-in, and this applies to all kids everywhere, regardless of demographics. They know when they’re successful.”

1961 Clovis High School graduate Dr. Alvy Ray (Jerry) Smith is the co-founder of Pixar Films and winner of two Academy Awards.<br><br>

Considered one of the creators of the Alpha Chanel, a pixel rendering technique that revolutionized modern animation, Smith recently spoke at New Mexico State University.
<br><br>
Read his inspiring words on how it's within reach to find fame and success even for those growing up in a small town, something he never could have imagined as a Clovis youth in the 1960's.
<br><br>
Earning a place in the Clovis Municipal Schools Education Foundation's inaugural 2010 Hall of Honor, Smith's successes have long been a source of pride for the community.

Thank you Dr. Smith!<br><br>

An update of the Skyward Family Access App is available for Android users.<br><br>

After updating to the newest version of the Skyward Mobile Access app from the Google Play Store, you will be asked to re-enter your Skyward account password when signing into the app with your passcode.<br><br>

Enter your password and save by pressing the icon in the top-right corner of the screen. You will then need to enter and confirm your pin code for the app.
<br><br>
This requirement is due to improvements made for storing account passwords within the app.<br><br>

DISTRICT USERS: If you are using a district internet connection, it is necessary to turn off the Wifi on your device and complete the update and password re-entry using the data provided by your service provider.
<br><br>

For the first two weekends in December, 90 of our kindergarten-12th grade teachers attended training courses.<br><br>

Called "ELevate Your EL Instruction" (with EL being an abbreviation for English Learner), the course not only addresses meeting the needs of those students experiencing English for the first time, it also teaches teachers about the language acquisition process that all students experience.
<br><br>
Approximately 10 percent of the student population in Clovis Municipal Schools are classified English Learners , with such languages represented as Chinese, Japanese, Native languages, Spanish, Tagalog and Vietnamese.
<br><br>
However every student, whether English is their first language or not, spends their education years acquiring language at different levels.
<br><br>
Exploring the importance of language and culture and learning the process of how students acquire language is critical for teachers, and this knowledge enriches the effectiveness of instruction for all students.
<br><br>
Hats off to our CMS teachers and thank you for the extra time you invest in our students!<br><br>

True for any age/grade level, follow this process when using flashcards to study:<br><br>
1. Only give your student fifteen study cards/flashcards at a time.
<br><br>
2. Eight cards should consist of new information and seven cards should consist of previous terms or math facts students have learned.
<br><br>
3. As students read through the cards, if they do not answer it correctly the student immediately says the term and the answer 3 times in a row while looking at the card.
<br><br>
4. Then place that card two cards back (not to the back of the stack) so they will see it again quickly. If students answer the card correctly, they can remove the card from the stack.
<br><br>
5. Continue until all cards are removed and have students try them again at a later time.

Due to community need and in preparation for the upcoming flu season, the New Mexico Department of Health’s Clovis Public Health Office will be hosting another free flu vaccine clinic for children. The clinic will take place on Saturday to allow opportunity to those unable to participate in previous clinics.<br><ul>WHO: School children ages 4-18<br>

Flu vaccines will be administered free of charge, but we ask that you please bring insurance and/or Medicaid information in order for the Health Office to complete it's paperwork.

The severity of the influenza virus can vary from year to year, but seasonal flu vaccines protect against the influenza viruses expected to be most common during the upcoming season. Nothing can protect you from the flu better than getting vaccinated every year.
<br><br>
Just a reminder, Clovis Municipal Schools will NOT be administering flu vaccines to students at school this year.

The severity of the influenza virus can vary from year to year, but seasonal flu vaccines protect against the influenza viruses expected to be most common during the upcoming season. Nothing can protect you from the flu better than getting vaccinated every year.
<br><br>
Just a reminder, Clovis Municipal Schools will NOT be administering flu vaccines to students at school this year.
