<p><strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The statewide decision was made to have students continue to learn from home and not return to our school buildings for the remainder of the school year</span></strong>. We will keep on working remotely and both schools and supervisors will remain in contact with parents and employees in the coming days. Our meal program will continue through the end of the school year, May 26. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4-22-20</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Graduation: </p>
<p>KCS high schools all have backup graduation dates between June 24-27. These dates and plans are all tentative and will be used only if social gatherings are permitted by the state, local officials and medical community. There are additional backup plans being made in the case that we should not gather at that time.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4-21-20</span></strong></p>
<p>If you missed the opportunity to pick up a 5-day boxed meal kit this week, there will be a Ryder refrigerated truck delivering to several locations tomorrow. In order to receive a box, you must pick it up at the given location and provide your child or children’s lunch/student ID number. Parents from any part of the county can travel to these locations. <br><br>The refrigerated truck locations and times for tomorrow, April 22, are as follows:<br><br>East Bank Middle at 10 a.m.<br>Belle Elementary at 10:45 a.m.<br>Malden Elementary at 11:30 a.m.<br>Piedmont Elementary at 12:15 p.m.<br><br>This will be first come, first serve and the truck will stop running once meals have been distributed. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4-18-20</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>April 13th Feeding Program</strong></p>
<p>For this week’s feeding program, we will continue with all areas, except for Sissonville, being delivered on Monday, April 13th. All Monday buses will leave at 11 am instead of 10:30, 30 minutes later than normal, due to predicted weather. Please add 30 minutes onto the time that you have been meeting the bus. <br><br>Sissonville meals will be delivered on Tuesday, April 14th and buses will leave at the normal 10:30 time.<br><br>There will be no milk delivered due to the inability to adequately refrigerate the amount of milk needed.<br><br>Families will still need to provide a lunch number/student ID for each meal box.</p>
<p>If you are a walker and do not have a bus stop or if you're trying to find out what time the bus will be there, you can talk to a neighbor, click “<a href="http://edulog.kana.k12.wv.us/liveweb/webquery/">School and Bus Information</a>” and input your address or call your bus garage or the main transportation number to find the stop closest to you or where your children are staying. <a href="../../../Article/3779/bus-terminal-contact-information">Bus terminal information click here</a>.

<p><strong>*Update for Capital-Area Families*</strong></p>
<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="8nfiv" data-offset-key="crfk4-0-0">
<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="crfk4-0-0"><span data-offset-key="crfk4-0-0"><span data-text="true">Due to the late arrival of one of the food trucks today, we will only service the King Center, City Park and South Park with boxed meals today. The rest of the Capital area will be serviced with Sissonville tomorrow. Everything will be the same, the delivery will just be tomorrow instead of today if you are outside of King Center, City Park or South Park. </span></span></div>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4-4-20</span></strong></p>
<p>As a follow up to our last message on Monday’s 5-day feeding program, we wanted to give you two updates.</p>
<p>First: the Sissonville area will receive their boxes on Tuesday. Buses will run their normal routes on what should be very close to the same schedule as last week. If you are outside of the Sissonville area, your boxed meals will still be delivered as usual along bus routes on Monday.</p>
<p>Second: milk will be provided outside of the prepared meal boxes. You may want to also bring a bag or other item to carry your milk.</p>
<p>All information, including what to do to find your closest bus stop and time, is available directly below in the 4-1-20 Update. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4-1-20</span></strong></p>
<p>For the 5-day meal delivery on Monday, April 6th, the county is switching to boxed meals through Compass Food Service. This will eliminate the preparation of meals by KCS staff and volunteers. These boxes will still include one breakfast and lunch per day and nothing will change for their delivery unless you are in the Sissonville area. If you are in the Sissonville area, your delivery may be on a different day than Monday. You will receive a separate message later this week with additional details on when your delivery will be made. If you are a parent outside of the Sissonville area, you will still show up at your bus stop on Monday for meal delivery as you have been. Buses will leave at the same time as they did this week. This plan is based on driver availability and is subject to change. We will let you know if there are changes.<br><br>The same reminders are being given as this week:</p>
<p>· If you are a walker or do not have a bus stop, you can talk to a neighbor, click “<a href="http://edulog.kana.k12.wv.us/liveweb/webquery/">School and Bus Information</a>” and input your address or call your bus garage or the main transportation number to find the stop closest to you or where your children are staying. <a href="../../../Article/3779/bus-terminal-contact-information">Bus terminal information click here</a>. Or, main transportation number: 348-6616. </p>
<p>· On Monday, parents or students are asked to give a lunch number for each student receiving a meal. This is so we can make sure that as many students are served as possible.</p>
<p>· Please note that because we’re delivering more food, it’s taking longer at stops. </p>
<p>· Also, because there will be five days worth of food, you may want to consider bringing a box, wagon, or extra set of arms when picking up the bagged meals.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3-26-20 Update</strong></span></p>
<p>The statewide school closure due to COVID-19 has been extended until April 30th. That means that we will continue to implement our current online learning plan through at least April 30. Your school will be communicating next steps so please be sure to check in through whatever communication channels you’ve been using with your school.</p>
<p>We also have an update for Monday’s 5-day bagged meal service. Thank you for having patience as we work on our feeding program and do the very best we can.</p>

<p>· On Monday, parents or students are asked to give a lunch number for each student receiving a meal.</p>
<p>· Please note that because we’re delivering more food, it’s taking longer at stops. Your bus may be running 15-30 minutes longer than it has been on Monday.</p>
<p>· Also, because there will be five days worth of food, you may want to consider bringing a box, wagon, or extra set of arms when picking up the bagged meals.</p>
<p>Regrettably, KCS will be canceling all eight high school proms due to the COVID-19 outbreak in our community. Our proms had been scheduled to begin on April 18th. We are sorry to have to make this announcement. Thank you for your continued support and patience. </p>
<p><strong>3-23-20 Update</strong></p>
<p>Kanawha County Schools will restart its feeding program and move to a model of one delivery day per week with multiple days worth of bagged meals being delivered. This week’s delivery day will be Wednesday, March 25, and we will distribute three days worth of meals (Wednesday-Friday) on Wednesday. All meals will be delivered on Wednesday at bus stops as we did last week. Beginning next week, bagged meals will be delivered every Monday with a five day supply being provided at bus stops. We will continue to provide details leading up to delivery days and we thank you for your patience as we work to see that our students are fed.</p>
<p><strong>3-22-20 Update</strong></p>
<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="56gcs" data-offset-key="47b14-0-0">
<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="47b14-0-0">During the first full week of our school outage due to COVID-19, Kanawha County Schools was proud to mobilize and be able to prepare and deliver thousands of bagged meals to our students. <strong>Due to current conditions and limitations brought by the spread of COVID-19, we are discontinuing bagged meal service. We value the health and safety of our employees and also of the volunteers who’ve been supporting us. We will investigate other ways to feed our students and will share additional plans as they are developed.</strong> For the time being, the feeding program will be halted and our support services as a district will continue through our counselors, social workers and other staff. If you have a need that is not being met during this time of school closure, please call your school, the district office or call 2-1-1 on your phone to reach The United Way help line. Thank you.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>3-20-20 Update</strong></p>
<p>Our schools have now distributed plans and materials for our students to complete curriculum from home. We want to make sure to remind you that you are not alone and your teachers and schools are available to help. If you have a question and cannot get through to a teacher, please call the school. Your school will be able to support you. </p>
<p>If you do not have online access at home, please call your school or reach out to our technology team at <a href="tel:304-348-6116">304-348-6116</a> or email <a href="mailto:schoology@mail.kana.k12.wv.us">schoology@mail.kana.k12.wv.us</a>. </p>
<p>Also, the KCS out-of-area transfer request process that was scheduled to begin at 6 a.m. on April 1st has been cancelled. We will send out additional information once there is a new process in place. This only applies to those parents who are requesting out-of-area transfers. </p>
<p><strong>3-15-20 COVID-19 Plan Update</strong></p>
<p>Per an announcement by Governor Justice yesterday, all schools and programs, will remain closed until at least Friday, March 27. That will be the point when we re-evaluate and share additional information.</p>
<p>All extracurricular activities are canceled. This includes practices. </p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
<p>All teachers will post work for their students through Schoology, Remind, Class Dojo, or whatever communication method they use to contact parents. This is mandatory. Work and resources will be available to students no later than Thursday, March 19. </p>
<p>Elementary principals will be at their schools on Monday from 8am-12pm for parents to pick up 4th and 5th grade iPads only. </p>
<p>If your middle and high school student is currently without an iPad and they do not have another technology item to work from, please call the technology department at <a href="tel:304-348-6116">304-348-6116</a> and make arrangements to pick up the device.  Due to the time it takes to set one up, we ask that you do not show up without calling first.  We will get it set up ahead of time so that you can just stop in and pick it up.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to Schoology, please call the technology department at <a href="tel:304-348-6116">304-348-6116</a> or email <a href="mailto:schoology@mail.kana.k12.wv.us">schoology@mail.kana.k12.wv.us</a></p>
<p><strong>Food: </strong></p>
<p>We have updated our feeding program. Some bagged meals will be available at every KCS school. In addition, bagged meals will be delivered at our normal bus stops along each school bus run. Buses will leave each feeder high school at 10:30 a.m. and start their normal run. All you need to do is wait at your child’s bus stop for a meal to be delivered. To get an approximate time for drop off on Monday, you can call your bus garage or the main transportation office for bus times, or it will be 4 hours later than the elementary bus stop times. </p>

<p><strong>KCS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Plan for Schools</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brenda Isaac RN, Lead School Nurse</strong></p>
<p><strong>304-348-6694, Ext. 341</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a fluid plan and may be updated based on the latest information from health officials<strong> </strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Kanawha County Schools Health Services is in frequent contact with the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department. KCHD is working collaboratively with WV Bureau for Public Health’s Office of Epidemiology and Prevention Services and the Division of Infectious Disease Epidemiology.  Their information is updated daily from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</li>
<li>There are several different types of coronaviruses, some of which have been around for years. These are referred to as the Common Coronaviruses and usually cause symptoms similar to the common cold.  Many of us have had common coronaviruses in the past and assumed we had the common cold, treated it as such, and recovered in a week or two.</li>
<li>The Coronavirus that started in China in December is referred to as the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).</li>
</ol>
<p>Working closely with KCHD, this is currently our plan for dealing with COVID-19 should it reach the West Virginia area. </p>
<ol>
<li>We will use the same precautions that we have used for the regular flu and other virus protection. Regular cleaning and disinfecting of desks, computer keyboards, door knobs, water fountains and other frequently touched surfaces within the schools.</li>
<li>Thorough handwashing for at least 20 seconds before meals, after using the restrooms and whenever hands are visibly dirty.</li>
<li>Educating students (and staff) to avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Cough Etiquette. Always cover cough or sneeze, with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and thoroughly wash your hands immediately. If tissues aren’t available, cough into the inside of the elbow.</li>
<li>Hand sanitizer, with 60%-90% alcohol, may be used only when soap and water is not available.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick with flu-like symptoms. Those who display these symptoms should go home and remain home until all symptoms are gone for at least 24 hours.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If a student or school employee is diagnosed with COVID-19, they must stay home for the recommended 14-day period that they are considered to be contagious.</span> The suspected case should be immediately reported to the school nurse or the KCS Office of Health Services. The diagnosis will be confirmed with KCHD. COVID-19 is an immediately reportable disease.</li>
<li>If there is a positive diagnosis, parents will need to call the school. Parents will also have to provide documentation when the student is cleared to return.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">School administrators will work with local health officials to make dismissal and cancellation decisions. These dismissals will be made on a case-by-case basic based on the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and the specific cases in the impacted community.</span> In the case of a school dismissal, all extra-curricular activities for that school will be cancelled if a school is closed. If a virtual student's school is dismissed, then they will not be permitted to attend the lab during this time frame.</li>
<li>Teachers will post work for students on Schoology for all grades. Students can use their iPads to access Schoology and their work to be completed. Fourth and fifth graders will be permitted to take their iPads home. In addition, students in K-3 can get their work through the normal methods their individual teachers use to communicate if the teacher is not using Schoology.</li>
