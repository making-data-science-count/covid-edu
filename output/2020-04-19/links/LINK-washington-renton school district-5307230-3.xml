			<p>Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced on April 6, 2020 that schools across the state will be closed for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year in order to slow the spread of COVID-19, the coronavirus. During this closure, all schools in our district will remain closed. </p>

<p>We acknowledge continued school closures present many challenges for students, staff, families, and the entire community. This is difficult news for all of us: students miss their friends and teachers, and we miss our students. While staff across our district are demonstrating their professional and personal commitment to our students in meaningful and inspiring ways, we understand that this extended closure also raises numerous questions for students and families. We have been working for the past several weeks to provide education in a different, sustainable model; and we will continue to work to provide answers to questions brought by this new directive.</p>

<p>See tabs below for information on services for students/families during the closure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meal Service</li>
	<li>Student Learning During Closure</li>
	<li>State Testing</li>
	<li>Childcare</li>

<section data-use-new="true" id="fsEl_32499"><p>Washington Governor Jay Inslee has directed school districts to work to provide free childcare services for children kindergarten-5<sup>th</sup> grade whose caretakers are first responders and essential health care workers. We recently surveyed our families to determine those who fall into these important life-supporting categories and are in need of this childcare assistance.</p>

<p>Following the governor’s directions, have created a service for these professionals. If you fall into the category of first responders or essential health care worker and did not have a chance to respond to the survey, please contact <a href="mailto:community.relations@rentonschools.us">community.relations@rentonschools.us</a>. Space is limited; and we can only provide this service to those in the life-care categories.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Who is a first responder?</strong> A person who works for police, fire, paramedics, etc.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Who is an essential health care worker?</strong> A person who works for a medical facility, including at nursing homes, doctor’s offices, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, adult family homes, etc.</li>

			<p>Dear Families of Students With Disabilities,</p>

<p>As Renton School District works to support our families and community during this exceptionally challenging time, we want to assure you that the needs of exceptional learners are being taken into consideration. The Federal Government and the State of Washington are currently developing guidance for the provision of special education services during school closures and changes to education models as a result of COVID-19. We are monitoring the development of guidance carefully and we are committed to partnering with you through frequent communication.</p>

<p>Currently, please note the following information was shared by Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI):</p>

<p><i>“Districts should also consider ways to use distance technology (e.g., Zoom, conference calls) to the extent possible to provide child find, hold initial and annual IEP meetings, and/or evaluation/eligibility meetings, if staff and parents are available but not able to attend in person. Continuing to complete IEP and evaluation/eligibility meetings will help decrease the workload when school resumes. If staff and/or parents are not available or believe their participation is impacted by the lack of an in-person meeting, districts should document the reason and complete the activity in a timely manner following the ending of school closures.”</i></p>

<p>Accordingly, our IEP and evaluation teams are in the process of setting up virtual meetings with families.  You may be contacted by staff to schedule a special education team meeting via phone or video conference. </p>

<p>Your student’s individual needs are very important to the Renton School District team. We are not providing services to students during this closure. We plan to meet with IEP teams, including families, when school resumes to address student specific needs resulting from the closure. If you have questions or concerns about your student’s services at this time, please do not hesitate to contact our Special Education Department at 425-204-2280.</p>

<p><b>Question: Will my student still receive special education services during the closure including OT, PT, and SLP services? </b></p>

<p>Answer:  As long as schools are closed, we are not providing instruction for students, which means special education services will also be on hold. Please reach out to your child’s case manager or related service provider, by email, if you have questions around how you can provide support for your student at home during the closure.</p>

<p><b>Question: Will my student’s IEP or evaluation meeting still be held during the closure?</b></p>

<p>Answer: Special education staff may still hold IEP/Evaluation meetings during the closure. These meetings will however be held either over the phone or virtually. If you prefer to wait until after the closure and have a face-to-face meeting that is okay as well. Per OSPI we will be documenting any IEP/Evaluation meetings that are late due to COVID-19.</p>

<p><b>Question: If my IEP/Evaluation meeting is missed due to the closure how soon will it be made up? </b></p>

<p>Answer: Our staff will work as quickly as possible to schedule missed IEP/Evaluation meetings once school resumes with the goal of completing them within two weeks after school is back in session.</p>

			<p>Renton School District Families:</p>

<p>Teachers and school support staff, along with students and families, are showing incredible creativity, resilience, and compassion as we shift education from the classroom to a remote model. Staying at home can feel isolating, but our staff are experimenting with fun and innovative approaches to ensure our students are feeling connected. </p>

<p>Last Friday, we sent you a video regarding the closure of schools from Renton Schools Superintendent Damien Pattenaude. If you have not had the chance to watch it, <a href="https://youtu.be/wPkPqrWtB_I">you can see it here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some updates on our work to support students and families: </p>

<p>For our elementary and middle school students, teachers will continue posting learning activities aligned to grade level standards/courses. These can be found on each school’s websites under “In-Home Learning”. For our high school students, Monday was the start of the 3rd trimester.  High school teachers are engaging students in coursework, providing assignments that may be accessed through email, Canvas, or Google Classroom. Students and families should access Skyward to see their 3rd Trimester schedules and teacher list. If you have questions, please contact your child’s school.   </p>

<p><strong>Technology Support for Students</strong><br>
Nearly 10,000 students have district-provided Chromebooks at home to support learning during the closure. Elementary schools continue to provide Chromebooks to families this week and next (arranged and communicated by each school). We have posted resources for <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/departments/technology-services/technology-for-student-learning">basic support with student technology</a>. All access and activity on school district-provided devices is filtered and monitored. Information regarding <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/departments/technology-services/technology-safety-information-for-families">filtering as well as student data privacy and security</a> is posted. We’ve also shared resources for families to support <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/learning-and-teaching/digital-learning/digital-citizenship-resources-for-families">digital citizenship</a> and responsible use of technology at home.</p>

<p>Clarifying directions for Zoom meetings: We have pushed out the Zoom app to all district-issued student Chromebooks. Students do not need a Zoom account to join a meeting and should not start their own Zoom meetings. Directions for students: <a href="https://bit.ly/RSD-zoom-student">bit.ly/RSD-zoom-student</a> <em>Regarding Zoom security</em>: We have adjusted several district-wide security settings to become standards in Zoom (e.g. requiring a “waiting room,” meeting passwords, and host-only screen-sharing).</p>

<p><strong>Family Refunds</strong><br>
In an effort to provide families with financial relief, our Business Services Office has created an online refund process for families and students who prepaid for spring field trips, spring athletic fees, ASB cards, third trimester parking, and more. Here’s a link to the<a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/departments/business-services"> online refund request process</a> for families and students who wish to request refunds. </p>

<p><strong>Waiving Credits for Seniors</strong><br>
The State Board of Education (SBE) has provided a waiver program as a temporary solution for immediate challenges faced by high school seniors in light of school building closures due to COVID-19.<a href="https://sbe.wa.gov/news/flexibility-graduating-seniors-approved-state-board"> Superintendent Pattenaude has applied for the waiver. The SBE will likely decide on the waiver by next week. Click here to read the SBE’s FAQs regarding the waiver</a>. Additionally, the Renton School District Board of Directors will have the opportunity to consider if there is a need to waive any local graduation requirements for the Class of 2020. </p>

<p><strong>High School Graduation</strong><br>
Next week, Superintendent Pattenaude will meet with representatives of each high school’s senior class as well as their principals to discuss graduation commencement and other topics. We will keep you updated on any plans for graduation.</p>

<p><strong>Higher Education</strong><br>
The Washington State Council of Presidents, Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges, and Independent Colleges of Washington released a joint statement for students, families, and school districts regarding their plan to address the impacts of COVID-19 on incoming and future students. <a href="https://councilofpresidents.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Joint-Academic-Statement.pdf">Read the statement here</a>. Additionally, the<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/university-of-washington-wont-require-freshman-applicants-to-take-the-sat-or-act/"> University of Washington has announced</a> that high school students in the Class of 2021 do not need to take the SAT or ACT for admission. </p>

<p><strong>Special Education</strong><br>
Special education teachers and therapists are contacting families to develop a continuous learning plan for students with an Individual Education Plan (IEP).</p>

<p><strong>Meals for Students</strong><br>
School meals continue to be served and are available for students Monday-Friday, 11 a.m. to noon at the <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/students-families#fs-panel-32497">following locations</a>. Children no longer need to be present for family members to pick-up meals. When picking up meals, please remember to practice good social distancing and stand at least six feet away from others.</p>

<p><strong>Child Care</strong><br>
We continue to provide free child care services for children kindergarten through 5th grade whose caretakers are first responders and essential health care workers. Additionally, we’ve placed some resources for families in need of child care on our<a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/students-families"> Student and Families Support webpage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2020 Census</strong><br>
The very important 2020 Census is underway. Responses by our Newcastle and Renton families and neighbors continue to increase:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Nearly 63% of Newcastle residents responded;</li>
	<li>Nearly 56% of Renton residents responded; and</li>
	<li>Nearly 54% of King County residents responded.</li>
</ul>
<p>In comparison, in 2010, the last time the Census took place:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>only 74% of Newcastle residents responded (meaning more than 25% did not);</li>
	<li>just under 68% of Renton residents responded (nearly a third of residents did not); and</li>
	<li>only 73% of King County residents responded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Washington state will lose about $5.8 million over ten years for every 100 households missed in the count. Let's work to improve those numbers this year and commit to filling out the important 2020 Census which provides funding for hospitals, roads, school lunches, firefighters, families in need, and more. Grab you mailer and fill out <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmy2020census.gov%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1uOea8mppl4JUWqCt4bxf6YeBCXoGht1CqbFGNNVID6vxVLnqhdrkCgT4&amp;h=AT1oDJY3rWOY6tp0Y7DTlQwuIeqMW6QlpTNgk0DHP_IXY4ASOH-y31JD6iK3RYdh5hftvdWZssnsf197zIsYoFERx3TyR4RtIBPuC0vgljzYaelF51Rx-CwGwpoDz6qGILOHWugIGamA1izNTKcaLArwjG-6uo09vbFE3IPz2TQSUubFVsNBQQyHhXau7QKhCo8v2G1EdmQdD2_8-8Fl1I9eOTYr3dbXygsRXlpqT36v7WRL1lH967F9n7EQ5REu2stSEHKURts4EjNiWZlWnB-ZTaJqjMy6oVy3iyDtgs6Vy9jOUnOXV9juBz-Y5JN_fui73NL_L-TL-nQNUZDrBCUngXAOFaSFXJQ5rz04jcY-d1SkrIwCJWv_hoJt6hOEgTwKb4z7yfSUvnDTMo_lUkL3Hxh2ZhO0VJumpq_U_jNfinfQibJghoX0assH_nohSS6ii351Od7WAifUi376mvpmmTkd1Z4nGf4YRoOirYF5ec6Vy3GfED52vQ0_h7C4LS6SmhDhfEpoUusxkgMkAsZxnPnQa-RlS89jH32ZlmpiubVAYdV622kTdq-ZiqL86tEwirMwTJgY0cukC0ADb0ZCZBXbGrytpvqdDt4">my2020census.gov</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Stay Healthy and Safe</strong><br>
As we continue to navigate through this difficult time, we must remember that we all share responsibility in bringing our community and nation back to health. Even while staying at home, it is important to practice excellent hygiene and sanitation. Staying home and limiting person-to-person contact appears to be making a difference in slowing the spread of COVID-19, but those measures must continue in order to be effective long-term. As much as possible, stay home, limit trips outside, and stay six feet apart from people outside of your home. Please keep you and your family healthy and safe.</p>

			<p>Renton School District Families,</p>

<p dir="ltr">Teachers and district support staff have been working hard this week as we continue to provide students with in-home learning resources and essential services during the closure. This update will provide you with information about our work.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>In-Home Learning</strong><br>
Principals are communicating directly with families about the next steps for In-Home Learning. Families have either seen those email earlier this week or can expect it soon. For high school students, Trimester 3 will begin on Monday, April 13.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Elementary Chromebook Distribution</strong><br>
Elementary school families were recently sent information regarding the option to pick up a Chromebook at their student’s school between April 7-9. Our middle and high school students have school-issued Chromebooks to help with in-home learning. Families in need of this support, please contact your child’s principal.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Online Access for In-Home Learning</strong><br>
Many students are accessing in-home learning through a Learning Management System (LMS), either Canvas or Google Classroom, which they can access through our <a href="https://login.rentonschools.us/">RSD Login Portal</a>. Families can gain access to the LMS in the following ways, where they will be able to “observe” some of their student’s assignments and activity, but not interact with content or with the students:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Canvas Family Access</strong><br>
Family members can gain access to Canvas classes as an “observer” (more information<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/tr-learncanvas/docs/CanvasObserverVisibilityandParticipation.pdf"> here</a>). To sign up as an observer, please follow the directions in this<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2wd46cgccwTejeRL7yMY1z-TtD_7boRonK2gL3fCzw/edit"> document</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Google Classroom Family Access</strong><br>
Family members can access information from Google Classroom in two different ways:</p>

<ol dir="ltr">
<li>One option is for the classroom teacher to initiate an invite via a family member’s email. Once the family member accepts the invite, they will be provided a weekly message from Google Classroom, providing information on things like missing work, upcoming work and class activity.</li>
	<li>Another way to view the actual course that the student and teachers view, is for a family member to sit with their student, who will log into Google Classroom by going through the RSD login portal at login.rentonschools.us, select Google Classroom and navigate to the specific class they would like to view. This will allow for a conversation between a student and family members about the learning activities.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>High School Credits</strong><br>
We are committed to helping our seniors graduate on time, as well as keep all high school students on track to graduate. To this end, we will continue to monitor the guidance from OSPI and the State Board of Education (SBE) to determine how we will grade students and assign credit.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Specifically for seniors, as we shared last Friday, the SBE is scheduled to adopt new rules regarding the waiver of certain graduation requirements on April 8. We will provide updates after the SBE makes its decisions. Additionally, the Washington State Council of Presidents and Independent Colleges of Washington have released a statement for Class of 2020 admissions.<a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/icwashington.org/resource/resmgr/covid-19/fall_2020_admissionstatement.pdf"> Read it here.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Meals for Students</strong><br>
School meals will continue to be served even as Washington State Governor Jay Inslee has extended his “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order through May 4. Meals are available for students Monday-Friday, 11 a.m. to noon at the <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/students-families">following locations</a>. When picking up meals, please remember to practice good social distancing and stand at least six feet away from others.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meals are served at nearly every school in our district and at these community locations:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong><br>
While schools are scheduled to reopen on April 27, we believe that the Governor is likely to extend the closure--potentially for the remainder of the school year. We anticipate knowing the Governor’s decision very soon. Should this happen, we are prepared to adjust to any new guidance from OSPI and the Governor regarding the services we will provide in support of our students and families. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Finally, we want to thank all of our students and families for your grace and patience as we have worked to address the challenges resulting from the closure of our schools. We miss working directly with our students but are committed to making this experience as positive and productive as possible. Stay healthy and safe!</p>

			<p>Renton School District Families:</p>

<p>This week we began the work to support our students, families, and staff in a way that addresses the range of implications that a sudden school closure brings. As we adjust to the changing landscape of our daily lives and work, we acknowledge the disruption and uncertainty this health crisis is causing. We appreciate your resilience and patience as we navigate this unprecedented time together.</p>

<p>Here is some of the work we accomplished this week:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Custodial</strong><br>
This week we continued work to disinfect touchpoints throughout our schools. Next week we will move to a cleaning process much like our summer cleaning program: clean/extract carpets, refinish tile floors, and complete other deep cleaning tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Nutrition Services</strong><br>
Our Nutrition Services team is serving meals (breakfast and lunch) at each school location as well as four apartment complexes. The team has served about 5,000 meals this week and anticipate participation will increase in the coming days and weeks. We continue to work within social-distancing parameters as we serve these meals to continue to keep students and families safe.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Teachers &amp; Support Staff</strong><br>
School and district educators and support staff have been organizing in-home learning materials to help students and families continue their learning. Along with the district’s comprehensive<a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/nrZ03yUj3lJqlHW9bQCJ5g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVoSfP0QuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51cy9zdHVkZW50cy1mYW1pbGllc1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAAAfUXVeaxYBgVIfcmFuZHkubWF0aGVzb25AcmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51c1gEAAAAAQ~~"> Students &amp; Families webpage</a>, we’ve also created an in-home learning resource page on each school’s website where school staff will collaborate to place specific grade-level learning materials along with resources developed by therapists, counselors, and nurses. We'll communicate more about these pages when they're ready.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Childcare</strong><br>
Washington Governor Jay Inslee has directed school districts to work to provide free childcare services for children kindergarten-5th grade whose caretakers are first responders and essential health care workers. We recently surveyed our families to determine those who fall into these important life-supporting categories and are in need of this childcare assistance. We will soon be communicating with these families, with the intent to start childcare on Wednesday, March 25, 2020. Additionally, we’ve placed some resources for families in need of childcare on our<a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/nrZ03yUj3lJqlHW9bQCJ5g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVoSfP0QuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51cy9zdHVkZW50cy1mYW1pbGllc1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAAAfUXVeaxYBgVIfcmFuZHkubWF0aGVzb25AcmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51c1gEAAAAAQ~~"> Student and Families Support webpage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Coming Days</strong><br>
Things will very likely continue to change in the coming days and weeks as our state leadership and health care professionals become more adept at responding in these unprecedented circumstances. Superintendent Pattenaude and his Cabinet continue to meet multiple times per week through online sources with OSPI and county health care professionals to learn more about the plan ahead, and strategies for making up lost time with students. With these challenges comes opportunities and responsibility to remain patient, to extend grace, and to assume positive intent. The latest updates can be found on the <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/nrZ03yUj3lJqlHW9bQCJ5g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVoSfP0QuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51cy9zdHVkZW50cy1mYW1pbGllc1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAAAfUXVeaxYBgVIfcmFuZHkubWF0aGVzb25AcmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51c1gEAAAAAQ~~">District webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and patience as together we show our commitment, flexibility, and professionalism during this challenging time.</p>

			<p>Renton Families,</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding as we wrap up this week. We know that this transition to having schools closed for the next month and a half has created uncertainty and anxiety. While we do not have all of the answers as to what will happen over the next six weeks, we will continue to update you as we gain greater clarity from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI; state education office). </p>

<p>We will continue to work to provide essential services for our students and families during this <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/learning-and-teaching/health-services/coronavirus-covid-19">mandated school closure</a>. Here are updates on that work:</p>

<p><b>Meal Services</b><br>
Beginning Tuesday, March 17, 2020, meals will be available for <b>any child</b>, ages 1-18, in the front lot of <b>each Renton School</b> from <b>11:00 am to 12:00 pm daily</b> during the school week. We are committed to providing access to meals to help ensure that all students’ nutritional needs are met during the closure. Meals are “grab and go” - Students will not stay on-site to eat; meals are intended to be taken off campus and can be picked up through car windows.</p>

<p>Additionally, meals will be available at the following locations daily from 11:00 am to 12:00 pm daily:</p>

<p><b>Learning During Closure</b><br>
Renton Schools have provided resources for at-home learning during our closure. We are committed to providing equitable learning experiences for our students. These resources are intended to support skill maintenance and development. Paper copies were distributed to students at all schools on Friday, March 13 and directions posted on the <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/students-families">district website page for students and families</a>. Additional copies will be available at schools during meal service.</p>

<p>We worked with instructional leaders to develop the learning resources and guidelines regarding digital platforms, content, support structures, and shared resources. Our learning resources  outline developmentally appropriate learning opportunities for different ages of students, including many non-digital options for learning. At our secondary schools (grades 6-12), all students have a district-provided Chromebook (and district-provided internet hotspot as needed) which provides them access to online learning platforms in addition to offline learning activities. We are continuing to develop learning resources and strategies that can support students with various needs, especially special education and English language services. In all of these plans, there are equity considerations and impacts to families in terms of student learning support.</p>

<p><b>State Testing</b><br>
The state's education office (OSPI) is cancelling all state testing for the 2019-2020 school year. This includes the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA), the Washington Comprehensive Assessment of Science (WCAS), the Washington Access to Instruction and Measurement (WA-AIM), and WIDA Alternate ACCESS for English learners.</p>

<p><b>Childcare</b><br>
We are working with our local partners and with the state education office (Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction - OSPI), on clear guidance to provide childcare during the school closure. Details to follow.</p>

<p><b>Building, Field, Pool Use During Closure</b><br>
Our schools, buildings, fields and pools remain closed to outside organized teams/groups through the end of March.</p>

<p><b>Additional Information</b><br>
While‌ ‌the‌ ‌school‌ ‌district‌ ‌is‌ ‌closed,‌ ‌Public‌ ‌Health‌ ‌recommends‌ ‌that‌ ‌students‌ ‌stay‌ ‌home‌ ‌as‌ ‌much‌ ‌as‌ ‌possible‌ ‌and‌ ‌avoid‌ ‌large‌ ‌social‌ ‌gatherings‌ ‌in‌ ‌order‌ ‌to‌ ‌help‌ ‌to‌ ‌reduce‌ ‌the‌ ‌potential‌ ‌for‌ ‌transmission.‌ </p>

<p>We strongly urge families to follow the updated guidance from <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/news.aspx">King County Public Health</a> for social distancing and other precautions in an effort to slow the spread of this virus. </p>

<p>Thank you, again, for your flexibility and patience as our school district closes for the next six weeks. Even though the times are difficult and uncertain, we look forward to continuing to have the privilege of serving your students.</p>

			<p>Renton School District Families:</p>

<p>Following today’s new directive from Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, we will <strong>close all Renton School District schools beginning Monday, March 16 through Friday, April 24. </strong></p>

<p>The Governor’s Office states that a brief closure (two weeks or less) of schools is not enough to affect a change for the infection rate of the virus. Guidance from the Governor’s Office, based on known data and epidemiological modeling, is to close schools for this extended period of time.</p>

<p>We wanted to share information regarding the following essential services for students and families:</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast and Lunch Services</strong><br>
Breakfast and lunch will be available for children at select locations – details to follow for each school community.</p>

<p><strong>Student Medications</strong><br>
Student medications may be picked up by authorized family members on Friday, March 13 or Monday, March 16 during regular school hours.</p>

<p><strong>Learning During the Closure</strong><br>
Renton Schools are providing resources for at-home learning. These activities are intended to support skill maintenance and development. Paper copies of the learning resources will be distributed to students at all schools on Friday, March 13 and posted on the district website. Additional copies will also be available at breakfast and lunch sites.</p>

	<div class="fsElement fsContent" id="fsEl_32402" data-use-new="true">

				<div class="fsElementContent">
			<p>We are writing to inform our school community that Hazen High School will remain closed this week and will reopen on Thursday, March 19, 2020. <b>All other schools continue to remain open.</b> The decision regarding Hazen was informed by the most recent guidance provided by Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County and made out of an abundance of caution. Fourteen days is the incubation period for COVID-19 so Hazen will remain closed for 14 days from the date that students and staff were last on campus. Hazen High School staff will return to school on Wednesday, March 18 in preparation for students returning on Thursday. While the school is still closed, Public Health recommends that students and staff should stay home as much as possible and avoid large social gatherings in order to help to reduce the potential for transmission.</p>

<p>At this time, only one student at Hazen High School has been confirmed through laboratory testing to have COVID-19.  This student is no longer ill and has been cleared by their health care professionals to return to school. There have not been any additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Hazen. We provided information to Public Health about a small number of other students and staff reporting illness that could be consistent with COVID-19. Some of those have been tested; while some results have returned negative, other results are currently pending. The school has been cleaned and disinfected multiple times and poses no health risks.</p>

<p>Public Health followed-up with those individuals who have symptoms but is unable to determine if their illnesses are caused by COVID-19, influenza, or another cold virus as influenza and cold viruses cause similar symptoms as COVID-19.</p>

<p>During the closure, Nutrition Services will provide breakfast and lunch meals to Hazen students and adjustments to learning plans are being made.</p>

<p><b>At this time, Public Health continues to recommend that schools stay open to provide important services to students.</b></p>

<p>As COVID-19 spreads through King County, there is the potential that there may be a new diagnosis in the near and ongoing future. Should this happen, we will work with Public Health regarding next steps. Any future school closures will be based on the context of that specific situation.</p>

<p><b>What should students, staff, and volunteers do if they feel sick?</b></p>

<p>All students, staff, and volunteers who feel sick with any illness should stay home and avoid going to school or public areas. In particular, those experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath should self-isolate at home and call their healthcare provider immediately. Self-isolation means separating yourself from other people and animals in your home by staying in a specific room and using a separate bathroom, if possible. If you have a face mask available, wear it when you have to be around other people. Please do not visit your healthcare provider or an emergency department without calling ahead if you have concerns about COVID-19. This will help protect other people from being exposed.</p>

<p>As the health situation evolves in King County, the Renton School District continues to review and update our emergency operations plan so that we can be best prepared for the possibility of more local cases. We will continue to update our <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/learning-and-teaching/health-services/coronavirus-covid-19">Coronavirus (COVID-19) page</a>. Again, we want to express our appreciation for your patience and feedback as we respond to the daily challenges COVID-19 presents to us as a learning organization and a community.</p>

			<p>Renton School District Families, Students, Staff, and Community,</p>

<p>During a press conference this morning, Governor Inslee directed districts to create contingency plans to address essential services such as nutrition and medical services should we be forced to close our schools. This afternoon, I have a conference call with the Governor and superintendents in King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties to discuss how we can take a coordinated approach to combating the Coronavirus and flatten the size of the epidemic peak.</p>

<p>Since last week, our leadership team and I have been in constant communication with Public Health - Seattle &amp; King Co., superintendents throughout the region, and OSPI regarding decisions facing our school districts. This work has allowed us to proactively plan for many of the areas the Governor discussed in his press conference including providing breakfast and lunch as well as potential childcare options.</p>

<p>I want to express sincere gratitude for our staff and families as we face this challenge together. Additionally, I want to assure you that our team is committed to the health and safety of our students, staff, families, and community. We will continue to update you on a regular basis.</p>

			<p>Renton School District Families:</p>

<p>As our district continues to work through these challenging times, we really appreciate everyone coming together to support the health and wellness of our community.</p>

<p>Our school and district maintenance staff were proactive and ordered adequate supplies of paper towels, bathroom tissue, soap, and other supplies in order to maintain the cleanliness of our schools.</p>

<p>The Renton School District continues to partner with Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County to make the best decisions for our students, families, and staff. While we have a few updates to provide, we would also like to communicate that Hazen will remain closed Tuesday, March 10. As Public Health continues to collect more information, we hope to be able to provide additional clarification tomorrow, March 10. We understand that it is frustrating to receive a daily update without knowing the long-term status and we are sorry for the challenges this presents to families and staff.</p>

<p>Please refer to yesterday’s comprehensive update on our <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/BrIcB5fStfgPBkzZ8qNWdw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgSCIiP0RXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51cy9sZWFybmluZy1hbmQtdGVhY2hpbmcvaGVhbHRoLXNlcnZpY2VzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWNvdmlkLTE5VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAKLuZl7AbTmtUh9yYW5keS5tYXRoZXNvbkByZW50b25zY2hvb2xzLnVzWAQAAAAB">Coronavirus (COVID-19) page</a>, posted under Communications, March 8, 2020. Additionally, we wanted to share the following:</p>

<p><strong>Spring Sports</strong><br>
New guidance about spring sports has been provided from the Washington Interscholastic Athletics Association (WIAA), the state’s high school athletics association, providing districts to alter practice schedules and add practices based on individual school circumstances. Additionally, WIAA is providing schools, school districts, and leagues more leeway in determining game schedules. Renton School District’s Athletics Department will work with coaches to implement these adjustments to spring sports.</p>

<p><strong>Online Learning</strong><br>
We’ve received questions around remote (online) learning. OSPI, the state's education office, does not recommend moving to online learning for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>All students would need to be able to access content and learning supports, including students who receive special education and/or English learning services</li>
	<li>Attendance for both students and staff would not be accurately tracked.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Volunteers</strong><br>
At this time, volunteers who are healthy are welcome to continue to support our schools. However, anyone who is not feeling well or is in any of the high-risk groups should consult with their health provider to make decisions about their attendance in public gatherings.</p>

<p>As the health situation outbreak evolves in King County, the Renton School District continues to review and update our emergency operations plan so that we can be best prepared for the possibility of more local cases. We will continue to update our <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/BrIcB5fStfgPBkzZ8qNWdw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgSCIiP0RXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVudG9uc2Nob29scy51cy9sZWFybmluZy1hbmQtdGVhY2hpbmcvaGVhbHRoLXNlcnZpY2VzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWNvdmlkLTE5VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAKLuZl7AbTmtUh9yYW5keS5tYXRoZXNvbkByZW50b25zY2hvb2xzLnVzWAQAAAAB">Coronavirus (COVID-19) page</a>.

			<p> Renton School District Families,</p>

<p>As we prepare for the week ahead, we want to acknowledge the important role everyone plays in a situation like the one we are facing. We are incredibly appreciative of our staff’s hard work and commitment to our students and families during these unsettling times. Additionally, we are thankful for the feedback you have provided as we endeavor to keep you safe and informed through this ever-evolving situation. We continue to partner with Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County to make decisions based on the safety, health, and well-being of all our students and staff. We are deeply appreciative of our families and staff and of their efforts to support our students every day, and we appreciate your continued patience and flexibility during this unprecedented time.</p>

<p>We will continue to provide updates to you as we learn more throughout this week, and please know that considerations about how best to keep students, families, and staff healthy and informed are guiding our work in this very dynamic situation. Until then, we have provided a current summary below in an effort to condense the current guidance in a single place.</p>

<p><b>New Guidance from Public Health</b></p>

<ul>
<li>While Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County continues to recommend that schools remain open at this time, it recently released revised guidelines for self-quarantining related to COVID-19 (coronavirus). More specifically:</li>
	<li>If you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19: Stay in home isolation for 7 days OR until 72 hours after your fever has resolved and symptoms get better, whichever is longer.</li>
	<li>If you have COVID-19 symptoms but haven’t been around anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19: Stay in home isolation and avoid others for 72 hours after your fever goes down and symptoms get better.</li>
	<li>Public Health is also recommending, but not requiring, that people at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. People at higher risk were identified as:
	<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>People 60 and older</li>
		<li>People with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease or diabetes</li>
		<li>People who have weakened immune systems</li>
		<li>People who are pregnant</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more complete guidance, please refer to the <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/news/2020/March/5-suspected-covid.aspx">King County Public Health website</a>.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning Efforts to Mitigate Exposure to COVID-19</b><br>
Custodial managers have been working closely with school and building custodial staff to ensure daily disinfecting is occurring on common “touch-points” at all of our facilities. These include door handles/knobs, light switches, sink/faucet handles, drinking fountains, paper towel dispensers, stair rails, restroom stall handles, toilet flush handles, elevator push buttons, and countertops.</p>

<p>Additionally, busses are being cleaned when returning from AM, midday, and PM runs with a particular focus on handrails, seats, and windows.</p>

<p>Washington State Department of Health provides two documents with helpful information on school cleaning practices:  <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/Pubs/333-233.pdf">Guidance for Healthy Classrooms</a> and <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/Schools/EnvironmentalHealth/ClassroomCleaning">Classroom Cleaning Tips for Teachers</a>. One important piece of information is understanding the difference between Cleaning (removes dirt and most germs, think “soap and water”), Sanitizing (reduces germs to safe levels, for example in food service environments and should only be done by staff), and Disinfecting (kills most germs per given directions and should only be done by custodial staff with proper personal protective equipment).</p>

<p>Please keep in mind, students should never use disinfectants. Disinfectant wipes shouldn't be used to clean hands. This includes Clorox (bleach) wipes.</p>

<p><b>Athletics</b><br>
At this time, school-related team sports practices will continue (with the exception of Hazen High School). We’re in ongoing communication with our athletic leagues to determine how we will manage spring sports. Athletic events are an evolving situation as surrounding school districts are also amending their plans each day.</p>

<p><b>Evening School Events</b><br>
Effective March 9, information nights, STEM nights, concerts, dances, plays, etc. are cancelled through March 22. We will continue to monitor this situation and may extend these cancellations if warranted.</p>

<p><b>Facility-Use</b><br>
Consistent with the emergency proclamations declared by the City of Renton and King County in response to COVID-19, coronavirus, Renton School District is cancelling all external groups from using school district facilities through March 15. School based programs/organizations (e.g., Right At School, PTA, BSK) will continue to be allowed to use district facilities. Only external groups that rent/use facilities for their programs are affected by the new rule. We will continue to monitor this situation and may extend facilities-use cancelations if warranted.</p>

<p><b>Remote Learning (or Online Learning)</b><br>
At this time, we will not be moving to a remote learning model. We will support students who are out of school for extended absences due to a documented illness or quarantine/isolation, and teachers will work with students and families regarding coursework. We currently leverage many digital tools to support in-class learning, however replacing in-person classroom learning with remote learning for all students in the district presents several challenges. Schools serve students and families in capacities beyond instruction, including nutrition services, counseling services, etc., and closing on short notice presents many regulatory, logistical, and equity challenges.</p>

<p><b>Meals for Students</b><br>
We are reviewing options, such as “pop-up” meal services in school parking lots or nearby parks to provide meals for students should schools be closed (or should the entire district have to close).  These programs would run much like our summer meal program, providing easy access to grab-and-go meals.</p>

<p><b>Hazen High School</b><br>
As we continue our work with Public Health—Seattle &amp; King County with this evolving situation, Hazen High School will remain closed on Monday, March 9. We will provide an update tomorrow regarding the status of Hazen.</p>

<p>We continue to make these decisions based on the safety, health, and well-being of all our Highlander students, staff, and families. We appreciate their continued patience and flexibility during this unprecedented time.</p>

<p><b>Notifications</b><br>
In the event that the decision is made to close school, you will be notified using the same channels that we use for notice of other emergency closures (i.e., closures due to inclement weather). If there are any decisions made to close schools, we will inform our community immediately via School Messenger, our<a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/"> district website</a>, and our official social media channels:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/renton.schools"> Facebook</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/Renton_Schools"> Twitter</a>, and<a href="https://www.instagram.com/rentonschools/"> Instagram</a>.</p>

<p><b>Stay Connected</b><br>
Our decisions may change as this situation evolves. We are committed to providing you with timely and accurate updates. We will continue to update our <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/learning-and-teaching/health-services/coronavirus-covid-19">Coronavirus (COVID-19) page</a>. </p>

<p>Again, we want to express our appreciation for your continued flexibility, patience, and understanding. We care deeply about all Renton students, families, and staff and will continue to share information and decisions as promptly as possible. Thank you for your care for one another and yourselves during this time.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Damien Pattenaude, Ed.D.<br>
Superintendent</p>

			<p>Renton School District Family:</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued patience during this evolving situation. This message provides an update on Renton School District’s work, in close consultation with Public Health Seattle &amp; King County, as we respond to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) together. We are monitoring the changing circumstances and continue to rely on guidance from our county and state public health offices. As with all our work, student and staff safety is our highest priority.</p>

<p>In our meeting today with Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County, we worked together through their guidance aimed at reducing the risk of exposure and slowing the spread of COVID-19, specifically in schools.</p>

<p><b>Here are their latest guidelines:</b></p>

<p>“While we recognize that these recommendations impact members of your communities in profound ways, at this time, we are not recommending closing schools. Health officials from Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) weighed this decision very carefully. The available data about novel coronavirus cases has shown that children have not been high risk<i> </i>groups for serious illness from this virus.</p>

<p>We know that schools are doing the important work of educating our children, and we don’t want to disrupt that unless there are known novel coronavirus exposure risks. We also know that school closures have other impacts on working parents and can be disruptive and costly for families.”</p>

<p><b>Again, Public Health is not recommending closing schools at this time.</b> If there is a confirmed case of COVID-19, Public Health will work with us to determine the best measures including school closure, as occurred at Hazen High. As much as possible, schools should remain open to conduct the important work of educating students.</p>

<p>As of today, we do not plan on cancelling events or gatherings (with the exception of Hazen). Families should consider their own potential risk to decide for themselves whether participating or attending is right for them. </p>

<p>We continue to review our cleaning protocols in context of the recommendations from the Washington State Department of Health and our practices are aligned. That said, we have revived campaigns in our schools and departments around excellent hygiene and handwashing.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to be mindful of accurate sources of information. We are updating information relevant to our district on our<a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/learning-and-teaching/health-services/coronavirus-covid-19"> coronavirus website</a>. The Health Department and CDC continue to be the most accurate source of information in our region.</p>

<p>We are committed to providing you with timely and accurate updates on the best recommendations and guidance from our public health authorities.</p>

<p>I want to extend my deep appreciation and gratitude to our school staff as they work hard to make schools a safe and positive learning place for our students.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Damien Pattenaude, Ed.D.<br>
Superintendent</p>

			<p>Renton School District received word late tonight from Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County that late today they received a positive COVID-19 test result for a student at Hazen High School. The student is at home recovering. <br><br>
While initially Public Health recommended that Hazen High remain open regardless of test results, they now recommend we close Hazen High School for the remainder of this week as they work to determine who, if anybody, came in contact with the ill student to ensure it is safe for students and staff to return to school.</p>

<p>All other Renton schools remain open on regular schedule.<br><br>
We understand this guidance has changed and recognize the hardship this places on our students and families. Our top priority is to ensure the safety of our school community. School will be closed through the end of this week. Public Health will provide us with guidance for the following week. All athletics practices are also canceled for now.<br><br>
We will provide more information to families and staff as we work through this process with Public Health and the CDC.</p>

While the family has yet to receive results of their testing, we’re confident <em>about the process in place to have school ready for all students and staff and to help keep our community safe. </em>We continue to work with Public Health Seattle &amp; King County and during our conversations they have recommended not closing schools.</p>

<p>Renton School District Community:</p>

<p>Early this morning, we learned from the parent of a Hazen student that the parent and their student are experiencing flu-like symptoms and were tested yesterday for COVID-19, Coronavirus. They are self-quarantined at home while awaiting results of the test. The parent works in the healthcare industry and became sick last Sunday. The student became sick Wednesday afternoon and did not attend school on Thursday or Friday.</p>

<p>Once learning about this situation, we immediately contacted Public Health Seattle &amp; King County. Out of an abundance of caution, we will close Hazen High School on Monday, March 2<sup>nd</sup>.  We have mobilized our custodial staff to begin thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting Hazen. Additionally, we will contact the families of those students and staff that the student may have come into contact with last week.  Beyond Hazen High School, our maintenance department remains focused on having custodians routinely cleaning frequently touched surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, countertops, etc.) and will provide disposable wipes for classrooms.</p>

<p>The safety of our students and staff is our priority. In partnership with Public Health Seattle &amp; King County, we will take the necessary precautionary steps as our community faces this health challenge. For additional information regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) as well as preventative tips and resources, please visit our <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/learning-and-teaching/health-services/coronavirus-covid-19">Coronavirus webpage</a>.</p>

<p>We will continue to monitor the situation and update you as we have more information. If you have any questions, please e-mail <a href="mailto:community.relations@rentonschools.us">community.relations@rentonschools.us</a>.</p>

<p>Renton Schools Families:</p>

<p>As questions arise about the potential spread of coronavirus in the United States, we want to share information with our families and staff about how Renton School District is responding. The district is closely monitoring information about coronavirus and is working in collaboration with state and local health officials. It’s important to note that there are no reports of coronavirus in Renton School District, and coronavirus (COVID-19) is not at all connected to race, ethnicity or nationality.</p>

<p>Our Director of Health Services is participating in meetings and briefings with the Washington State Department of Health and Public Health–Seattle &amp; King County in conjunction with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. She is providing frequent updates to our school nurses, school leadership, and others across the district.</p>

<p>Renton Schools follows recommendations from health officials and has existing practices for cleaning, handwashing and student illness. As with any illness, its vitally important that students and staff stay home when they are sick. The three primary symptoms of coronavirus are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Health officials say the general public do not need masks; instead, people should use good hygiene practices including frequent washing of hands, coughing into elbows, and staying home when sick. Each year during the height of influenza season, custodians conduct cleaning that includes disinfecting student desks, doorknobs, staircase rails and countertops. Health officials recommend continuing to use cleaners already in use.</p>

<p>The health and safety of our students and staff are of upmost importance to all of us in the Renton School District. We will continue to work at the district level to ensure we are planning appropriate precautionary steps while we work through this health and safety challenge.</p>

<p>More information about coronavirus (COVID-19) is available at <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus">www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus</a> or by calling the Department of Health at 1-800-525-0127 and press #.</p>

			<p>February 5, 2020:</p>

<p>Renton Schools is working closely with Public Health Seattle &amp; King County to stay informed of the most current information and recommendations regarding the coronavirus. The health and safety of our students, staff, families and community is top priority as we work the Health Department in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in rapid response to coronavirus.</p>

<p>Current risk to our communities and throughout the U.S. remains low. Currently, there are a small number of cases in the U.S. The CDC does not believe “transient contacts” such as passing by someone in the grocery store or standing near them at the gas station, are likely exposures.</p>

<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that all travelers from China (including school students, staff and volunteers) arriving in the U.S. <strong>AFTER</strong> February 2, 2020 at 2 p.m. stay at home away from others and monitor their health for 14 days. There is no recommendation for asymptomatic persons arriving before this time to restrict their activities. All travelers from China arriving <strong>BEFORE</strong> February 2, 2020 at 2 p.m. can continue to attend school.</p>

<p>Since the virus is not widely spread in the U.S, there are no additional precautions recommended for the general public.</p>

<p><strong>Steps you can take to prevent the spread of coronavirus are the standard illness prevention steps.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with warm water and soap. If no water is available, use hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands</li>
	<li>Cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue or sleeve and then wash your hands</li>
	<li>Stay home if sick, keep sick children home and avoid close contact with others</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces. Follow instructions on the product label for disinfectants, and check that the product is registered with the EPA.</li>
	<li>If you do visit a clinic and have any respiratory symptoms, call before going to the clinic</li>
</ul>

			<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people and others circulating among animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people. Previous coronavirus outbreaks have included severe acute respiratory syndrome (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html">SARS</a>) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html">MERS</a>). The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> believes the risk to the American public of becoming infected with this novel coronavirus is currently low. Because this is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation, the CDC will provide <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html">updated information</a> as it becomes available, including any changes in the risk assessment.</p>

			<p>Symptoms of coronavirus are similar to flu or colds and may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Runny nose</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Cough</li>
	<li>Sore throat</li>
	<li>Fever</li>
	<li>A general feeling of being unwell</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been notified by public health authorities that you may have been exposed, please follow instructions provided by <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus" target="_blank">Public Health Seattle &amp; King County</a>.</p>

<p>Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through:</p>

<ul>
<li>The air by coughing and sneezing</li>
	<li>Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands</li>
	<li>Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands</li>
	<li>Rarely, fecal contamination with coronavirus present</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we have a lot to learn about this virus, it is currently believed that it spreads like other respiratory viruses- by people with the infection coughing and sneezing. These droplets are inhaled by other people or moved to the eyes, nose or mouth by contaminated hands.</p>

<p>You can reduce the risk of spreading coronaviruses by taking the same steps as you would to prevent infection from the flu and the common cold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for a least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer, with 60-95% alcohol if water is not available.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home while you are sick and avoid close contact with others.</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately dispose of the used tissue.</li>
</ul>

			<p>Health officials say students and staff can reduce their risk of contracting and spreading viral respiratory infections, including the flu and the common cold, by taking simple steps which will also prevent COVID-19. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Staying home when they are sick.</li>
	<li>Frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after they blow their nose. Help young children do the same. If hands are visibly dirty, use soap and water to clean hands.</li>
	<li>If soap and water are not readily available, using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
	<li>Advising persons to avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Following the school's routine cleaning and disinfection program. Emphasizing to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
	<li>Covering coughs or sneezes with a tissue, then throwing the tissue in the trash and cleaning hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer (if soap and water are not readily available).</li>
	<li>Urging students and staff to get a flu shot during the flu season.</li>

<li>Door Handles / Knobs</li>
	<li>Door Push Bars</li>
	<li>Light Switches</li>

	<li>Counter Tops</li>
	<li>Elevator Control Buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>Products used include:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Virex, an EPA certified disinfectant with ammonium compounds found in household cleaners that are designed to kill germs. The same cleaning materials used in healthcare facilities where cleaning and prevention of cross-contamination are critical. Bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal. Kills MRSA and VRE.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Oxivir, accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide kills common pathogens, critical viruses and bacteria in the healthcare environment. Effective for soft surface sanitizing, and is non-irritating to eyes and skin, and requires no safety warnings.</p>

<p>Disinfecting is the responsibility of school custodial staff. They are trained to use disinfectants in a safe and effective manner and to clean up potentially infectious materials and body fluid spills – blood, vomit, feces, and urine.</p>

			<p>Public health agencies currently do not recommend that people wear masks when they are in public. This is because the immediate health risk to the general public in Washington is currently low. Additionally, scientists are not sure whether wearing a mask in public actually keeps healthy people from getting sick.  It’s most important for people who are sick to wear a mask in a healthcare setting (such as a waiting room) to avoid exposing other people when they cough or sneeze.</p>

<p>In some parts of the world, mask use is customary. People wear masks often for a variety of reasons, including to avoid pollen and  air pollution, as a courtesy to others when they have the common cold, and for other cultural and even social reasons.</p>

<p>Public Health — Seattle &amp; King County recommends staying home and away from others if you are sick. However, keep in mind that if we see our friends, neighbors or other community members wearing a mask we should not assume that they have been exposed to coronavirus or any other illness (coronavirus is not currently present in our community). Because mask use is customary in some cultures, it’s not appropriate to make assumptions about why someone is wearing a mask or to stigmatize or discriminate against people who choose to wear masks.</p>

			<p>If you are sick, you should take steps you normally would when sick, including focusing on caring for your health, contacting your healthcare provider if you feel you need to, not attending class if contagious, and in the event you miss class due to illness, working with your instructor on any necessary arrangements for making up coursework.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms — such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath — within 14 days of your return from personal or official travel to a country with a COVID-19 outbreak OR have been exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19, please take the steps listed below.</p>

<p>If you have<strong> NOT </strong>returned in the past 14 days from travel to a country with a COVID-19 outbreak OR have<strong> NOT</strong> been exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19 but do have fever and respiratory symptoms, please also take the following steps.</p>

<p><strong>First: </strong>Call your health provider in advance. <strong>Please do not show up at a clinic, urgent care or other health facility without calling first. </strong>Your provider will need to take special measures to protect other people in the clinic.</p>

<p><strong>The CDC also advises you to:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid contact with others and do not travel while sick.</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.</li>
	<li>Clean your hands by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol immediately after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitor your symptoms closely.</strong> Remember that the likelihood is low that you have coronavirus. Take your temperature if you believe you have a fever.</p>

<p><strong>Stay home from school and work</strong> until at least 24 hours after your fever ends. If you must go out of the house or be around others, wear a mask and avoid close contact. Be especially careful around infants and small children as well as people who have compromised immune systems and/or are over the age of 65. If you returned from China in the last 14 days, and your arrival date was February 2 or later, you will have received instructions from the CDC and from the local or state health department. Please follow these instructions. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">Guidelines for travelers returning from other countries are available from the CDC</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Take care of yourself.</strong> Rest as much as possible. Drink lots of fluids.</p>

<p>Even if you haven’t returned from one of these countries, if you have respiratory illness plus a fever you could have the flu or another virus. <strong>Please contact your healthcare provider or nurse advice line before going to a clinic or doctor’s office.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Additional note for anyone arriving recently from China:</strong> Based on CDC guidance, if you have arrived in the U.S. on or after Feb. 3, 2020 <strong>AND</strong> visited mainland China in the previous 14 days, you should stay at home and not attend class  until a full 14 days have passed since your last day in mainland China.</p>

			<h5>Governor Inslee announces schools closed for remainder of 2019-2020 school year</h5>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">Today, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced that schools across the state will be closed for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year in order to slow the spread of COVID-19, the coronavirus. During this closure, all schools in our district will remain closed. </p>

<p dir="ltr">We acknowledge continued school closures present many challenges for students, staff, families, and the entire community. This is difficult news for all of us: students miss their friends and teachers, and we miss our students. While staff across our district are demonstrating their professional and personal commitment to our students in meaningful and inspiring ways, we understand that this extended closure also raises numerous questions for students and families. We have been working for the past several weeks to provide education in a different, sustainable model; and we will continue to work to provide answers to questions brought by this new directive. In the meantime, here is what we know now:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
<li>In-home learning will continue in the same format as long as schools are closed. School principals will continue to provide updated in-home learning content each Friday on school websites. More information can also be found on the <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/students-families">district website</a>. We are committed to continuing to partner with families and community to support our students’ learning while they are at home.</li>
	<li>Elementary school families were recently sent information regarding the option to pick up a Chromebook at their student’s school between April 7-9. Our middle and high school students have school-issued Chromebooks to help with in-home learning. Families in need of this support, please contact your child’s principal.</li>
	<li>High school seniors will receive support from guidance counselors regarding opportunities to earn and document credits they need for post-secondary transitions. We are working with the state’s college system to ensure smooth transitions.</li>
	<li>We will continue to provide meals <a href="https://www.rentonschools.us/students-families">at these locations</a>, Monday through Friday.</li>
	<li>Childcare will continue to be available in a limited capacity for children of first responders and healthcare workers.</li>
	<li>All field trips and events, including sports, socials, and dances, will be cancelled during the extended closure. Schools will engage with students to come up with creative alternatives to celebrate milestones such as prom. We will keep students and families updated on these decisions.</li>
	<li>Based on the Governor’s comments during his press conference, we will continue to explore options related to graduation ceremonies. More information to follow.</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">We are awaiting information from the Governor on whether school facilities will be open to provide summer school.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h5 dir="ltr">Continue to keep one another safe &amp; healthy </h5>

<p dir="ltr">Please, stay home and stay healthy. Staying home and limiting person-to-person contact appears to be making a difference in slowing the spread of COVID-19, but those measures need to continue in order to be effective long-term. As much as possible, stay home, limit trips outside for groceries, gas and essentials, and stay 6 feet apart from people outside of your home. Additionally:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces.</li>
	<li>Stay at home away from others if you are sick.</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The need to close schools for the remainder of a school year is an unprecedented move, in unprecedented times. Our commitment is to continue to work to support our students and embrace the opportunity to stay connected with them to strengthen relationships and reinforce a sense of normalcy. While these are tough times, we will get through it together. </p>
