<p> </p>

<p>Dear Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>I hope you are off to a good start this week. At his press conference this afternoon, Governor DeWine announced that an executive order would be coming to extend the closure of K-12 school buildings to students through the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. With that decision, Wyoming City Schools will continue with our current remote learning plan.</p>

<p>We are continuing to consider options for school-related events that will comply with state orders and will communicate about individual events as we are able. In the coming days, I will also be sharing information about 4th quarter grades and emotional support resources for students and families.</p>

<p>Though it’s difficult to think that classes will definitely not take place in our buildings next month, I’m reminded of all the work students, staff members, and families have done to this point and I’m optimistic about our community’s ability to work together to continue to support our students in the coming days.</p>

<p>Have a good evening,</p>

<p>Tim Weber</p>

<p>Superintendent</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Posted April 9</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dear Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>I hope you’ve had a good week. On Monday, we will shift into a different phase of remote education, which will include more online opportunities for learning.  Because this next phase looks a little different at each level, please reach out to your child’s teachers and principal if you have specific questions regarding this plan. I truly appreciate the efforts being made by our staff, our families, and, in particular, our students. The past several weeks have been difficult for everyone and I’m looking forward to the day that our students are once again in our school buildings.</p>

<p><strong>What does a week of learning look like in the second phase of the Remote Education Plan?</strong></p>

<p>The second phase of remote learning will include more online opportunities for learning and connecting with others in grades 2-12. (Kindergarten and first grade will continue to use paper packets.) </p>

<p>The basic structure of our plan: </p>

<ul>
<li>Teachers will provide the learning plan for the entire week each Monday. We hope that sharing these materials at the beginning of each week will allow families to structure their weeks in a personalized way for each household.</li>
	<li>Teachers will have office hours 9-11 a.m. for students and families each instructional day. During office hours, teachers will be online and ready to respond to students through email and Canvas. The goal during this time is to answer questions and provide immediate feedback and support on the week’s assignments.</li>
	<li>Afternoons will offer opportunities for online virtual instruction and student interaction.  Teachers will be in contact with students about how and when these opportunities will occur. With the difficulty that many families face with their unique schedules, our hope is for students to be able to participate in real-time virtual discussions but understand that some student schedules might be in conflict with these sessions and, therefore, these sessions are not required.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact your child’s teacher with any questions you have regarding their weekly plan for students.  </p>

<p><strong>I do not have a parent Canvas account. How do I get a parent account to Canvas (Wyoming’s learning management system)?</strong></p>

<p>Please use this link to access instructions on <a href="https://www.wyomingschools.org/docs/district/canvas/canvas%20parent%20sign%20in%20-%20desktop.pdf?id=376">How to Create a Canvas Account</a>. Instructions on <a href="https://www.wyomingschools.org/docs/district/canvas/how%20to%20get%20an%20oberver%20pairing%20code.pdf?id=377">How to Get an Observer Pairing Code</a> and <a href="https://www.wyomingschools.org/docs/district/canvas/adding%20additional%20students%20to%20parent%20account.pdf?id=378">How to Add Additional Students to a Canvas Parent Account</a> are also available. If you are in need of additional assistance, please email Assistant Superintendent Dr. Ashley Whitely at <a href="mailto:whitelya@wyomingcityschools.org">whitelya@wyomingcityschools.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What should I do if I have difficulties with my child’s district-issued laptop device?</strong></p>

<p>Please email your child’s teacher a detailed description of any problems you may have with the district-issued laptop device you are using. Teachers will then create a help-desk ticket and our technology staff will work with you to resolve any issues.  </p>

<p><strong>What is the plan for the K-1 packet pickup scheduled for April 13?</strong></p>

<p>Paper packets will be available for kindergarten and first-grade students through <strong>curbside pickup 9 a.m.-noon Monday, April 13</strong>, at Wyoming High School. Please pull into the horseshoe drive at the front of the building during designated times. Prior to arrival, please write your child’s name on a piece of paper. To limit congregating and personal interactions, please come to paper packet pickup in a vehicle. The parent will pull up, show the piece of paper with the child’s name to the staff member at the curb, open the trunk, and the staff member will place the paper packet in the trunk of the car.</p>

<p><strong>Will lunches continue to be available during the second phase of the Remote Education Plan?</strong></p>

<p>Student meals will continue to be delivered to the front door of homes within the City of Wyoming with the delivery of breakfasts and lunches for five days happening each Tuesday. If a student has been receiving food, they will be on the delivery list going forward (no need to continue ordering). If a student has not been receiving food and would like to request delivery, orders must be placed by 9 a.m. on Monday each week. Cancellations will need to be made in this time frame, also. Meal orders and cancellations should be placed by calling Nutrition Services at 513-576-2290, 513-576-2291, or 513-576-2292. When calling, please say you are calling from Wyoming City Schools and leave your child’s name and address. <a href="https://www.wyomingcityschools.org/docs/district/covid-19/guidelines%20for%20handling%20delivered%20student%20meals.pdf?id=368" target="_blank">Guidelines for the handling of delivered food can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If your family’s financial situation has changed, please consider applying for free and reduced meals. This eligibility will extend to the beginning of next school year. Apply online at <a href="https://www.lunchapplication.com/" target="_blank">www.lunchapplication.com</a> or a paper application can be requested at 513-576-4160 or <a href="mailto:gregory_k@milfordschools.org">gregory_k@milfordschools.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How will 3rd quarter report cards be distributed?</strong></p>

<p>Third quarter report cards for grades 1-8 will be mailed to residences. (Kindergarten students do not receive a third quarter report card.) Third quarter reports cards for high school students will be available on ProgressBook. If you have any problems logging in to ProgressBook, please send an email to Education Management Information System (EMIS) Coordinator June Grubb at <a href="mailto:grubbj@wyomingcityschools.org">grubbj@wyomingcityschools.org</a>.</p>

<p>As we learn of other restrictions that come from Governor DeWine’s Office, we will continue to provide updates to you on how our plans are being modified to support students. We will also be sharing information on 4th quarter grading next week.</p>

<p>Thank you for the incredible support that you provide to your children and our schools! Our partnership is the difference-maker for all of our students. </p>

<p>Wishing you wellness and an enjoyable long weekend!</p>

<p><strong>Posted April 6</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dear Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>This week, teachers continue to be available to students through email/CANVAS and will be sharing enrichment resources for students and families looking for additional engagement opportunities to be used as desired. Students can also use this time to catch up on previously-assigned learning activities and check-in with teachers with any questions from previous material. Friday, April 10, is a previously scheduled non-school day. Remote direct instruction will begin again Monday, April 13, and will continue through Friday, May 1.</p>

<p>With a greater focus on online learning in 2nd-8th grade coming, we are providing a district-issued laptop for any student in these grades in need of a device for their home during this next phase of remote learning.  Curbside pickup for 2nd-8th grade students is taking <strong>until</strong> <strong>2 p.m. today, Monday, April 6, </strong>and <strong>noon-4 p.m. tomorrow, Tuesday, April 7.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>For 2nd-4th grade families: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Curbside laptop pickup will take place at Wyoming High School. </strong>Please pull into the horseshoe drive at the front of the building during designated times. Prior to arrival, please write Student Name, Student ID#, School Building Name, and Teacher Name on a piece of paper. Students should know this information, but assistance will be provided, if needed. When you arrive, please keep your window up and show the piece of paper to the staff member through the glass. <strong>For Primary Devices Only: </strong>When you and your student turn on the device for the first time, please select the WCS Student profile. You will then be prompted for a password; the password is: <strong>wyoming</strong>. Please reach out to your child’s teacher and/or principal with any questions that you have.</p>

<p><strong>For 5th-8th grade families: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Curbside laptop pickup will take place at Wyoming Middle School. </strong>Please pull up to the entrance on the west side of the building and follow the normal traffic patterns used for arrival and dismissal by car.  Prior to arrival, please write Student Name, Student ID#, Computer Cart#, and Computer Cart Slot# on a piece of paper. Students should know this information, but assistance will be provided, if needed. When you arrive, please keep your window up and show the piece of paper to the staff member through the glass.</p>

<p>Due to the Governor’s executive order, families cannot access the buildings at this time and parents must accompany their child when picking up the device. To limit congregating and personal interactions, please come to laptop pickup in a vehicle. The student and parent will pull up, show the requested information to the staff member at the curb, open the trunk, and the staff member will place the laptop in the trunk of the car.</p>

<p>Because Wyoming High School has a one-to-one laptop program in place, most high school students already have a district laptop and online instruction has been taking place over the past weeks.</p>

<p><strong>For kindergarten &amp; 1st grade families: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Paper packets will be available through curbside pickup 9 a.m.-noon Monday, April 13, at Wyoming High School</strong>. Please pull into the horseshoe drive at the front of the building during designated times. Prior to arrival, please write your child’s name on a piece of paper. To limit congregating and personal interactions, please come to paper packet pickup in a vehicle. The parent will pull up, show the piece of paper with the child’s name to the staff member at the curb, open the trunk, and the staff member will place the paper packet in the trunk of the car.</p>

<p><strong>Posted April 3</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dear Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>THANK YOU to our entire school community!  Our current environment is difficult for all of us in so many ways as we are flooded with concerns for everyone’s health, financial stability, connectedness to one-another, and our overall well being.  Even in these difficult times, there’s so many reasons to be thankful: students that long to connect with teachers and their peers, parents that are taking on additional roles in supporting their child’s learning, staff members who do whatever it takes to support student growth, a community that stops at nothing to support one another, and the list goes on and on.  It’s our connectedness that ensures we will get through this pandemic and continue to thrive as individuals, classrooms, teams, school buildings, and as a district and community.  Thank you for the many little things and big things that you do to make a difference for our students and staff!</p>

<p>This week, Governor Mike DeWine extended the closure of school buildings to students through Friday, May 1, 2020.  With this extension, our Remote Education Plan shifts to Phase 2 and an increase in online learning at some grade levels to support the need for educators and students to function from their homes.  Our goal continues to be to connect with students as we provide meaningful engagement and learning opportunities.  We recognize that this crisis is a significant challenge for our students, families, and our staff.  Now, more than ever, we are working to build community through connection.</p>

<p><strong>What happens next week and through May 1?</strong></p>

<p>Monday, April 6-Thursday, April 9 will look a little different than our previous Remote Education Plan weeks. During this time: </p>

<ul>
<li>Teachers will be available to students through email/CANVAS.</li>
	<li>At the start of the week, teachers will offer enrichment resources for students and families looking for additional engagement opportunities to be used as desired. </li>
	<li>Students can use this time to catch up on previously-assigned learning activities and check-in with teachers with any questions from previous material.</li>
	<li>We will be working to get computers to all students in grades 2-8 who would benefit from having access to a district device in their home. </li>
	<li>We will continue to prepare plans and materials that support online learning in grades 2-12. </li>
	<li>We will be preparing additional paper instructional materials for students in kindergarten and first grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Friday, April 10, is a previously scheduled non-school day. </p>

<p>Remote direct instruction will begin again Monday, April 13, and will continue through Friday, May 1.</p>

<p><strong>With a greater focus on online learning for my 2nd-8th grader, my household would benefit from having a district laptop in our home.</strong> <strong>How will I access the technology needed for online learning?</strong>  </p>

<p>We will provide a district-issued laptop for any student in these grades in need of a device during this time of remote learning.  Curbside pickup of laptops for 2nd-8th grade students will take place <strong>10 a.m.-2 p.m. Monday, April 6, </strong>and <strong>noon-4 p.m. Tuesday, April 7.</strong> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>For 2nd-4th grade families: </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Curbside laptop pickup will take place at Wyoming High School. </strong>Please pull into the horseshoe drive at the front of the building during designated times. Prior to arrival, please write Student Name, Student ID#, School Building Name, and Teacher Name on a piece of paper. Students should know this information, but assistance will be provided, if needed. When you arrive, please keep your window up and show the piece of paper to the staff member through the glass.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>For 5th-8th grade families: </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Curbside laptop pickup will take place at Wyoming Middle School. </strong>Please pull up to the entrance on the west side of the building and follow the normal traffic patterns used for arrival and dismissal by car.  Prior to arrival, please write Student Name, Student ID#, Computer Cart#, and Computer Cart Slot# on a piece of paper. Students should know this information, but assistance will be provided, if needed. When you arrive, please keep your window up and show the piece of paper to the staff member through the glass.</p>

<p>Due to the Governor’s executive order, families cannot access the buildings at this time and parents must accompany their child when picking up the device. To limit congregating and personal interactions, please come to laptop pickup in a vehicle. The student and parent will pull up, show the requested information to the staff member at the curb, open the trunk, and the staff member will place the laptop in the trunk of the car.</p>

<p>Because Wyoming High School has a one-to-one laptop program in place, most high school students already have a district laptop and online instruction has been taking place over the past weeks.</p>

<p>Please reach out to your child’s teacher and/or principal with any questions that you have.</p>

<p><strong>How will my kindergarten/first-grade child access their next paper packet?</strong></p>

<p>Paper packets will be available for kindergarten and first-grade students through <strong>curbside pickup 9 a.m.-noon Monday, April 13</strong>, at Wyoming High School. Please pull into the horseshoe drive at the front of the building during designated times.</p>

<p>To limit congregating and personal interactions, please come to paper packet pickup in a vehicle, if at all possible. Ideally, the student and parent will pull up, share the child’s name with the staff member at the curb, open the trunk, and the staff member will place the paper packet in the trunk of the car.</p>

<p><strong>We’re having a hard time keeping up with all the electronic messages. How will teachers communicate with my child and me going forward?</strong></p>

<p>We recognize that our current situation creates many unique challenges for families and that each family’s structure and needs are different.  Our goal is to continue to be in communication without overburdening families.  For this reason, we will shift away from daily direction to students and provide more detail at the beginning of each week so that families can organize their time in ways that best meet their individual needs.  Teachers will always be available to respond to questions, but we feel this new structure will alleviate the large number of emails that many families have been receiving daily.  </p>

<p><strong>How will the structure of a remote-learning day change going forward?</strong>  </p>

<p>The general structure of a remote-learning day starting on Monday, April 13, is below.  Individual teachers will provide greater detail as we begin to implement this new plan.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>First Day of Each Week</strong>: Teachers will share general learning expectations for the week.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>9-11 a.m. Daily Office Hours</strong>: Teachers will be online during this time ready to communicate with students and families through email and CANVAS.  The goal during this time is to answer questions and provide immediate feedback. This office time includes all educators: classroom teachers, special education, gifted education, English learners, counselors, etc.  </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Afternoons</strong>: Teachers will use this time to continue to check email and CANVAS and provide feedback to students. Teachers may also use this time to schedule online real-time engagement and/or lessons to work with students through Zoom or other online virtual meeting tools.  Individual teachers will share specific information for these types of learning opportunities directly with students and families.  </p>

<p><strong>What about my child who requires special education services?  </strong></p>

<p>Staff who provide services to our students with disabilities will make every effort to deliver the service minutes indicated in each student’s IEP utilizing the platforms available in a best faith effort. Your child’s intervention specialist will reach out to schedule times for lessons targeting your child’s goal(s). If you have specific individual questions, contact your child’s intervention specialist or Director of Pupil Services Dr. Tracy Quattrone.</p>

<p><strong>Will student lunches continue to be available when needed? </strong> </p>

<p>Student meals will continue to be delivered to the front door of homes within the City of Wyoming with the delivery of breakfasts and lunches for five days happening each Tuesday. If a student has been receiving food, they will be on the delivery list going forward (no need to continue ordering). If a student has not been receiving food and would like to request delivery, orders must be placed by 9 a.m. on Monday each week.

<p><strong>What is the district’s plan for special student events and activities, especially for seniors? </strong> </p>

<p>Sadly, this situation puts strict limits on the daily, in-person social interactions and activities that come with regular school attendance. This is especially difficult for our seniors and throws into question many of the 12th-grade culminating activities that Wyoming students and families look forward to at this time of year.  These events are incredibly important and we are working hard to establish alternative plans for any impacted special gatherings so that our students’ accomplishments can be recognized and celebrated by their families, teachers, and classmates.  More information will be shared about adjustments to specific events as it becomes available.  </p>

<p><strong>How do I continue to learn about COVID-19 and how to reduce risks for my family?  </strong></p>

<p>Hello Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>I hope you and your children were able to shift away from school-related concerns and toward taking care of each other during spring break last week.</p>

<p>At his press conference this afternoon, Governor DeWine announced that an executive order would be coming to extend the closure of K-12 school buildings to students through Friday, May 1. We have been planning for this extended closure and will share more information about Phase 2 of our Remote Education Plan shortly. Communication about the status of school-related events will follow, also. </p>

<p>This week (Monday, March 30-Friday, April 3), we will continue with instruction through electronic means and/or paper packets as we did the week prior to spring break. </p>

<p>Student meals will continue to be delivered to the front door of homes within the City of Wyoming this week with the delivery of breakfasts and lunches for five days happening each Tuesday. If a student has been receiving food, they will be on the delivery list going forward (no need to continue ordering). If a student has not been receiving food and would like to request delivery, orders must be placed by 9 a.m. on Monday each week. Cancellations will need to be made on this time frame, also. Meal orders and cancellations should be placed by calling Nutrition Services at 513-576-2290, 513-576-2291, or 513-576-2292. When calling, please say you are calling from Wyoming City Schools and leave your child’s name and address. <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/0IIBrn-59Ixt2iNyodtMnQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVN-qP0R-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3lvbWluZ2NpdHlzY2hvb2xzLm9yZy9kb2NzL2Rpc3RyaWN0L2NvdmlkLTE5L2d1aWRlbGluZXMlMjBmb3IlMjBoYW5kbGluZyUyMGRlbGl2ZXJlZCUyMHN0dWRlbnQlMjBtZWFscy5wZGY_aWQ9MzY4VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAACqsc14fMXNbUh1oZW5rZXNAd3lvbWluZ2NpdHlzY2hvb2xzLm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">Guidelines for the handling of delivered food can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If your family’s financial situation has changed, please consider applying for free and reduced meals. This eligibility will extend to cover the remainder of this school year and into the beginning of the next school year. Apply online at <a href="https://www.lunchapplication.com/" target="_blank">www.lunchapplication.com</a> or a paper application can be requested at 513-576-4160 or <a href="mailto:gregory_k@milfordschools.org">gregory_k@milfordschools.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to each staff member and every family of Wyoming City Schools. This global pandemic has forced all of us to adjust nearly every element of our lives and I’ve been amazed by the acts of support that I continue to see throughout our community. These acts of kindness and community-building, big and small, are extremely valuable now and will continue to benefit us when we are able to put this crisis behind us.</p>

<p>Hello Wyoming City Schools Families,<br>
 <br>
I hope you have found yourself with time to enjoy your families this week. It is my hope that our students, staff, and families have an opportunity to step away from our Remote Education Plan and focus on spending time with family members and taking care of one another.  <br><br>
Thank you to the entire Wyoming City Schools Staff for connecting with students in unique ways to continue engagement and learning.<br><br>
Thank you to all of our families for your engagement in this process. <br><br>
We realize these changes can be difficult for all of us to manage at times.  We’re continuing to work to make sure we carry on with student learning and engagement in ways that are manageable for families. Our current remote learning plan takes us through the end of the week of March 30th. We are planning for subsequent weeks now and will share more information on that topic after spring break.</p>

<p>This message and more information about food service during spring break, a change to our board meeting schedule, and other items can be found in our <a href="https://mailchi.mp/675ff2aa82a0/cowboy-club-march-school-chatter?e=a49a54a5dc" target="_blank">March newsletter</a>.<br>
 <br>
I hope you find ways to enjoy the rest of your week. I will continue to communicate, including any updates to our school closure status and changes to our Remote Education Plan, as we move forward.<br><br>
Sincerely, <br>
Tim Weber<br>

<p>Hello Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>A lot has happened this week. It was a week that included much uncertainty in our homes, in our schools, in our state, and in our world. It was a week filled with daily personal realizations of how this situation is currently impacting our world, our friends, our families, and ourselves, and that it will continue to impact us in the days to come.</p>

<p>It was also a week filled with extraordinary examples of people supporting each other. Our students are working to support each other while continuing to learn. Our families are working to support each other while tending to the daily essentials. Our staff members are working to support our students, our families, and each other while implementing Week 1 of our Remote Education Plan. Our community is working to support each of us and our neighbors. I am so lucky to be a part of Wyoming and so impressed to see how we build a safety net of support in trying times.</p>

<p>Next week is Spring Break for Wyoming City Schools. During Spring Break, we are stepping away from our Remote Education Plan. My hope is that we (our students, our families, and our staff) can use this time to care for ourselves and each other free of school-related concerns, as much as possible.</p>

<p>We plan to move to Week 2 of our Remote Education Plan on Monday, March 30. We are planning for subsequent weeks now and will share more information on that topic after Spring Break.</p>

<p>Wishing you a good Spring Break. Thank you for an extraordinary week,<br>
Tim Weber<br>
Superintendent<br>
Wyoming City Schools</p>

<p>Dear Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>Today, we find ourselves over halfway through our first week of remote teaching and learning. Though we are not together in our school buildings, I’m receiving so many messages of support with many examples of the impactful actions being taken by our entire Wyoming community of teachers, students, staff members, parents, first responders, and our neighbors. Wyoming is definitely a special place!  Thank you for your work in taking care of your families, yourselves, and each other. This is the number one task for all of us at this time.</p>

<p>As for teaching and learning, I am continuing to work closely with our district leadership, school board, educators, families, health departments, the City of Wyoming, and peer school districts to determine ways to improve our current remote education plan and plan for future contingencies. Each day, Governor DeWine shares additional state-wide directives and we are adjusting our current direction and future plans accordingly.</p>

<p>We are committed to educating the children of Wyoming and are currently on the following schedule:</p>

<p><b>Week of March 16:         Remote Education Plan Week 1</b></p>

<p><b>Week of March 23:         Spring Break</b></p>

<p><b>Week of March 30:         Remote Education Plan Week 2</b></p>

<p><b>What should we expect beyond the next three weeks?</b></p>

<p>We are planning for beyond the next three weeks, listening to the Governor, and identifying our options. One option may be to move away from paper packets and engage with students in electronic remote learning. We are asking all families to please take <a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/PjsiAyASnDmd7uTUYYYOqA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVN-qP0R1aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZm9ybXMvZC8xT3ZWNnJDS003b0NkTW9UX1UxcWxwU1ItZWxGVmpzX2RGdHBiUno0T09VZy92aWV3Zm9ybT90cz01ZTZmODg5NCZlZGl0X3JlcXVlc3RlZD10cnVlVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAACqsc14fMXNbUh1oZW5rZXNAd3lvbWluZ2NpdHlzY2hvb2xzLm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>this survey</b></a> now so we can gauge the feasibility of our options and continue to work to support our families.  It’s important for us to know what technology and internet access is available to each student.</p>

<p><b>What is the current plan for providing lunch for students?</b></p>

<p>Breakfast and lunch meals for students for off-site consumption will be available during spring break. </p>

All food orders are free of charge and will be delivered to the front door of homes within the City of Wyoming.

<p><b>Beyond the Remote Education Plan, what’s going on with student events and activities for the remainder of the school year?</b></p>

<p>The status of many important student events is uncertain at this time. Each event and activity is being considered and all necessary information will be shared as soon as possible.

<p>Dear Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>We have spent much time researching and monitoring the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation in our region and across the world the past several weeks. Every action we’ve taken has been after thoughtful consideration and deep discussions with many who are invested in both the education and well-being of our children. I have been working closely with our district leadership, school board, educators, families, health departments, and peer school districts to plan for a potential change from our daily routines.</p>

<p>Today, Governor DeWine announced that Ohio K-12 schools would be closed to students from Tuesday, March 17-Friday, April 3, and during this time period schools should work to provide education through alternative means.</p>

<p><b>Wyoming City Schools will be closed to students Monday, March 16-Friday, April 3</b>. We are slightly deviating from the Governor’s time frame because we are ready for remote learning and because this is a rapidly changing situation with the number of confirmed cases continuing to grow.  This decision was made through careful consideration and with the support of a variety of district and community leaders.</p>

<p>Students will be asked to take all instructional materials (textbooks, workbooks, devices, chargers, etc.) and other essential items with them at the close of school tomorrow. Parents and guardians may visit their child’s school to pick up and sign out student medication during regular school hours on Friday, March 13, or Monday, March 16.</p>

<p><b>Why am I making this decision?</b></p>

<p>I considered the messages that we are getting from our state government and health agencies, the information my team and I have been tracking since mid-February, and the rapidly changing situation over the past 48 hours.</p>

<p>We are working to minimize exposure of our students and staff by making sure that education continues outside the classroom. Public health recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 indicate that social distancing is the tool we have at this time.</p>

<p><b>What about the education of our children?</b></p>

<p>We are committed to educating the children of Wyoming and we are shifting our education beyond the classroom. We will be on the following schedule:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Friday, March 13:      Regular School Day</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Week of March 16:   Remote Education Plan Week 1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Week of March 23:   Spring Break</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Week of March 30:   Remote Education Plan Week 2</b></p>

<p>All remote education materials will be distributed to students tomorrow. This process will look different for primary students, middle school students and high school students. Communication will follow with specific information for your child(ren).</p>

<p><b>What about my child who requires special education services?</b></p>

<p>Instructional staff who provide services to our students with disabilities will make every effort to deliver the service minutes indicated in each student’s IEP utilizing the platforms available. When services return to the classroom setting, IEP teams can meet to determine if additional services are needed. </p>

<p><b>What about after-school and extracurricular activities?</b></p>

<p>After dismissal tomorrow, schools will be closed to all students and all school events and extracurricular activities are canceled until Friday, April 3. </p>

<p><b>What are the plans for providing lunch, if needed?</b></p>

<p>The state is working to develop a strategy for providing meals, while we are doing the same with our food service partner. We will share more details in a follow-up communication.</p>

<p><b>My child is worried about state assessments and AP exams. What can we do?</b></p>

<p>Our team is reaching out to the organizations involved to determine next steps. We will keep you informed of future developments.</p>

<p><b>How do I learn about COVID-19 and how to reduce risks for my family?</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.wyomingcityschools.org/Content/166"><b>This link provides information on the virus</b> <b>and how the Wyoming City School District has been preparing and communicating</b></a>.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the partnership of each student, parent, staff member, and community member as we continue to navigate this challenging situation together. </p>

<p>Dear Wyoming City Schools Families,</p>

<p>In anticipation of the Governor’s executive order addressing mass gatherings, Wyoming City Schools is cancelling all gatherings of more than 150 non-students in school buildings from now until Spring Break, including tonight’s 5th-12th Grade Choir Concert and next week’s Wyoming High School National Honor Society Induction Ceremony and the Wyoming High School Winter Sports Awards. We hope to reschedule all events later in the school year.</p>

<p>We anticipate communicating additional information to all families later today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, three cases of COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) were confirmed in Cuyahoga County in northeast Ohio. Governor DeWine declared a state of emergency, calling the step a legal necessity that allows state departments and agencies to better coordinate in their response. </p>

<p>At this time, the day-to-day activities of Wyoming City Schools are continuing as planned. </p>

<p>We are working closely with the Ohio Department of Health in monitoring the status of the virus and are continuing to follow the guidance from ODH, the Hamilton County Public Health Department (HCPHD), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks, we have taken actions outlined in our emergency plan and are engaged in contingency planning for the possibility of extended school closure should the situation in our state dramatically change in the coming weeks. Currently, teachers and staff are making plans for remote teaching and learning so that if it becomes necessary, we will be prepared. </p>

<p>Should a school closure be necessary, we will give families as much notice as possible.</p>

<p>According to the CDC, the best prevention steps for COVID-19 and any other virus, such as a cold or flu, continue to be:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1.            Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2.            Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Use your upper sleeve if a tissue is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3.            Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">4.            Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">5.            Stay home when you are sick.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.            Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</p>

<p>The health and well-being of our students and staff is always our primary focus and we are committed to communicating with you throughout this health concern. We will send additional updates as the situation develops. Information about COVID-19, details about the district's response and additional resources can be found on the <a href="https://www.wyomingcityschools.org/Content/166" target="_blank">District Updates: COVID-19</a> section of the district website.</p>

<p>As I turn my thoughts to the coming days, I want to assure you that we will continue our measured and thoughtful approach to this situation. Thank you for your engagement, your trust and your patience while we navigate this new terrain.</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br>
Tim Weber<br>
Superintendent<br>

<p><strong>March 4, 2020</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hello Wyoming City Schools families,</p>

<p>There has been a lot of information regarding COVID-19 (or what’s being called the coronavirus) circulating in recent days. While there are no confirmed cases here in Ohio, I want you to know that we are working closely with the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) in monitoring the status of the virus and are following guidance from ODH, the Hamilton County Public Health Department (HCPHD), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>As a district, our emergency planning has several stages to it, including this first step of notification to our families, providing basic information and steps that can be taken to reduce the chances of spreading this most recent virus.  </p>

<p>According to the CDC, the best prevention steps for COVID-19 and any other virus, such as a cold or flu, are to:</p>

<p>1.            Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>

<p>2.            Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Use your upper sleeve if a tissue is not available.</p>

<p>3.            Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>

<p>4.            Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</p>

<p>5.            Stay home when you are sick.</p>

<p>6.            Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</p>

<p>We are reminding our students to be sure they are thoroughly washing their hands. Our cleaning crews are disinfecting high-contact surfaces on a nightly basis and this is also taking place on our buses. At this time, all daily activities are continuing as planned. Due to the changing nature of the situation, we are continuing to monitor all activities on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>This email is not meant to cause undue alarm or fear as the most recent communication from our public health partners is that our risk in Ohio is considered low at this time. We also plan to be sensitive to those students who might be more concerned than others about what they've heard in the news.  Please consider the potential impact of some information on younger children. One option could be to simply remind them that hand washing and keeping their hands away from their face are all a part of healthy habits that will reduce the risk of getting a cold.</p>
