              <h4>Superintendent Letter</h4>
April 14, 2020
				  <p>	</p>
<p>Dear Spartan Parents – </p>
                  <p>On Thursday, April 9, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf extended his order to close Pennsylvania schools through the end of the academic year.  Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera issued a proclamation, under the authority granted under Act 13 of the PA School Code, to close all schools until the threat to health and safety caused by the Pandemic of 2020 has ended. While we have been preparing for this potential outcome for several weeks now, this news is difficult to hear. </p>
                  <p>I want to begin by reassuring our families that our Continuity of Education Plan is designed to enable us to continue teaching and learning through June 3, 2020. Our teachers are prepared and committed to provide the best instruction possible as they implement our distance-learning plan.  We will continue to support our families in every way we can during the challenging weeks and months ahead. </p>
                  <p>With the knowledge that schools are now closed for the duration of the school year, we turn our efforts more fully toward Phase II. These critical matters include considerations for graduation and more purposeful learning for our students.   Please see the <a href="covid/PHASE%20II%20FAQs.pdf">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a> for details. </p>
                  <p>Many parents of students have concerns about what the extended school closure means for their child’s long-term learning.  Please know we have already begun discussions on plans and programs to address lost skills when school resumes, as we know this is a reality for many of our students.  We realize recuperation of skills may take some time and we remain dedicated to working diligently with your child, both now within the confines of distance learning, and within in the future when we are back with your children in our schools.  We are here to work with you toward the common goal of closing any additional gaps that occur in your child’s progress because of these school closures.  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps now more than ever, our attention to the social and emotional well-being of our teachers, students, and other members of our community is extremely important. As we adjust to this new normal, it is important to ask for help when we need it, monitor the emotional health of our children and loved ones, and maintain connections with those who are isolated and in need. Resources are available on our website. </p>
                  <p>Our schools are more than just buildings where students gather to learn. Within our schools, students overcome challenges, learn to make friends, and find their spark. The passion our teachers have for their craft inspires ingenuity, perseverance, and hope. However, over the past few weeks, I am more confident than ever that our students and teachers can and will find new ways to connect and celebrate the joy that comes with learning. School is a beautiful place to be – but the spirit of North Schuylkill Schools is in each of us. </p>
                  <p>We share in the disappointment that our families feel, but we also know that the most important concern we share is for the health and well-being of those we care about. As we manage this crisis together, we take comfort in the knowledge that our community is united in our support for one another and for those most vulnerable. </p>
                  <p>Spartan Pride,<br>
                    Robert J Ackell, Ed.D.<br>
                    Superintendent</p>

<br><p>Hello Spartan Families – </p>
                  <p>First, I apologize for the length of this correspondence. It does contain very important information. Please read carefully. I would like to personally thank you for your ongoing support during these unprecedented times. The COVID-19 outbreak and actions at the local and state level are continually evolving. We will continue to update our Spartan community periodically throughout this situation. At this time we have the following updates to share: </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Announcement of Flexible Learning</font></strong><br>
                    In light of the Pennsylvania Governor Wolf-imposed school shutdown, the North Schuylkill School District maintains a commitment to our mission to provide our students with opportunities designed to meet individual needs and to ensure that every child has experiences that promote growth and excellence in all academic and social development areas. Today, we are fully engaged in such a challenge. The District is going to offer our students the opportunity to engage in Flexible Learning activities while schools remain closed. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Phone call from Homeroom teacher</font></strong> <br>
                    Starting on Monday, March 30 and continuing Tuesday, March 31, homeroom teachers will begin making initial contact with all students and/or parents of Kindergarten through Twelfth Grade. Our goal is to provide updates, present our continuity of education plan, and ask questions regarding technology. Teachers will be calling using a Google Classroom function that may block or provide an out of the area phone number. Please answer your phone on Monday and Tuesday, expecting to receive an unknown number. Numbers could be originated from the Philadelphia or New York areas.</p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Enrichment and Review</font></strong><br>
                    The goal during this extended school closure is to ensure that everyone is successful – students, parents and teachers. Our teachers have planned weekly review and enrichment activities. It is recommended that students spend at the elementary level approximately 30-45 minutes per subject each week. At the high school level, it is recommended that students spend approximately 60 minutes per subject each week. These activities are not meant to replace daily classroom instruction. We are encouraging all students to do their best to complete the assigned material. </p>
                  <p>Teachers are providing technology (Google Classroom) and non-technology (packets) options. We ask that you choose the option that works for you. Your homeroom teacher will be able to provide you with an explanation of these options to guide you through this Flexible Instruction process. Families will be surveyed for Internet access and devices by homeroom teachers. Students who do have Internet access but not a devices will be issued a District Chromebook. </p>
                  <p>Schuylkill Technology Center (STC), Fountain Springs Cyber Academy (FSCA) and Bloomsburg Advance College Experience (ACE) students are expected to receive further clarification regarding their education in the upcoming week. </p>
                  <p><strong><font color="blue">Google Classroom</font></strong><br>
                    Connecting to Google Classroom on your computer, iPad or smartphone will give you a direct connection to your teacher. Your child can log on using their student id number @gapps.northschuylkill.net account. If your child is not able to access Google Classroom, you can contact your child’s teacher via email. Information will be available online on a weekly basis every Friday with the exception of this week which will be on Wednesday, April 1st. All virtual review and enrichment materials/activities will be available for you through Google Classroom. </p>
                  <p><strong><font color="blue">Packet Work</font></strong><br>
                    For student without Internet access distribution of paper handouts will occur bi-weekly on Fridays from 4PM-6PM and the following Monday from 9AM-11AM at the North Schuylkill Elementary School. The first pick up of physical materials will be Friday, April 3rd and Monday, April 6th. To ensure proper social distancing, we ask that you drive up to the curb at the elementary school and pop your trunk. A North Schuylkill staff member will bring the materials to you and place them in your trunk. No one is permitted to enter the school building. Packets will not be returned to teachers.</p>
				  <p><strong><font color="blue">Communication with Teacher</font></strong><br>
                    Your child's classroom teacher is your best resource to help you with the work he/she is being asked to complete. Communication will occur in other platforms including Google, remind, class dojo, email, phone calls, homework blogs, etc. Feedback will be provided on activities. All teachers will be hosting office hours every Tuesday and Thursday from 1PM-3PM in Google Meet to answer questions or provide clarification on any of the material for each week. </p>
				  <p><strong><font color="blue">Special Education</font></strong><br>
                    We understand that there may be unique challenges for students with disabilities and that this may be a stressful time for our families. Throughout the closure, your child’s special education team will work to provide access to the Flexible Learning framework while considering each child’s specific needs. For support, please reach out to your child’s teacher or therapist. You can also contact Special Education Director, Mr. Knute Brayford, <a href="mailto:kbrayford@northschuylkill.net">kbrayford@northschuylkill.net</a> or Assistant Director of Special Education, Mrs. Christine Greblick <a href="mailto:cgreblick@northschuylkill.net">cgreblick@northschuylkill.net</a>. </p>
				  <p><strong><font color="blue">Student Expectations</font></strong> <br></p>
<li> Monitoring Google Classroom daily or work on packet daily</li>
					  <li>Establishing daily routines for engaging in the learning experiences</li>
					  <li>Being responsible for independent learning and maintaining a positive growth mindset</li>
					  <li>Engaging in all learning with academic honesty</li>
					  <li>Being an advocate and communicating with your teachers</li>
					  <li>Complying with School Internet Safety policies including expectations for online etiquette</li>
				  <li>Completing work by Friday at 3:00PM which will serve as evidence of completion</li>
				  <br><strong><font color="blue">State Assessments</font></strong><br><p> All PSSA testing and Keystone exams for the 2019-20 school year have been cancelled by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Additionally, standardized testing for students in career and technical education (STC) programs for the 2019-20 school year have been cancelled. </p>
				  <p>On March 20, The College Board posted some very important information concerning this year's AP Exams. AP Exams will not be conducted face-to-face this year and tests will be adjusted to reflect school closures. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Technology Support</font></strong><br>
				    We will communicate our plans to distribute District issued Chromebooks in the near future, if one is requested. Additionally, we are not able to repair personal devices. If you need assistance with a District issued Chromebook or Google Classroom please view the student help documents and forms located on our District website. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">End of the 3rd Marking Period</font></strong><br>
				    Based on the most recent information from PDE in regards to the additional week closure, paired with the uncertainty of what may lie beyond April 7th, we will close the third marking period. Report cards will be available during the second week of April. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Meals</font></strong><br>
				    We will continue to provide Grab-and-Go Bagged Breakfast and Lunches at three locations throughout the district during the flexible learning days. In the first week we were able to provide 9,360 meals to our students. For more information visit: <a href="https://bit.ly/NSLunches">https://bit.ly/NSLunches </a></p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">School Calendar</font></strong><br>
				    At this point, we have been granted latitude in the mandatory 180 days of school. We will continue to monitor the situation, follow guidelines provided to us by governmental agencies and determine an updated calendar as soon as possible. The last day of school has not been determined at this point. Spring break will be one day, Good Friday, April 10th. Again, we are not sure if and when we will return to normal operations. </p>
					<p><strong><font color="blue">Prom and Graduation</font></strong><br>
				    Personally, of all the many negative things that this closure has caused, I think the most negative affect has been on our 12th graders’ senior year. Please know that we will do everything possible to safe guard these events. In addition, we also realize that some of our seniors have plans shortly after the original date of graduation. Students are going to the armed forces, military academies, and post-secondary education endeavors. We will certainly consider these issues when finalizing schedules and school calendars moving forward. At this time we have been in discussion with Capriottis and are certain the prom will need to be rescheduled to a date in the summer. </p>

              <h4>School Closure Extended</h4> March 23, 2020
				  
              
              <p>Spartan Community -<br><br>
                    “The Department of Education (PDE) announced today that all schools in the commonwealth will remain closed through at least April 6 as a result of the COVID-19 response efforts. The closure order could be extended beyond April 6 if necessary, to save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>
                    Under the new timeline, school buildings would reopen on Tuesday, April 7 for two days to allow school administrators, teachers, and other staff time to prepare classrooms, set up cafeterias, schedule transportation and arrange other business operations. Students would return to school on Thursday, April 9, unless extending the closure is needed in response to the situation with the virus at that time.”<br><br>
                    The North Schuylkill School District will take the time needed to evaluate this decision and provide additional details specific to our school district over the next few days. We are still waiting for further clarification and direction from the state about what “continuity of learning” means and should look like. Please continue to check our web site and Facebook page during this time.<br><br>
                    On a final note, As each day of this pandemic passes, we are confronted with sadness and despair about what was lost or may be in jeopardy of being lost. Aside from worrying about basic needs being met, we worry about what will happen with the end of the marking period, student grades, musicals, spring sports, concerts, field trips, prom, graduation, etc. Your concerns about our ability to offer these, in some instances, once in a lifetime events, is understandable. I wish I had a definitive answer for each one of them, but I do not. However, I will leave you with this. As we continue down this uncharted path, we will do our best to postpone these moments that students looked forward to and worked to achieve and not cancel them. <br><br>
                    Again, I want to thank you for your support this past week and as we move forward.<br><br>
                    Stay healthy and be well,<br>

              <p>North Schuylkill SD Families:</p>
                  <p>We continue to navigate the continued challenges associated with the social distancing that is meant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We would like to provide you with a few reminders and updates.</p>
                  <p>Governor Wolf announced a statewide two-week school district closure and has provided additional guidance to districts regarding our responsibility for the continuity of instruction. We have compiled a list of Frequently Asked Question (FAQs) to assist you. </p>

                  <p>We know that you have many questions now and will have more in the days to come. While some of the more complex questions can’t be answered yet, we have created a page on our website to house resources and frequently asked questions associated with Coronavirus COVID-19. Visit <a href="http://www.northschuylkill.net/">www.northschuylkill.net </a></p>
                  <p>If you have any further questions or comments during this closure, the District set up an email account that will be monitored by multiple administrators.  Email <a href="mailto:concerns@northschuylkill.net">concerns@northschuylkill.net</a></p>
                  <p>Please know, it will take some time to consider what the impact of a prolonged closure will be for North Schuylkill. In addition, we are awaiting additional guidance on more complex matters from the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania such as the 180-school day requirements, state testing and much more.  We continue to be in regular contact with local, state, and federal authorities, as well as our neighboring districts. </p>
                  <p>As a reminder, all NSSD campuses and buildings are closed and secured. The coming weeks will continue to challenge us as a community and as a nation. We have said it many times, but we are deeply grateful for the support of our families and the entire North Schuylkill District community. Please continue to care for one another and reach out to those who are vulnerable. </p>

              <h4>Superintendent's Message on Coronavirus (COVID-19) Closing</h4> March 13, 2020
				  
              
              <p>North Schuylkill SD Families: <br><br>
                    The health, safety and security of our students and staff are our highest priorities. We take very seriously our role in the protection of our most precious people. It is my hope that you believe in our commitment to your child and the well-being of all in our school community.</p>
                  <p>The recent events surrounding the COVID-19, Coronavirus, have made for difficult decisions on the national, state and local level. While there is an abundance of information available, guidance and direction have been limited. With that being the case, we are left with trying to make the best decision possible, in areas that are not part of our expertise. </p>
                  <p>After conferring with state officials, county superintendents and analyzing the best data available at this time, we will institute the following: </p>
                  <p>• Beginning Monday, March 16, 2020, all schools in the North Schuylkill SD will be closed for two weeks. No one is to enter without approval of the Superintendent. <br>
                    • Tentative Reopen date would be March 30, 2020. <br>
                    • At the close of schools today, all students and staff should take home all resources that they may need for instruction. These would include textbooks, workbooks and technology. These items will only be expected to be used if the closure persists longer than the two weeks. <br>
                    • During the two-week break, the buildings will be thoroughly cleaned and then closed. For those essential people who are needed to clean and secure the buildings during that time, extra protocols will be in place to ensure contamination does not occur. <br>
                    • No school events of any kind will occur. They will be postponed when possible or cancelled if that is the only other option. <br>
                    • At this time, the makeup of school days will occur through the utilization of makeup days at the Easter Holiday and days added to the end of the year. This is subject to change should the Department of Education provide relief in some way. If so, our District will seek that relief whether it is in number of required days or hours. </p>
                  <p>During the two-week period, we highly recommend that students do not regularly leave their home, travel or place themselves in situations that promote the transmission of the virus. We ask that everyone follow the rules established for social distancing and the hygiene efforts that have been in place for some time. </p>
                  <p>Please know that this decision does not come without knowledge of the disruption this causes for our students, staff and families. It has not been taken lightly. We recognize the burden this places on families. We are also saddened with the possible opportunities that are lost because of the closure. It is only because of the possible health risks to so many that this decision, while difficult, is being made. None of us wants to be the one whose child is sick or whose grandparent becomes gravely ill. Mitigating the number infected is our main goal. </p>
                  <p>In a best case, the virus begins to fade, effects very few and we return to classes soon. The worst-case scenario has played out across the world. We hope to reduce that likelihood. </p>
                  <p>Sincerely, </p>

Due to the rapidly changing manner in which regional and national organizations are working to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals and factoring in recent updates from local and national governmental and health agencies, North Schuylkill School District has teamed-up with other Schuylkill County Schools and the Schuylkill County Emergency Agency to develop a joint press release and a Schuylkill County Pandemic Action Plan.  <a href="pdf/district/COVID-19%20Press%20Release%203%2012%202020.pdf">Please see attached</a>. </p> 

<p>In the North Schuylkill School District, students and staff will be asked to stay home for a period of 14 days from the time they left an area with widespread or ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).  China, Iran, Italy and South Korea are currently listed on the CDC Level 3 Travel Health Alert –   <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html</a>.
</p>

<p>Closures of schools serve two purposes: (1) to prevent the ready transmission of a disease in a community where that disease is known to be prevalent and (2) to allow for building decontamination or cleaning.  Again, given when the prevalence and duration of a COVID-19 outbreak in any given community is unknown.</p> 

<p>At this time, the North Schuylkill School District’s plan to provide instruction to our students, if we have to close suddenly due to the coronavirus or other emergency, would be the same as a cancellation due to weather.   If the District would close before the scheduled Spring Break (April 9 – April 19), the District would utilize those built in snow make-up days (6 days available).  Good Friday, April 10th, would not be used as a make-up day and would remain a non-school day.  If the District would close after the Spring Break (April 20), the original graduation date of June 3, 2020, will be moved and make-up days will be added to the end of the year. </p> 

<p>At this time, there has been a small number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Pennsylvania. As a school district, we will continue to closely monitor the situation and take guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>Remember, we all play a role in reducing the likelihood of a coronavirus outbreak in our school district community. We encourage everyone to practice good habits, including:</p>
● Wash your hands regularly, especially after using the restroom and before preparing or consuming food. Using soap and hot water, wash for about 20 seconds. Be sure to also wash your fingertips.<br>
● Avoid coughing or sneezing into your hands or in the air. Always try to cough or sneeze into a tissue, and then throw the tissue away. If you don’t have a tissue, cough/sneeze into your arm. <br>
● As much as you can, avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.<br> 
● If children are feeling sick, please keep them home from school. Allow them some time to feel better so that they do not risk infecting others. <br><p>As we continue to engage in planning and discussion around the impact of coronavirus, both in and around our community, please remember that the virus is unpredictable causing a very dynamic and constantly changing response.</p>

              <p>In the last few weeks, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, has become a topic of concern nationwide. Although the virus is not widespread in Pennsylvania at this time, that status could change. Being proactive is key to prevention and mitigation. </p>
              <p>Please see attached Preventive Measures Memo and CDC Fact Sheet. </p>
