<p>Dear BCS Families,</p>
<p>This week brought beautiful weather, so hopefully, your children enjoyed their (digital) recess and P.E. outside. Below I wanted to recap where to find links to important information.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Learning</strong></p>
<p>As we continue to use our digital learning platforms to engage and educate our students, we know there will be questions to arise. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to your child’s teacher with any questions or concerns you may have.</p>

<p>Everywhere we turn the expression “we’re in this together” is being used. Even I have used it. Recently, I was thinking about the fact that Buford has always been “in it together”. In the last five weeks as needs have arisen there has been an abundance of volunteers wanting to step up. I am extremely proud to be a part of this community, to be in the trenches each day with an amazing faculty striving to give our students their best. To be successfully following the social-distancing guidelines, I don’t feel distant from our students. Their needs are our guiding light each day as we trudge through difficult decisions and seek ways to mitigate their losses. Thank you, Buford, for being not just a community but a family.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Downs, Superintendent</p>

<div> </div>
<div>Dear BCS families,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Though I know Spring Break didn’t look the way many had planned, I hope you were able to find ways to disconnect and are ready to finish out the last quarter of the school year the best we can. This week we will begin to wade through the many loose ends that were left after the abrupt end to our in-person instruction. As soon as we have answers to these questions, we will communicate those details with you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Digital Learning resumes tomorrow (Monday, April 13). I’m continually impressed with the creative ways our staff reaches out to their students. They extend past teaching curriculum and find avenues to lift the spirits of our children during this time of uncertainty. It reminds me of how amazing our Buford family truly is!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know that one of your main questions is about how we will grade and assess your student during the closure. This has been the topic of many discussions among principals and central office staff. The simple answer is that grades earned throughout the closure will not negatively affect your student’s overall grade; student work submitted during this time will only be allowed to add value to the overall numeric grade. Now that I’ve shared this information, I have an important and heartfelt request: please stay committed to digital learning. Our teachers are dedicating time and energy into providing learning experiences and educational opportunities; please continue to honor their time and effort. Your students have worked hard and achieved so much throughout this academic year, before and during the closure; please encourage and support them for the remainder of the school year. Additionally, it is important to remember that your child’s time, effort, and learning this spring will impact their preparedness for their class and grade level next school year. Put simply, for all the above reasons, the learning we achieve from now until May matters.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Meal delivery will continue through the end of our regular school year. Each week the number of meals we distribute is climbing. We know that children cannot learn if they are hungry, so I applaud the work of our staff who are working together to make sure these needs are met. You can find the details of the meal distribution stops on our website or the attached flyer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our Buford community was strong before the school closure and I have no doubt, with each day and each step forward, we will be stronger tomorrow.</div>
<div>
<br>Sincerely,</div>
<div>Dr. Downs, Superintendent</div>

<div>Dear BCS Families,</div>
<div>
<br>The call has been made that we all were dreading. We know it’s in the best interest of our community’s health to close our school doors for the remainder of the year, but that doesn’t make it easier to look into the eyes of our students and staff and see their anguish.</div>
<div>
<br>Last night, as I was processing the magnitude of this announcement and the decisions that lie ahead, my thoughts continually went to our seniors. We want to celebrate them and all they have contributed to our schools. My hope is to give them the graduation they deserve. Due to the fact that the Buford Arena is our facility, it gives us leeway in that planning, but until Governor Kemp clears the current restrictions, we just are not able to plan for that.</div>
<div>
<br>I know that you have many questions regarding what the next steps will be, for example:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>When will your student be able to clean out their desks/lockers?</em></div>
<div><em>How will your student return their library books?</em></div>
<div><em>How will my student get the yearbook we ordered?</em></div>
<div><em>Will you get a refund for field trips?</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our administrative team is working with the staff to discover what these concerns might be as well as possible solutions. As long as we are under “shelter-in-place” orders we cannot enter the schools, but after Spring Break we will begin tackling how to address these questions once the restrictions are lifted.</div>
<div>
<br><strong>Digital Learning Continuation</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For teachers Digital Learning presents some new and novel challenges; however, being a distance-learning student is also very different. Consider your child’s new reality. Gone is the closeness of friends, of easily getting together for group projects, study sessions, conversations, and discussions. Gone is their ability to meet with teachers after class for extra help, or to ask a follow-up question. Everything now is being mediated by a computer screen. Students may or may not function well in an online environment so being prepared around some of their challenges is important. Additionally, when not in school, some students may be tempted to do other things than schoolwork, so managing student motivation and attendance can become an issue—it is easy to fall behind distance learning. In this unique learning situation, we encourage families to set up structures where children can show off the work they have been engaged in.</div>

<br><strong>No Hungry Kid</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are proud to have delivered 21,138 meals to children in our community! I appreciate everyone who works to make this endeavor not just possible, but successful. Most don’t see the countless hours behind-the-scenes where Megan Gower, Director of School Nutrition, and Brooke Higgins, School Nutrition Coordinator, do all that is necessary to make these deliveries come to fruition. Our students are blessed by their continued efforts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our School Nutrition Department will continue our meal delivery service on Monday, April 13. Meals will be delivered on Mondays and Wednesdays.</div>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="color: #009639; font-size: 14pt">Grading during Digital Learning Update (grades 1-8) – March 30, 2020</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Buford City Schools will implement a new grading system for the remainder of school closure (through April 27) for grades 1-8. The goal of this new grading system is to provide low impact grades for all students while providing additional support for those students who have not yet mastered standards in the four content areas.  Teachers have already provided face-to-face instruction over the majority of the grade level standards. Yearly averages should not be negatively impacted. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Students who were passing courses as of March 13 for yearly average will receive a weekly participation grade (100) if they submit all of their work for the week.  Participation Grades will be included in final grade calculations but will be low impact grades and will not significantly increase or decrease a student’s averages. As of March 13, all students will have three grades to date, Week 1 Participation, Week 2 Participation, and Week 3 Participation. (Note: 1st and 2nd Grade student Participation grades began with Week 2) Grades taken between March 16-present will remain in the gradebook but will not impact final average as noted by the asterisk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students who were failing any of the four content area courses (ELA, math, science, and social studies) as of March 13 for the yearly average, will continue to receive Participation grades and additional support and grades in the area he/she was failing until the student is passing the course. </p>
<p dir="ltr">3rd Quarter Middle School Connections classes will be converted to Semester 2 classes in Power School and teachers will continue to give a weekly participation grade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We appreciate your patience as we all work together to navigate the digital learning process and find a healthy balance to continue learning. If you have questions about a particular class, please reach out to your child’s teacher.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #008500"><strong>COVID-19 Update – March 24, 2020</strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Aggressive efforts to halt the spread of COVID-19 in our community continue as Buford City Schools (BCS) is underway with our second full week of Digital Learning Days. Last week, we rose to the challenge and used our creativity and technology to connect in virtual spaces to continue the teaching and learning in our District. Additionally, BCS staff and volunteers eagerly greeted many of you at our 10 BCS food distribution sites around our District.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Instructional Support for Distance Learning</strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Digital Learning is well underway, and BCS students and teachers are adjusting to the new reality of these methods. Within this new reality, you may see your student talking with their teacher and other students through our Google Meet platform, participating in live teacher-led lessons, and reading a host of online books through MyON reading.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To give our faculty time to plan accordingly, we have begun a rotation of Teacher Planning Days for our teachers. These days will allow them to have virtual department and faculty meetings, as well as time for planning their Digital Learning curriculum and complete grading. For students, this will allow them a day to catch up on their work or to enjoy reading a book or some (social-distancing) time outside.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The schedule for the Teacher Planning Days during Digital Learning Days are as follows: BES – Monday, BA – Tuesday, BSA – Wednesday, BMS – Thursday, BHS – Friday</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>School Closure - When Will This End?</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I realize this is the most obvious question I need to address. At this point, the honest answer is: I truly don’t know. I acknowledge that other school districts may be projecting a specific return date. In the absence of any clear guidance from state and national officials, I do not feel comfortable guessing when our school doors will open. It has been stated it is highly likely the number of coronavirus cases will continue to increase in the coming weeks. As such, a return to school would be even more unlikely as we are directed, per our community mitigation strategy, to further social distance and self-quarantine. With all that said, I don’t know when we will return to school; but I promise to over-communicate with you as I know more information.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Closure Dates, Spring Events, Community Meetings, and Graduation</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We’ve previously shared that Gov. Kemp closed schools through March 31, 2020. Given recent guidance from health officials and governmental actions from various elected officials, the decision has been made that BCS will continue Digital Learning through April 3, with Spring Break following April 6-10. I want to share this information with you now to allow you as much time as possible to prepare for this length of the closure.</div>
<div>During our closure, all previously planned community meetings and events have been canceled. We are evaluating future events on a case-by-case basis and will make decisions in the near future. To the Class of 2020, while we cannot offer any definitive words on what the rest of this school year and graduation will look like, please know that we are cognizant of the importance these senior year events hold. I’m going to take everything one day at a time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style="color: #000000"><strong>State Suspension of Assessments, Evaluations</strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>State School Superintendent Richard Woods on Monday, March 16, announced the suspension of state assessments, including the Georgia Milestones, as well as attendance accountability measures until further notice. Mr. Woods said school leaders need to be focused on the safety of students and staff and on creating flexible ways to keep virtual learning going. That is exactly what we are doing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style="color: #000000"><strong>No Kid Hungry</strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are proud to have delivered 4,664 meals to BCS students this week. Each day, across 10 stops in our community, we have been delivering a healthy breakfast and lunch. I am eternally grateful for the school nutrition staff, bus drivers, and volunteers who selflessly (and safely) make sure that no kid in Buford goes hungry. For the well-being of our students and staff, please know we are following strict health guidelines in food preparation and delivery; we will continue to do the same going forward as we seek to meet our moral and social responsibility to feed children.</div>
<div>To reduce the health risk to our staff and our families, we are changing our delivery times. On Thursday (March 26, 2020), we will deliver meals for Thursday and Friday, which will include 2 breakfasts and two lunches. Next week, we be delivering meals on Monday (March 30, 2020) and Wednesday (April 1, 2020). On Monday, there will be 2 breakfasts and 2 lunches, and on Wednesday, there will be 3 breakfasts and 3 lunches. This plan will require a little more preparation, so the delivery times have been pushed back by 30 minutes. You can find all the details on the meal delivery flyer. We will not be delivering meals during Spring Break (April 6-10, 2020).</div>
<div>Meals are available to children 18 years old or younger, or 22 years old or younger for those with special needs. Children must be present to receive the meal and be counted for required state and federal recordkeeping. Families are encouraged to pull up with their children in a drive-thru style for service and should remain in their vehicle while receiving their food. Walk-ups are welcome.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Weekly Groceries Available</strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The North Gwinnett Cooperative is providing families with shelf-stable groceries for the week. For full details, you can click here.</div>
<ul>
<li>Hours for services will change to: Monday 4pm-8pm / Wednesday, Thursday &amp; Friday 10am-2pm / Saturday Noon-2pm</li>
<li>Hours for donations will change to: Monday Noon-8pm / Wed-Sat 10am-4pm. (See a list of current needs here.)</li>
</ul>
<div>These groceries are in addition to our emergency meal distribution and bus delivery of food, which we began last week.<br>In closing, I thank each of you for your persistence, patience, and understanding. Now more than ever, I am grateful for how each of you continues to support our BCS children and community. Please continue to over-communicate with school staff or me as you have specific needs – we are all here for your success.</div>

<div>The first two days of meal delivery have gone great. Our CO and administrative staff have enjoyed seeing the students at the different delivery sites. We know that these times bring different challenges for every family. Whether there its food-instability, empty grocery stores shelves, or a need to see a smiling BCS staffer, please know that everyone is welcome to these meals. All youth 18 years and younger may receive bagged-meals each weekday. You can click <a href="https://4.files.edl.io/0a19/03/18/20/233952-a5e4c1ab-f7b6-4c13-a8a4-716fd3babf03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> for more information.</div>

<p><strong>Meal Delivery</strong></p>
<p>When we received Governor Kemp’s recommendation to close, our most immediate concern was how quickly we could begin feeding our students who would no longer have access to the healthy meals provided through our School Nutrition Program. I am happy to share that thanks to the quick work of our staff, we received approval from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Georgia Department of Education (GaDOE) to begin feeding students on Tuesday, March 17.</p>
<p>Please know that many thoughtful discussions led to our Meal Delivery Plan, with the well-being and needs of our students as the main focus. I am proud to share that each weekday until schools are back in session, we will be providing a healthy breakfast and lunch to youth that is 18 years old and younger. These meals are available regardless of Free and Reduced Lunch status.</p>
<p>In the hopes of decreasing the burden on families, we are deploying our school buses as mobile delivery units. Each weekday, our bus drivers will load up their bus with meals and stop at 9 sites across our district. We have a team of dedicated drivers and school nutrition professionals who will work diligently to ensure that our students receive a healthy meal. All food preparation and delivery are being conducted in accordance with the Department of Public Health guidelines.</p>
<p>At this time, our meal delivery to students is being run by our staff but should that change and we need volunteers we will reach out to our BCS family.</p>

<p>In discussions regarding school closures due to COVID-19, one of our immediate concerns is making sure our students stay fed. Our School Nutrition and Transportation Departments have developed a plan to deliver breakfast and lunch to our students at specific stops throughout our district. As we focus on the safety and well-being of our students, providing a healthy meal is a top priority.</p>
<p>If you have a Buford City Schools student in grades PreK-12 (18 years old and younger) in need of a healthy breakfast and lunch during our school closure, please refer to the BCS Meal Delivery Site List below. Please note that you are welcome at any of our distribution sites, regardless of your specific school or home location.</p>
<p>A healthy breakfast and lunch will be delivered at the times listed for each location every day, starting Tuesday, March 17, and continuing until school is back in session. Student must be present to receive meals.</p>

<p><span style="color: #008500; font-size: 14pt"><strong>COVID-19 Update – March 12, 2020</strong></span></p>
<p>In light of the most recent announcements from Governor Brian Kemp, and consultation with our neighboring school districts and the Georgia Department of Education, Buford City Schools will be closed beginning on Monday, March 16, 2020. The district will monitor closely and assess the situation to determine if this closure should be extended past this week. When a date to re-open is determined we will let you know immediately. This decision comes as a result of thoughtful discussions regarding what is best for our students, staff, and families. Schools and offices will be open for our scheduled early release day, tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020, as we prepare for this closure. </p>
<p>Additionally, all athletic practices and competitions will be canceled beginning Saturday, March 14, 2020, and will resume when school is back in session. </p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate this unprecedented situation for our district and community. As we have continued to communicate, this is ever-changing and we may need to extend this closure accordingly. We are committed to providing you with information and updates throughout the closure. Look for additional correspondence from me within the near future regarding how we intend to support our students during this closure.</p>

<p>Buford City Schools (BCS) is continuing to closely monitor influenza and coronavirus (now named COVID-19) with the professional guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and our local Gwinnett County Health Department. These are the agencies whose directives we follow about the prevention of disease, injury and disability; promotion of health and well-being; and preparation for and response to emergencies from a health perspective.</p>

<p>You can use these tips to help prevent the spread of flu, the coronavirus, and other illness:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep children who are sick at home. Don’t send them to school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cough/sneeze into your elbow or cover your cough/sneeze with a tissue; throw the tissue away; wash your hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The most up-to-date and reliable information about COVID-19 can be found on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC website</a>, and according to the CDC, the risk to the U.S. public is low at this time. However, the coronavirus has impacted travel for several countries. If your family has upcoming international travel plans, we encourage you to visit <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link </a>for the most current travel advisories.</p>
<p>In BCS, our standard practices during cold and flu season are to use diligent cleaning processes and to monitor student absences. Recently, we have increased and enhanced our custodial procedures. Each day in our schools, frequently used/shared surfaces and items such as door knobs, desks, and computer keyboards will be cleaned, and each classroom and school bus will be supplied with a spray bottle of cleaner that can be used as needed for cleaning. Additionally, we will use foggers in our schools and buses to disinfect those areas not easily cleaned by hand. Please be assured that all cleaning products are safe and approved for schools and do not leave a residue after use. Our administration continues to track student health data and absenteeism on a regular basis so that we can identify the health patterns of our students and staff. We have encouraged school staff to be diligent in referring students to the school nurse if they show fever or flu-like symptoms.</p>
