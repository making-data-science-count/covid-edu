<p>Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,</p>

<p><strong>Continuity of Instruction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We value and thank all of our staff for the commitment, dedication, teamwork, creativity and flexibility in preparing for this transition, developing protocols for continued learning, and designing lessons that ensure continuity of instruction. This work will continue this week.</li>
	<li>You can expect further communication from your childâs building principal as to how teachers will communicate with students during the extended closure.Â </li>
	<li>Our special education teachers and related service providers will be working collaboratively with your childâs teachers to design instruction to meet their individual education programs (IEPs).

</ul>
<p><strong>Student Attendance:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All ESM Schools will be in session Monday, March 16, 2020 through 4PM, March 20, 2020.</li>

<br>
Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,
<p>As previously shared,Â County Executive Ryan McMahonÂ has declared a State of Emergency in Onondaga County and ordered Friday, March 20, 2020 at 4PM as the last day forÂ students attending school until Tuesday, April 14, 2020. As per the order of the County Executive Order students will be out of school beginning Monday, March 23, 2020. Students are scheduled to return on Tuesday, April 14th.</p>

<p>The County Executive noted during theÂ March 14 Press Conference and has communicated today, March 15, that as of this date there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Onondaga County. Based on this data from the Onondaga County Health Department the decision to have school remain in session for students this week will provide time to prepare for child supervision, distance learning connectivity, analysis of accessibility to learning platforms and tools for an extended period of time, preparation for the continuation of the Child Nutrition Program for students qualifying for free/reduced meals, and the communication needed to accomplish all of the aforementioned.Â </p>

<p>All parents should have received a survey via SchoolMessenger today to provide the information needed for each student to have access to a chromebook and connectivity to the internet. This will assist each school in preparing for an online/distance continuity of learning.</p>

<p>Preparation to continue the Child Nutrition Program for students qualifying for free/reduced meals between March 23, 2020 and April 13, 2020 are underway and additional information will be provided this coming week.</p>

<p>Principals will be sending more detailed information in the next few days as the plan to transition to remote learning is more fully developed.Â </p>

<p>We value and appreciate your ongoing support and remain confident in thoughtfully designing and delivering this new framework for learning.Â <br>

<p>Dear Parents/Guardians:<br><br>
The Superintendents ofÂ  all Onondaga County School Districts met with County Executive Ryan McMahon and County Health Commissioner Dr. Gupta earlier today to discuss COVID-19 and the potential impact on this region. As you may be aware the County Executive declared a State of Emergency in Onondaga County.

<p>As per the order of the County Executive students will be out of school beginning Monday, March 23, 2020. Students are scheduled to return on Tuesday, April 14th.</p>

<p>Our District will begin to to share more information regarding this announcement tomorrow and throughout the coming week.</p>

<p>As we prepare for continuity of learning/instruction for all of our students we anticipate using the upcoming week to<br>
solidify plans to meet the needs of our students. We understand that as parents you will be making the best decision for your child/children regarding their attendance during this upcoming week.</p>

<p>As questions arise, please contact your child's teacher or principal during the upcoming week.Â </p>

<p>Thank you for your supportÂ as weÂ navigate this unchartered territory together.Â Â </p>

<h5><span id="docs-internal-guid-b3e4870b-7fff-a944-aee4-68bddfe6dcfa">Letter from ESM to Parents/Guardians (sent via SchoolMessenger 3-13-20)</span></h5>
<br>
Dear ESM Parents/Guardians:<br><br>
As you know, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to be rapidly evolving.Â The health and safety of our students and staff continue to be our highest priority. The intent of this communication is to provide you with an update on the actions we are taking as a District to address growing concerns surrounding the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.<br><br>
ESM is continuing to follow recommendations provided by the Centers for Disease Control, the New York State Department of Health and the Onondaga County Health Department.Â All three organizations are monitoring the situation closely and will provide us with updates as the situation warrants.Â The District has ongoing communication with our Medical Director and the guidance of the Onondaga County Health Department regarding COVID-19 updates. ESM School nurses and our Nurse Supervisor attended a special training offered by Onondaga County this week.Â  Â <br><br>
The New York State Education Department has issued guidance for closing school in the event there is a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a school. If the Onondaga County Health Department confirms a case of COVID-19 in a District school, that building will initially be closed for a minimum of 24-hours for cleaning and disinfecting, as well as, to determine the next steps. As a District, we need to plan and prepare for online or distance learning at all levels. We have engaged a District level team and will be engaging a team at each building to facilitate analyzing the capabilities, strategies, tools and systems in designing a delivery for online or distance learning in the event we need to close school for an extended period of time. We value the knowledge, experience and expertise of our ESM team in addressing this challenge.<br><br>
Families should plan for the possibility of a school closing for 24 hours or an extended period of time. Please plan for the necessary arrangements for childcare in the event buildings are required to close on short notice.<br><br>
As a District, our Facilities Department utilizes extensive cleaning measures to combat the spread of cold and flu-like viruses in our buildings and on all buses.Â In light of concerns regarding COVID-19, our custodians are disinfecting all classrooms and door hardware on aÂ <em>daily</em>Â basis. This is achieved by spraying horizontal surfaces and door knobs/latches/pulls with the appropriate disinfectant and wiping them with a cloth.Â We have also purchased extra alcohol-based hand sanitizers for our buildings to mitigate the spread of respiratory viruses.Â <br><br>
We are presently reviewing all Building and District events to determine on a case-by-case basis what may need to be rescheduled, postponed or cancelled depending on varying factors and circumstances. You will receive notification via SchoolMessenger. The ESM website is being updated on a regular basis.<br><br>
Thank you for your ongoing support as we continue to keep pace with the hourly updates and monitor the impact of the coronavirus in keeping our school community safe and healthy amid this global challenge.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br><br>
Dr. Donna J. DeSiato<br>
Superintendent<br>

<br><span>Dear Parents and Guardians:<br><br>
As you may know, New York State recently confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus 19 (2019-n-CoV) in New York City. Â A second case has been confirmed in Westchester County. This letter is to inform you of the Districtâs response to this emerging health concern.<br><br>
The East Syracuse Minoa Central School District will continue to follow recommendations provided by the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the New York State Department of Health. Â All three organizations are monitoring the situation closely and will provide us with updates as the situation warrants.<br><br>
In addition, Onondaga-Cortland-Madison BOCES and area superintendents have been working together on a safety plan to address the situation as it continues to evolve.<br><br>
The District currently has extensive cleaning measures in place to combat the spread of cold and flu-like viruses. Â These measures have been quite effective in preventing the spread of illness outbreaks in our buildings and on our buses, and we will continue to review and follow these procedures in the months ahead.<br><br>
As a reminder, we are still in the midst of our regular cold and flu season, and it is important that we continue to follow recommendations to minimize the spread of all respiratory viruses, including 2019-n-CoV. Â Please make sure you share the following reminders from the NYS Department of Health with your children and family members:</span>

<ul>
<li><span>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Â Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</span></li>
	<li><span>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</span></li>
	<li><span>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</span></li>
	<li><span>Stay home when you are sick.</span></li>
	<li><span>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. Â If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash.</span></li>
	<li><span>Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Thank you for your continued support of our School District.<br><br>

<br><span id="docs-internal-guid-b3e4870b-7fff-a944-aee4-68bddfe6dcfa">Dear Parent/Guardian,</span><br><br><span id="docs-internal-guid-b3e4870b-7fff-a944-aee4-68bddfe6dcfa">A new coronavirus called 2019 Novel (new) Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This virus had not been found in humans before. This coronavirus can lead to fever, cough and trouble breathing or shortness of breath. There are thousands of diagnosed cases in China and new cases being diagnosed in a number of countries including the United States.</span><br><br><span style="color:#000080;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b3e4870b-7fff-a944-aee4-68bddfe6dcfa"><strong>What do we know?</strong> </span></span>Since this virus is very new, health authorities continue to carefully watch how this virus spreads. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working hard to learn as much as possible about this new virus, so that we can better understand how it spreads and causes illness. The CDC considers this virus to be a serious public health concern. Based on current information the CDC recommends avoiding travel to China. Updated travel information related to 2019?nCoV can be found at <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china</a>Â <br><br><span style="color:#000080;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b3e4870b-7fff-a944-aee4-68bddfe6dcfa"><strong>How Does 2019 Novel (New) Coronavirus Spread?</strong> </span></span>Health experts believe the virus probably spreads from animals to humans and from person to person. Itâs not clear yet how easily the virus spreads from person-to-person. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not currently a concern for the general public and is not actively circulating among New Yorkers at this time. Therefore, there is no need to cancel school or social events, and there is no need for students or school staff to wear surgical masks at school.<br><br><span style="color:#000080;"><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-b3e4870b-7fff-a944-aee4-68bddfe6dcfa">Prevention: </span></strong></span>There are currently no vaccines available to protect against this virus. The New York State Department of Health (DOH) recommends the following ways to minimize the spread of all respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV:
