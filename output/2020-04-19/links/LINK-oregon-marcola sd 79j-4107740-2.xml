			<p>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</p>
<p>Marcola School District and TNW are moving forward with allowing students the choice of earning a Pass/Incomplete grade or a letter grade at the end of the year: (Please know this looks different for elementary students – see below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will still be required to demonstrate proficiency on assignments, projects and assessments.</li>
<li>Students will be required to check in with teachers at least twice per week.</li>
<li>Students who do not follow through with expectations for end of year grades will earn an incomplete and will have an additional 30 days beyond the last day of school to complete necessary assignments, projects and assessments.</li>
<li>Students failing to do so will have their incomplete changed to a no credit and the no credit will be reflected on their report cards.</li>
<li>Elementary students will have the same expectations as above for us to measure their level of performance in core content areas (reading, writing, math, science and social studies) at the end of the year.</li>
<li>We are not looking at credits for elementary, we are looking at academic growth and performance for appropriate supports at the beginning of the 20-21 school year.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do have staff assigned to work directly with students who are experiencing challenges beyond their control and need extra assistance and accommodations to meet end of year expectations.</p>
<p>During these unprecedented and challenging times, it is very important that all students are on a daily routine for their physical, intellectual, emotional and social health.  Teachers are trying to provide daily routines for students to be successful, while realizing the amount of school work required may need to be adjusted based on the needs of each individual student.   It is very important that all students stay on a daily routine with a goal of passing all their classes this last semester.</p>
<p>Please expect a call from your child’s teacher if your child is at risk of earning an incomplete for their end of year grade.  Thank you for your partnership and cooperation to help your child to stay on a healthy routine with a focus of earning passing grades at the end of the year.  We all have to work together to support our most important resource – youth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bill Watkins<br>
Superintendent</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This update is focused on our High School Seniors.  Marcola School District is focusing on the individual needs of each student.  We understand that the closure of school during the last quarter of their K-12 education has been devastating in so many ways.  We also understand that students and families are experiencing personal challenges during these unprecedented times. The last quarter of a Senior’s K-12 education is less than 2% of the time they have spent in schools and classrooms preparing for their future beyond high school.  Seniors who were passing all their classes at the end of the 3rd quarter will not be required to learn new content and will receive the grade they were earning when schools closed. Students who want to improve their grade will work with their classroom teachers to do so. All teachers will provide students opportunities to review and learn at deeper levels the content that has already been taught with a focus on career guidance for plans beyond high school.  We do expect all Seniors to complete their senior projects and present to their advisor/teachers a minimum of three career paths. We will continue to work with each individual student to support their efforts to graduate and pursue their career plans beyond high school. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay Home, Save Lives” order by Governor Brown will continue through the remainder of the school year.  Students and Staff will not be returning to schools this school year. Marcola School District moved to Distance Learning the week before Spring Break and we have conducted school virtually ever since.   Please know, we do expect our students to stay connected with their teacher and continue to learn each and every day with support from our staff. Please contact the school at 541-933-2512 if you have questions, suggestions, needs or you have been unable to connect with their teacher(s).   It is our goal to help all our students continue their education. </span></p>
<p><strong>Recommended maximum daily guidelines for Teacher – Led Learning during Distance Learning For All:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grades K-1 – 45 minutes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grades 2-3 – 60 minutes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grades 4-5 – 90 minutes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grades 6-12 – 20-30 minutes per teacher, no more than 3 hours per day.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please know the daily guidelines are only suggestions for direct instruction in front of a digital device.  Remember that Learning can take place from anywhere at any time and learning should always be the constant with time being the variable.  Teachers are trying to provide projects and activities that don’t always require a student to be in front of a computer. As students spend time on a project or activity – they can always take pictures and videos and forward them on to their teacher(s). </span></p>
<p><b>Graduation and Credits?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have received clarification on Graduation Requirements.  All Seniors will still need 24 credits to graduate, however we are not adding much new information, instead we are reviewing the Learning Targets we have covered and using this last quarter to dig down a little deeper and build projects and activities around past learning targets. The modification of instruction described for seniors is true for all other grades.  We have a team of teachers and educational assistants who are connecting with all Seniors (particularly those who were at risk of graduating) to make sure they have the necessary resources to finish their Senior year and graduate.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcola School District is putting solutions in place for families who have either a poor connection to the internet, or no internet at all.  Please contact the school district at 541-933-2512 if you need assistance with technology.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Monitoring Technology and Virtual Communication:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers are using google classroom and google meet as a Learning Management System (LMS) to deliver instruction and receive feedback from students.  Please know google meet does have a chat feature and we do monitor all conversations – if it’s inappropriate we can block the student from using the chat feature.  Our monitoring system (Securly) also tracks any comments that may indicate a student is not safe.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Digital Citizenship: (We will hold students responsible for following our Digital Citizenship Standards.)</strong></p>
<p>As we continue to provide a distance learning education to our students, which in most cases require the use of digital learning tools, we require our students to follow the Digital Citizenship Responsibilities for success : (See Below)</p>
<ol>
<li>I can recognize the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of living, learning, and working in an interconnected digital world and can act in ways that are safe, legal and ethical.</li>
<li>I demonstrate and advocate for positive, safe, legal and ethical habits when using technology and when interacting with others online</li>
<li>I manage my digital identities and reputations within school policy, including demonstrating and understanding of how digital actions are never erasable.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Food Service: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are continuing to offer pick up and delivery of food to our families every Monday and Wednesday from 4:00 to 6:00 pm.  Huge thanks to our staff who have agreed to assist with food service – you’re amazing.

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p class="p1">March 29, 2020</p>
<p class="p1">Our community, our state, and much of the world are now dealing with an unprecedented public health crisis. We hope that you and your family are safe and healthy.</p>
<p class="p1">Public schools are part of the essential social fabric and economy of our communities. We know that the current school closure has caused difficulties for many families who rely on their schools for meals, health care, and a safe place to be during the day. It has also caused concern for school employees and their families. We want you to reassure you, per Governor Brown’s Executive Order 20-08, that all school employees will be paid and no one will lose their job because they are sick or because it would put their health, or the health of someone they live with, at risk to work.</p>
<p class="p1">We want to thank all of our members and educators. Thank you all for your dedication to our children, families, and to each other. Thank you for your patience as we deal with this crisis and the unimaginable impacts on our schools and students. Thank you for your understanding as we try to answer your questions and meet the challenges each day brings. We know that your communities are looking to you for answers and guidance and you have been asked to provide stability in a time of confusion, fear, and uncertainty.</p>
<p class="p1">Our organizations believe it is critical for our members to prioritize the tasks the Governor has asked us to complete and work together to ensure that your health and safety, and the health and safety of the students we serve, are at the forefront. We are asking you to show each other patience, grace and understanding as we work through all of the unknown challenges on the horizon. Our communities need clear and consistent information from teachers, educators, classified staff, administrators, and school board members to help reassure them that we are doing everything we can for their children.</p>
<p class="p1">With that in mind we want to share with you our recommendations for a set of guiding principles for collaboration and cooperation during these unheard-of circumstances:</p>
<p class="p1">1. School districts, charter schools, and ESDs have been directed to meet the requirements of the governor’s executive orders, and those requirements include tasks that require staff to be present in buildings. This may mean staff will be asked to complete work assignments outside of their normal duties, consistent with the governor’s executive order (e.g. a principal asked to deliver meals, a teacher asked to provide childcare). School districts should:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Facilitate telework and work-from-home for employees, as appropriate</li>
<li class="p1">Limit staff-to-staff and staff-to-student contact to that required to fulfill the governor’s executive order</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">2. Employees who disclose that they are at high risk, or live with someone who is at high risk, should not be asked to provide medical verification or a doctor’s note at this time. Now is not the time to place additional strain or burden on our medical professionals, but staff may be accountable if they provide false information.</p>
<p class="p1">3. Each district should establish a clear and consistent district-wide protocol for employees to disclose that they are at high-risk or live with someone who is at high-risk. The specifics of that disclosure should be confidential.</p>
<p class="p1">4. District employees who fall into a high-risk category, or who live with an individual in a highrisk category, should not be required to physically report to work. They are required to telework or provide out-of-office services as worked out by the district. High-risk, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Oregon Health Authority (OHA), means anyone meeting any of the following criteria:</p>
<p class="p1">a. Aged 60+</p>
<p class="p1">b. Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen</p>
<p class="p1">c. Compromised immune system (immunosuppression) (e.g., seeing a doctor for cancer and treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation, receiving an organ or bone marrow transplant, taking high doses of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant medications, HIV with a CD4 count &lt;200)</p>
<p class="p1">d. Blood disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease or on blood thinners)</p>
<p class="p1">e. Chronic kidney disease</p>
<p class="p1">f. Chronic liver disease</p>
<p class="p1">g. Current or recent pregnancy (in the last two weeks)</p>
<p class="p1">h. Diabetes, or other endocrine disorders</p>
<p class="p1">i. Metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders)</p>
<p class="p1">j. Heart disease (such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease)</p>
<p class="p1">k. Neurological and neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions</p>
<p class="p1">5. Consistent with CDC and OHA guidelines, employees who are sick or who are exhibiting flulike symptoms should not physically report to work.</p>
<p class="p1">6. Staff who are asked to report to work and do not fall into a high-risk category or do not live with someone in a high-risk category should report. If they cannot or will not physically report, for another reason, they should use appropriate leave for the hours they are not working in order to receive their regular pay.</p>
<p class="p1">7. When district employees are required to physically report to work, social distancing guidelines should be followed as closely as possible, with minimal exceptions being made to fulfill essential services. That includes maintaining at least six feet of distance between individuals to the extent possible, while still providing essential services required by the governor’s executive order. Employees called back to work should be working in a sanitized environment. Given the inability to follow full distancing recommendations in all situations, such as childcare settings, employees should follow CDC, OHA and Early Learning Division guidance.</p>
<p class="p1">8. District employees who have children who are unable to care for themselves at home and who do not have childcare due to COVID-19 closures, may take advantage of childcare provided by the district or community-based childcare providers, if it is available. Otherwise, these district employees should not be required to physically report to work, but they are subject to telework and other out-of-office services as worked out with the district. A school employee will not be required to bring their child to work.</p>
<p class="p1">9. If employees feel they are in imminent danger or being asked to work in unsafe conditions, those concerns should be immediately reported to the staff member required to monitor and enforce social distancing requirements per guidance from ODE, or to their staff supervisor.</p>
<p class="p1">10. No school employee should suffer a loss in pay during the school closure as outlined by the Governor’s Executive Order 20-08. With the exception of situations detailed in point #6 in this document, employees should not be required to use accrued leave during school closure.</p>
<p class="p1">11. While employers have the authority to assign all staff duties to implement the requirements of the governor’s executive order regardless of the provisions of current CBAs, school district CBA provisions that are not in conflict with the governor’s executive orders remain in place.</p>
<p class="p1">We are all in this crisis together, and each of you is critical to our mission of providing essential services to our community, which includes our students. When our schools are in crisis, our community looks to all of us to pull together and deliver unified services and messages that are supportive of our students and families and help reassure them that we are doing everything we can to guide them. It is more critical than ever that we collaborate to maintain consistent and unified communications from our organizations and members.</p>
<p class="p1">Please let us know if you have any questions or need any additional information about our efforts to support you as you support our students.</p>

			<p><b>Update as of Tuesday, March 24th.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we enter day 2 of Spring Break, I know we are all inundated with emails, phone calls, zoom meetings, and those darn Superintendent Updates.  For that reason, I will try to keep my updates short and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, thank you all for your dedication to our children, families, staff and yourself.  Thank you for your patience as we experience unprecedented times in the process of providing a Fair and Appropriate Public Education for all students.  It’s not easy and we have all assumed an enormous responsibility to work through these challenges in the best interest of our kids and community.</span></p>

			<p>Update as of Monday, March 23rd.</p>
<p>As promised, I will be checking in with staff, students and community on a regular basis to provide ongoing, updated information.  I have another meeting on Tuesday with ODE and Superintendents to discuss any changes in our plans to continue providing essential needs for our families.</p>
<p>A big THANK YOU to our staff who have the capacity to help with food service, online/virtual instruction and possibly day care for our parents who are providing essential services for our communities.  Those who cannot leave their homes for any reason – I understand. My 90 year old mother lives with us and I’m being extra careful not to expose her to what could be a life ending illness. With that said, I know those of you who do not have the capacity to help outside of your home, I know you are still going above and beyond for your family, neighbors and community as a whole.  Thank you!</p>
<p>Our students—Our students have been checking in with teachers and support staff in a virtual environment at least twice a week, more if necessary.  We know the sudden loss of the consistency and structure in a traditional brick and mortar education setting can be challenging. Fortunately, our students have been trained to access and use technology in a virtual setting to continue their education.  Thank you teachers and support staff for consistently checking in with students and families – students are comforted when they connect with you.</p>
<p>Essential Services—Some of you have been wondering about new calls for social distancing (Register Guard article) and what it means to remain open as an “essential service” (e.g. businesses) or go out (doctor appt. or grocery stores, walk in the neighborhood, etc.).</p>
<p>School Districts, under the Governor’s Executive order, were put in paid status in an effort to provide and ensure essential services are available to students (food, supplementary education) and to medical providers and first responders (childcare). We are operating, and will continue to operate, as an essential service entity until different explicit guidance is provided. It is a new way of thinking as we work under emergency conditions, but it makes sense that we would be called upon to do this critical work given our knowledge of working with children, our capacity to feed them, and our available spaces to open child care. And, as our community is reeling from the loss of work, we have been prioritized, in paid status, to provide these essential services. I know that some of our own families and acquaintances are already feeling the economic hardship from lost wages.  In regards to food services for our community we will continue to provide pick-up and deliver for families – even through Spring Break. We may do one Pick-Up and Delivery for the whole week to minimize physical contact. We ask families who need to pick up to please send only one person and families who need food to be delivered to please know we may set the bag of food outside of your door if no one is home. We anticipate that you (Staff) will be hearing about family needs that we may or may not be able to address. Please report all of these to your building leader.</p>
<p>High School and Graduation–We know this is a big question for everyone. We fully expect that all of our Seniors will be on track for graduation as we continue to function as a virtual school.  All of our high school students still have access to all their courses and should not lose any opportunity to earn credit in any one of their classes.</p>
<p>Childcare— I will know more about childcare after Tuesday’s meeting.  I do know that Shana Hockema is working with United Way, staff, administration and volunteers to come up with a plan for providing day care for our parents who are providing essential services on their job.</p>
<p>I’m continually amazed with our staff and community for your continued support in the best interest of our students and families.  Thank you Marcola!!</p>
<p>Bill</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, I commend our staff, community and students for all your efforts to make sure our community can and will survive the coronavirus challenges.  Marcola School District was well prepared for a school closure. Our students, teachers and families have experienced virtual and hybrid instruction for the past 5 years when we made sure we are a 1:1 (student to digital device) district.  We know we have some families who have poor connectivity or no connectivity to the internet and we are putting solutions in place that will allow all families to access the internet at no charge. We are creating a list of families who need technical support and we will be helping these families during and after Spring Break.  Our SpEd and SEL (Social Emotional Learning) team has done a great job of connecting to the families and students who need additional support and we are continuing to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage families who can access our </span><a href="https://www.marcola.k12.or.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to do so on a daily basis.  We are adding instructional support resources and day to day, hour to hour information as we receive the day to day, hour to hour information to report.  Please know the information changes rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, I want our families, staff and students to know we (our admin team and staff) are here to help you function through some very challenging times.  Please take care of yourselves and your family and make sure you’re checking in with Grandma and Grandpa and neighbors on a daily basis. Let’s all take care of each other – it’s the Marcola way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just finished our ODE Superintendent Meeting regarding procedures and policies for finishing the 2019-20 school year. I will share that Marcola School District is far beyond other districts when it comes to preparing for school closures and providing students with a virtual opportunity to continue their instructional program. Below are the topics of discussion for districts to tackle before bringing this school year and this virus to an end.</span></p>
<p><b>Childcare guidance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all school districts will be set up to deliver services for kids 0-5 years of age</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSD is reaching out to parents who are healthcare workers and may need child care to put plans in place after Spring Break.  Currently – it’s only health care workers who would qualify.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools will not be providing 24 hour care.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Meal Service Updates:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSD will be fully reimbursed for providing food service to our families. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our students are eligible and we will be reimbursed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>All</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MSD families can pick up food for their children at designated times.  Families who need food delivery need to call the school and provide us with your information. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Seniors Graduating on Time:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state is proposing different minimum requirement for our seniors to graduate, however this has not yet been confirmed. Minimum requirements could be as low as 19 credits – we want our students to earn the full 24 credits with special considerations for students who need more support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcola School District is proficiency based and we are requiring our seniors to check in to their class/teacher on a regular basis to earn the full complement of credits for a diploma.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal for minimum credit requirements would most likely allow all of our Seniors to graduate – but they would not have the full 24 credits required for graduation (this year only).  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have some Seniors who may need additional support to finish their course work and be a legit graduate with 24 credits.  We have other seniors who can graduate now or no longer need to take a full load of classes and we can modify their schedule to meet their needs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>SBAC Testing:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next 24 hours, I’m very confident that we will get a notice all testing has been cancelled.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep your own work samples and evidence of growth/proficiency to demonstrate that we are keeping our students accountable.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have questions or concerns please call the school district at 541-933-2512 and leave a message or send me an email at </span><a href="mailto:bwatkins@marcola.k12.or.us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bwatkins@marcola.k12.or.us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Let’s keep a close eye on the physical, intellectual, emotional and social well being of our most important asset – our kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay Healthy my Friends,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill</span></p>
