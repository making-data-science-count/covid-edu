<p class="">Dear Springfield Platteview Families, </p>
<p class="">It is with a heavy heart I am writing you today to share news that I know will be difficult. Last night, <a href="https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/gov-ricketts-announces-15-counties-north-and-central-nebraska-now-included-state%E2%80%99s-directed" title="" alt="" target="_blank">Governor Ricketts ordered all schools in Nebraska to operate without students in the buildings through May 31, 2020.</a> This means our remote learning will continue through the end of the school year. We will follow our normal school calendar with student days off on April 10 and 13. The last day for seniors is May 13 and for all other students on May 21. We appreciate all the governor’s work to keep our students, staff, and families safe during this unprecedented time and understand this was not an easy decision.</p>
<p class="">This is definitely not the end of the school year that many of us had hoped for our students, staff, and families. The closure will postpone all of our spring sports and activities through May 31 as well. We will await official word from the Nebraska School Activities Association (NSAA) regarding the spring sports and activity season. This will also include postponing the commencement ceremony for seniors to Sunday, July 26 at 1:00 p.m. We will also take the next few weeks to consider many other options and creative ideas to thoughtfully recognize and honor our seniors. Many of us, including myself, have seniors and children impacted by this new course of action. We all want what is best for our students and families. We will be in touch in the next few weeks with more details.</p>
<p class="">Our remote learning is off to a good start. We understand this asks a lot of our parents and families. Please know we will continue to bring empathy and understanding to each of our families' situations as we move forward trying to educate our kids. Our goals are simple to finish out the rest of the school year. Continue to bring classmates and teachers together and get our students exposed to and participating in continued learning objectives. If your student is struggling, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our teachers, counselors, and principals for support. We want this to be a fun and rewarding learning opportunity for our students.</p>
<p class="">Our teachers and staff have been awesome with their outreach and their creativity. I’d also like to thank OPAA! and our food service staff who are serving hundreds of <a href="/Grab-and-Go-Meals" title="" alt="" target="_self">grab-and-go meals every week</a>. Many thanks to our custodial staff for deep cleaning all of our buildings and helping in other areas. Also, our administrative and support staff who have been a great help in all facets of this situation. The caring for our students and families' success is very apparent. Lastly, thank you for your continued support for our school district. We are here for you, and we will continue to connect by email, social media, Zoom, and every other way until we can be together again in person.</p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="">Brett Richards, Ed.S.<br>Superintendent</p>

<p class="">March 20, 2020<br></p>
<p class="">Hello Springfield Platteview Community School District,</p>
<p class="">Right now we are dealing with a pandemic health crisis and this is uncharted waters for all. I wanted to send a few quick tips for prevention and contact information for any medical questions you may have regarding COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), those infected with COVID-19 may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.</p>
<p class="">More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people and people with other medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease) may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.</p>
<p class="">People may experience:</p>
<p class=""></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Cough</li>
<li class="">Fever</li>
<li class="">Tiredness</li>
<li class="">Difficulty breathing (severe cases)</li>
</ul>
<p class="">The keys to preventing or slowing the spread of COVID-19 is hygiene and social distancing.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Hand hygiene:</strong><br>Follow these five steps every time.</p>
<p class=""></p>
<ol>
<li class="">Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.</li>
<li class="">Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.</li>
<li class="">Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.</li>
<li class="">Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.</li>
<li class="">Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.</li>
</ol>
<p class=""></p>
<p class=""><strong>Respiratory hygiene or cough etiquette:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li class="">Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.<br>
</li>
<li class="">Use the nearest waste receptacle to dispose of the tissue after use.</li>
<li class="">Perform hand hygiene (e.g., hand washing with non-antimicrobial soap and water, alcohol-based hand rub, or antiseptic hand wash) after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p class="">The other step to take is social distancing. The purpose of social distancing is to reduce contact between members of society to help reduce the risk and numbers of those contracting COVID-19. This is to help the health care system manage those who are ill and requiring treatment on top of treating those who require medical attention for other reasons such as car accidents, chronic disease, etc.<br></p>
<p class="">If you or someone in your family has symptoms of COVID-19, it is important to contact your health care provider for medical attention and to remain self-quarantined to your home.</p>
<p class="">Lastly, if you have any questions or want to talk to a healthcare professional, you can call the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) COVID-19 hotline at (402) 552-6645. This hotline is manned 24/7 and provides up to date prevention strategies, travel restrictions/quarantines, and the ability to talk with health professionals. You can also v<a target="_blank" href="http://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" title="" alt="">isit the DHHS website</a> for up to date information.</p>
<p class="">Please stay safe!</p>
<p class="">Thank you,</p>
<p class="">Kelli Haynes RN, MSN<br>Springfield Platteview Community School<br>District RN<br></p>
<br><p></p>

<p class="">March 19, 2020</p>
<p class="">Dear SPCS Families,</p>
<p class="">The Governor has now announced the second case of community-spread coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Omaha area. <a target="_blank" href="https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/gov-ricketts-announces-directed-health-measure-cass-douglas-sarpy-washington-counties" title="" alt="">He has now closed schools in the Cass, Douglas, Sarpy, and Washington Counties, which includes Springfield Platteview Community Schools.</a> We are to remain closed through at least April 30, 2020. This includes postponements of all sports and activities and any outside group scheduled events in or outside of our district facilities. KidsCare will also remain closed during this time.</p>
<p class="">As I said in a letter earlier this week, the district will roll out our Remote Learning Plan early next week to students and parents. We plan to begin remote teaching and learning on Thursday, March 26. This plan will include all the information you need and will hopefully answer most of your questions. Elementary principals from each school will be in communication on how students/parents can pick up iPads and other supplies from their classrooms. Secondary principals will also be in touch with information on how students can pick up any items from their lockers needed during this time.</p>
<p class="">I realize there are a lot of questions about prom, graduation, sports and activities, and many other events we all look forward to in the spring. With schools closed until April 30, we unfortunately have to announce now that our 6th-grade Outdoor Education Program, scheduled for April 16-17, and Platteview High School Prom, scheduled for April 18, will be postponed. We want to continue to make every effort not to cancel or postpone events before we absolutely have to.</p>
<p class="">Our Board of Education and administration wants to make every effort to try and reschedule these historic events for our students in the future. We will also relay any new information from the Nebraska School Activities Association as we receive it regarding spring sports and activities after this closure.</p>
<p class="">We all feel awful for our students and staff who will be missing out on the next six weeks of actually being in school, especially our seniors. We are continuing to think of alternative ideas and ways to join and celebrate our kids during and after the closure. This is a challenging time and we will be available to support any of you who need additional help or family resources. We will stay positive and continue to work together to make this happen. All of our staff will be working during the closure, including principals, counselors, teachers, and support staff. Please reach out if you need any type of assistance. Thank you for your ongoing support</p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="">Brett Richards, Ed. S.<br>Superintendent<br></p>

<p class="">March 16, 2020</p>
<p class="">Dear SPCS Families,</p>
<p class="">Good evening. We wanted to get this information to you as soon as possible. The governor held a press conference today at 3:30 p.m. with the Nebraska Department of Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt. Commissioner Blomstedt is recommending all schools in Nebraska close by the end of the week due to the coronavirus. This will be evaluated every two weeks by the Nebraska Department of Education and the Governor’s Office. </p>
<p class="">This means that Springfield Platteview Community Schools' buildings will be closed to students the rest of this week through at least April 3. The Nebraska School Activities Association already canceled activities and sports through April 3 earlier today. Both the Nebraska Department of Education and the Nebraska State Activities Association will reassess closures and cancellations as we get closer to those dates. Our district will continue to work daily with all local and state officials on the coronavirus situation, and we will reopen as soon as everyone is confident that we can safely do so.</p>
<p class="">The primary purpose of closing our buildings is to help slow community spread, keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed, and protect our families. This is a very important and difficult decision, and it is being made with one thing in mind, protecting health and safety.</p>
<p class="">Springfield Platteview Community Schools is planning to start remote learning for students on Thursday, March 26. More information and instructions on our remote learning plan will be going out to students and parents early next week. The district will use Monday, March 23 through Wednesday, March 26 to organize and plan with staff to deliver the remote and eLearning programs.</p>
<p class="">We are aware of the heavy burden that closing our buildings puts on families. We are doing everything we can to help. Our principals and staff will start reaching out next week with additional resources for families, including options for students without internet in the home and grab-and-go lunch information.</p>
<p class="">This is something entirely new for all of us. It will be challenging at times, and it won’t be perfect. I know all of our staff members love our kids and families, and we will do the best job we can to support their learning. We’ll be in touch early next week. Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="">Brett Richards, Ed.S.<br>Superintendent</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>March 13, 2020</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hi SPCS Families,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was able to attend Governor Ricketts' press conference
today where he laid out guidance for Nebraskans and schools on the state's plan
to respond to the coronavirus. Matt Blomstedt, Nebraska Department of Education
Commissioner, and other state leaders also spoke at the press conference as
well. We hope this guidance will give families an understanding of when schools
will be closed by the district and/or the state of Nebraska because of the
coronavirus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two scenarios right now that would close our
district schools. The first is if we had a student or staff member diagnosed
with the coronavirus. The district would work with local health officials on a
response to this scenario and when the district would be able to reopen. This
would be similar to what happened with Fremont schools, where they had an
infected person in their facilities and closed for two weeks to disinfect and
make sure there were no additional exposures to their students and staff. The
second scenario would be if there were two "community transmissions"
in a region of the state as shown by the <a href="https://tb2cdn.schoolwebmasters.com/accnt_325212/site_325213/Documents/Nebraska-School-Districts-ESUs.pdf" title="" alt="" target="_blank">attached map</a>. "Community
transmissions" is when a person gets infected and the state or local
health departments cannot track down how this person got infected. There are
currently 13 coronavirus cases in Nebraska, and all of them were able to be
tracked on how the person was infected. Therefore, they were able to
self-quarantine the people the person had contact with and hopefully, contained
the spread. What health officials are trying to avoid are "community
transmissions" where they are unable to contain the virus because they are
unable to figure out how the person contracted the virus in the beginning. This
would more than likely lead to more cases in the community and thus lead the
governor to cancel schools in the area/region for 6–8 weeks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our district is preparing for either scenario. Spring break
comes at a good time for us to finalize our planning. As I have said earlier,
our district is uniquely qualified to roll out a remote learning plan with our
technology initiative. If we are ever in a situation where we have a long-term
closure of our schools, we will immediately begin implementation of our plan to
make this remote learning possible for our students and families. We hope this
never needs to occur, but we want you to know we have a plan as a district and
are prepared if needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At this time, our district has not had any students or staff
become infected and there are no "community transmissions," so we
plan to continue to have school with our normal schedule and school calendar. Again,
this is a rapidly evolving situation and things can change rather quickly. We
will use the guidance from the state of Nebraska to work to limit our larger
gatherings and follow the guidelines from the state. We expect to
hear more guidance from the state on our activities and sports programs in the
near future. I will keep you all informed on these decisions as they are
relayed to us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please keep in mind this is an unprecedented situation that
none of us have ever been a part of or seen before. We will make the best
decisions possible with the help of our local and state officials along the way.
The health and well-being of students, staff, families, and community are
immensely important to all of us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You will find additional resources on this page, including a link to the video of the press conference from today, Friday, March 13, which I encourage you all to view. This contains excellent
information on why they would close schools on such a large scale and gives
guidance for all of us on what we should consider for prevention. I thank all
of you for your continued support for our school district and community, and
we'll be in touch with any new information as it happens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brett Richards<br>Superintendent</p>

<p class="">Dear SPCS Families,</p>
<p class="">I want to give you an update on the coronavirus situation from the school district’s perspective, as we are in a rapidly evolving situation. The superintendents in the metro area had a conference call with Governor Ricketts today and he will be having a press conference tomorrow morning to address when and why a school closure should happen. We plan on staying open tomorrow, and then we will have a week off for spring break.</p>
<p class="">At this time, we are still following the local and state health department guidelines for prevention, and there is no guidance that we should close. There still have been no cases of coronavirus identified in our school district.</p>
<p class="">The district has been cleaning schools daily and sanitizing throughout the day and evenings. This includes disinfecting handrails, doorknobs, desks, restrooms, and more. Our custodians have done an excellent job. Our absence rates have been low for illness in the district the last few weeks.</p>
<p class="">Platteview High School has school musical performances tonight and tomorrow night as part of our activity program. As of now, these shows will still take place. As I have said earlier, this is a rapidly evolving situation and could change in a moment’s notice. We ask that you <strong>do not attend</strong> the shows if you are feeling sick. Also, follow the guidelines listed below if you plan to attend. If you are not able to attend, Friday night’s musical will be videotaped, and DVDs will be available for $25 and Blu-Ray Discs for $35. If you do not feel comfortable attending and would like a ticket refund, we will do this at the high school office tomorrow.</p>
<p class="">The district will continue monitoring the coronavirus situation throughout spring break and will be in touch with any changes or updates as needed. As always, you are your child’s best advocate, and we encourage you to make decisions based on what you think is best for your child and family on attending school or activities.</p>
<p class="">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="">Brett Richards<br>Superintendent</p>
<p class=""><strong>Health guidelines for prevention include:</strong></p>
