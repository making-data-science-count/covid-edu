<p>Governor Murphy has announced that New Jersey schools will continue remote learning through May 15. Check our remote learning page to see a recent message from Assistant Superintendent Kosek for details about what that means in terms of learning, grades and report cards. Thank you to all our teachers, staff, parents and students for being resilient and making the best of a difficult situation.</p>

<p><strong>April 16, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Dear Staff and Families, </p>

<p>As I write this, two beautiful red cardinals are busily (and noisily) engaged in building a nest in the tree outside our kitchen window. Nature, undeterred by the coronavirus, continues to provide for its children. So do we. </p>

<p>As we enter week five since our schools were closed, I want to thank our staff and our families for all the amazing efforts they are making to provide for our kids--educationally, nutritionally, socially and emotionally. I also want to answer, to the best of my ability, some of the questions you might have as we look to the future.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>When will schools reopen?</strong> Governor Murphy will be making an announcement addressing this question on Friday. At this point, schools are closed indefinitely. I do believe there is a distinct possibility our governor will elect to close schools across our state through the remainder of this current school year.  If there is a way we can come back safely to our buildings before then, I will rejoice. In the meantime, we will continue to teach and coach and counsel. And we will continue to plan for multiple possibilities. </li>
	<li>
<strong>What is the current status of sports and clubs?</strong> During these unprecedented times, when schools are physically closed and remote learning has been implemented to reduce the spread of a global pandemic, we believe it is especially important for our students to still be engaged in the sports and activities they love and to feel connected to their teammates, their classmates, their coaches and advisers. We are grateful to our coaches and advisers for finding creative ways to instruct, inspire and support our students. We have outlined <a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/W6GRd-dHrIO5BSqaIhWkIA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgeYmfP0SFaHR0cHM6Ly9yZXNvdXJjZXMuZmluYWxzaXRlLm5ldC9pbWFnZXMvdjE1ODcwMzM1OTgvcHJpbmNldG9uazEyb3JnL28xYnFveDJ3ZG9mNzVqdTNqZHNlL0V4cGVjdGF0aW9uc2ZvclJlbW90ZUNvYWNoaW5nYW5kQWR2aXNpbmcyLnBkZlcHc2Nob29sbUIKAEcfVpheEi8ltFIgYW5kcmV3c2Nob3ZhbmVjQHByaW5jZXRvbmsxMi5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> some expectations to guide their work in this new remote learning environment. These expectations focus on providing sports- or activity-specific instruction, fostering the culture and camaraderie among the students on their team or in their club, and on continuing to enhance their own professional capacity as coaches and advisers. We recognize that our students' experience of a sport or club will look very different under the current circumstances. Nevertheless, we look forward to the new ways we are able to remotely further their fitness, their fun, and their connection to one another.  </li>
	<li>
<strong>Are there plans for end-of-year activities?</strong> We continue to hope we can return safely to school before the end of this year. We also continue to plan for the possibility that we might not. There are so many activities and events that mark for our students, and all those who care about them, the culmination of a school year or school career. We are particularly focused on our seniors and on milestone events such as prom and graduation. Administrators at PHS are already meeting with student and parent representatives to consider how to make those events most meaningful should they be postponed or held virtually. The same is true for our moving-on ceremonies at our elementary and middle schools, and even for events such as field days or end-of-year concerts. We will share more once we have more direction from the State and as our plans evolve. </li>
	<li>
<strong>How can I apply to receive meals for my children?</strong> The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic continues to take its toll on families across our country and throughout our community. One in ten people have lost their jobs. Others have had their incomes significantly reduced. Family budgets have tightened. As a school district, we are here to help. If your economic circumstances have changed, and you believe your children may qualify for the federal breakfast and lunch program, please find an application and income guidelines <a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/Yiusk5ImRs6rVOi3vIQSOg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgeYmfP0RPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpbmNldG9uazEyLm9yZy9yZXNvdXJjZXMtYW5kLW5vdGljZXMvZnJlZS1hbmQtcmVkdWNlZC1wcmljZS1sdW5jaFcHc2Nob29sbUIKAEcfVpheEi8ltFIgYW5kcmV3c2Nob3ZhbmVjQHByaW5jZXRvbmsxMi5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. A week's worth of breakfasts and lunches are distributed every Tuesday to more than 500 of our students through school buses parked in neighborhoods throughout town. In addition, beginning next Tuesday, we will be distributing a week's worth of dinners for families whose children meet the federal guidelines. We are grateful to Send Hunger Packing Princeton (SHUPP) for making the distribution of dinner possible. </li>
	<li>
<strong>What can I do to help others?</strong> The value of care and compassion is spreading far faster than this virus. I continue to be heartened by the many acts of kindness and support readily provided by groups and individuals within our community. If you want to help in some way, please visit <a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/odHkeUCYRYcdNBDuXw3HsA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgeYmfP0Q1aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmluY2V0b25jb3ZpZC5vcmcvc3RheWluZy1ob21lL3dheXMtdG8taGVscC9XB3NjaG9vbG1CCgBHH1aYXhIvJbRSIGFuZHJld3NjaG92YW5lY0BwcmluY2V0b25rMTIub3JnWAQAAAAB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">princetoncovid.org</a> and click on Ways to Help.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two cardinals in the tree outside my window are currently practicing "social distancing." Nevertheless, as a species, when faced with a threat, such as cold or lack of food, cardinals flock together for mutual protection. We continue to learn from the natural world around us. Thank you for flocking virtually to support our students, our schools and one another. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Steve</p>

<h3>Remote Learning Today</h3>

<p>Remote learning continues for the week of April 13. For the most recent information about COVID-19 in our community please check <a href="http://princetoncovid.org" target="_blank">princetoncovid.org</a>.</p>

<h3>PPS Buildings Closed to the Public</h3>

<p>Princeton Public Schools are currently operating remotely. For everyone's protection, our buildings are closed to the public. Please email communications@princetonk12.org with questions or requests. We wish you health as we respond together to the current crisis.</p>

<p>Spring Break Message</p>

<h3><strong>April 3, 2020</strong></h3>

<p>Dear Families, Staff and Students,</p>

<p>The truism about predictions regarding the future is that they are (statistically speaking) usually wrong. And the further in the future, the more likely they are to be incorrect. The short-term prediction for New Jersey, however, seems unavoidable: The number of people affected by COVID-19 is going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

<p>As we anticipate our spring break next week—which for some families isn’t a break at all, but another week of juggling work, child care, handwashing, grocery shopping, CNN watching, and computer refereeing—it is likely with a mixture of trepidation and hope. I would like to focus on the hope. Hope and heroism.</p>

<p>In this last week, we have seen some astonishing acts of generosity. They include the distribution of books and toys organized by Johnson Park and Jazams, the donation of medical-grade N95 masks by the Littlebrook community, the resurgence of (virtual) parent-teacher talking circles at Riverside, CP teachers planning a car parade to wave hello to their students, the development of a binder of Spring Break activities by a JW counselor, and a Princeton High School science teacher who was actually holding office hours with his students on the way to the hospital for a non-COVID-19 medical emergency. (We wish him a speedy recovery!) </p>

<p>We keep hearing that the best way to feel better in a crisis is to help somebody else, and we have a number of children and families who are doing exactly that. They are donating to food banks, writing notes of gratitude to sanitation workers and mail carriers, even sending videos of themselves singing songs to cheer up those who are quarantined in nursing homes.</p>

<p>And yet as we honor these acts of generosity and kindness, we also know our Princeton Public Schools community is experiencing heightened levels of anxiety and grief. An increasing number of our families have an ailing elderly relative, an immune-compromised child, or a friend or family member in a precarious health situation. So many families are struggling with a parent who is not working, or one who is working in health care, in a grocery store, or in any of the essential jobs that we all rely on, but which come with a greater risk of exposure to this virus. And sadly, some of our families have already faced a serious loss, and have even had to say goodbye to a relative remotely. Our hearts go out to you.  Know that we are inspired by your courage and resilience.  Courage, kindness, hope and heroism. These are the attributes that will carry us through this crisis, and for me these qualities have been remarkably embodied by the teachers and staff of the Princeton Public Schools. </p>

<p>Schools are not buildings. They are people. They are the trusting, caring relationships forged among staff, students and families. In the past three weeks since our schools have closed, I have actually watched those relationships deepen. I have watched as staff – most of whom are new to remote learning – reached out to one another to share technology support, creative ideas, and expressions of humor. I have watched as they connected with students through morning meetings, virtual lessons, emails and phone calls. And I have watched as they continually and creatively found ways to connect with families and with the larger community in the spirit of “joy and purpose,” which define the mission of our District.</p>

<p>Today, the staff at JP shared with our entire community a visual message of joy based on the words and wisdom of Winnie the Pooh. I have pasted that message below and will add to it my own hope that this break is a time for all of us to relax, recharge and rejoice in the relationships that bring meaning to our lives.</p>

<h3>Message from the Superintendent: Moving Forward</h3>

<p>March 24, 2020</p>

<p>Dear Students, Staff, and Families, </p>

<p>The applause began last week in Spain. </p>

<p>Following an order by the prime minister to stay in their homes, thousands of citizens throughout the country began <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/in-barcelona-the-applause-starts-at-8-pm%C2%A0" target="_blank">taking to their balconies every night at 8:00 p.m. to give a standing ovation t</a>o the health care workers who are on the front lines caring for those suffering from the coronavirus.</p>

<p>And the applause is spreading. From Spain to Italy to France and beyond, hundreds of thousands are now joining the nightly tradition. Gratitude spreads faster and is more powerful than COVID-19. </p>

<p>And so I begin this message with my own applause.  For our health workers, absolutely, but also for our educators, our parents, our students.  All of you have had your lives upended by the coronavirus; all of you are feeling anxious about your own health and those of others; and yet all of you are finding new ways to continue learning and working and showing your care for one another.  It is not always easy, I know, but you have the appreciation of many. </p>

<p>So what is next?  Our governor's executive order 104 has closed schools indefinitely throughout New Jersey.  I don't know when schools will be officially allowed to reopen, but I do know that staff and families are looking for guidance beyond this Friday, which will mark the end of our initial period of remote learning. <strong>Consequently, after consulting with our local Health Officer, I am extending the remote learning period for the Princeton Public Schools at least through Friday, April 17, 2020.</strong> We will re-evaluate as we near the end of that time period. </p>

<p>Some important points to keep in mind as we move forward:</p>

<p><strong>Our schools and offices are now all operating remotely.</strong> District buildings are open on a very limited basis only to essential employees.  If you have questions or requests, please email us.  We are trying to protect our staff, our students and our community.</p>

<p><strong>Reach out if you need food or know someone who does. </strong> <a data-page-name="Free and Reduced Price Lunch" href="/fs/pages/390" target="_blank">Here is a link </a>to our application (in both English and Spanish) to receive free or reduced priced meals during this time period when schools are physically closed. We recognize that this crisis has placed an economic hardship on many of our families - a hardship that is likely to increase.  If your economic circumstances have changed or if they do in the future, please go to the link above to review the income guidelines for receiving federally funded meals.  You can also get help in completing the application through the <a href="https://www.princetonchildrensfund.org" target="_blank">Princeton Children's Fund </a>or make a donation to a family in need.</p>

<p><strong>Spring Break will be a true break. </strong> We all need to take a breath right now.  During the week of April 6-10, please do just that.  Relax.  Laugh.  Spend time with neighbors and family - just do it from a distance and remember to wash your hands!</p>

<p>Once again, I am grateful for all that you are doing during this unprecedented time. Give yourselves a standing ovation! </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Steve Cochrane</p>

<p>Superintendent</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>March 19, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Dear Staff and Families,</p>

<p>This afternoon our Department of Health confirmed that one of our staff members at Riverside Elementary School has tested positive for COVID-19.  That person is currently in the hospital and beginning to feel better. Our thoughts are with that member of our school family.</p>

<p>The Department of Health will be reaching out to students, parents and staff who may have had more prolonged contact with this particular staff member.  A separate letter was sent to the Riverside community providing them with guidance.</p>

<p>As all of us strive to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, I want to reiterate some important reminders from our Department of Health:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
	<li>Practice social distancing stringently.  This means: stay at home; avoid non-essential trips, and maintain a six-foot distance between other people if you must go out. For children this is not a time for sleepovers, play dates, birthday parties or congregating of any kind.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most updated information regarding our community’s response to COVID-19, please go to this website: <a href="https://princetoncovid.org/">https://princetoncovid.org/</a></p>

<p>We will get through this difficult time together.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Steve Cochrane<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<h4><strong>March 16, 2020</strong></h4>

<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>

<p>Today has been a day of "firsts" as we launched remote learning, as we distributed food and technology to our students, and as we implemented the many changes necessary during this crisis. I would like to thank everyone for remaining calm in circumstances fraught with chaos.</p>

<p>As you know our current situation is incredibly fluid. Today, the Governor declared a state of emergency instituting a curfew beginning at 8:00 p.m and extending through 5:00 a.m. and there will undoubtedly be more news breaking in the coming hours.  As we all struggle to process the magnitude of this health crisis and our responses to it, we want to take the steps that keep us safe and also keep us positive.</p>

<p>If you have a Princeton High School student you may have seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B9zJdH7pG2A/?utm_source=ig_web_button_native_share">this message on Instagram</a> from Principal Jessica Baxter. It strikes the right tone of what we would like to communicate to you. Be safe. Be cautious. Set a good example for your family<b>. Our medical experts tell us that you cannot go wrong with stringent social distancing, which means avoiding contact with people outside of your household even if you are feeling well.</b> And while playdates and sleepovers are tempting, all of New Jersey is being cautioned to avoid these risks. We are doing our best at PPS to heed these increasingly urgent precautions, and to the extent it is currently possible, I am now urging all PPS employees to work from home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have finished our first day of Distance Learning. How did it go for you? How did it go for your children? If you would like to share thoughts or photos or videos please email <a href="mailto:communications@princetonk12.org">communications@princetonk12.org</a>. We know that having kids learning at home will occasionally present some challenges, but we do hope to post the positive things you may be doing as a family to support learning and to also support the emotional health of your children during this difficult time.  In addition, please look for a short survey we will be sending soon so you can give us your feedback.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to thank our staff, beginning with those who volunteered today to deliver two weeks of meals to our nearly 500 students who rely on us for breakfast and lunch.  I would like to thank our teachers who will continue to go above and beyond to thoughtfully engage their students.  And I would like to thank our custodians, our central office folks, our building secretaries, our technology department, and our principals, all of whom had important duties they fulfilled today while taking precautions to be safe.   For the next few days we will be operating with minimal staff in most buildings, with the goal of ensuring we can get computers into the hands of all those who need them to fully participate in remote learning. I am hoping that by mid-week I will be able to close at least some of our buildings and keep staff at home.</p>

<p>I will communicate with you regularly as we work to keep you informed and connected.  I would also ask you to look for information on our<a href="https://www.princetonk12.org/quick-links/remote-learning"> remote learning website page</a> and on our <a href="https://www.princetonk12.org/district/coronavirus-updates">coronavirus information page</a>, where we have recently posted new information about social distancing.</p>

<p>We will get through this together.  </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h4>March 12, 2020</h4>

<p>Dear Students, Staff and Families,  </p>

<p>After consulting this evening with our local health officials, I am announcing that the Princeton Public Schools will be moving forward with the implementation of <b>remote learning beginning</b> <b>Monday, March 16 </b>and extending initially through Friday, March 27.  During this time period, students will be learning from home with virtual support from their teachers.  Following this two week period, we will re-evaluate the continued implementation of remote learning based on guidance from our public health officials.  We believe this decision is ultimately in the best interest our students, our staff, and our entire community. </p>

<p><b>Tomorrow, Friday, March 13 will, as already planned, be an early release day</b>.  We ask that students be prepared to bring home at the end of the day any materials they may need to engage in remote instruction, including musical instruments, textbooks, computers, reading materials, athletic equipment, etc. </p>

<p>Remote learning may take a somewhat different form depending on grade level or subject.  Please look for information regarding the expectations and approach to remote learning to be posted on our website and emailed home.  Teachers will also be communicating directly with students tomorrow and in the days to come.  It is important to note that remote learning does not mean that our schools will be "closed."  Our buildings will be open and many staff will be present to answer questions and offer support. </p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to all our staff who have worked - and will continue to work - eagerly, collaboratively and creatively to provide meaningful learning experiences for our students.  I am also grateful to our students and families who I know will continue to support one another as we navigate together these uncharted waters. </p>

<p>In the coming days there will certainly be questions to answer and concerns to quell, but I am confident we will approach them all with thoughtfulness and care. </p>

<p>I wish everyone health and calm in the weeks ahead. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Steve Cochrane</p>

			<p><strong>March 11, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Dear Students, Staff, and Families,</p>

<p>Our response to the coronavirus continues to evolve.  While there are currently no known or presumptive cases in our school community, we recognize that some residents of Princeton have been exposed to the virus and may be experiencing symptoms. Consequently, after careful consultation with our local health officials, we are accelerating our preparation to provide remote learning for our students. </p>

<p>We will now have an <b>early dismissal tomorrow, March 12 and again on Friday, March 13</b> for all of our schools. Princeton High School will dismiss at 12:30 p.m. this Thursday and Friday. Our elementary and middle schools will dismiss at 1:00 p.m. </p>

<p>We will use this time to continue our preparation for remote instruction as well as to organize meals for our nearly 500 students who participate in the federal lunch program.  Please note, we have <b>postponed elementary school conferences scheduled for Thursday afternoon</b>. If you were scheduled to meet with a teacher tomorrow, Thursday, March 12, those conferences will now be held at a later date. </p>

<p>As a further measure to mitigate the spread of the virus, we have also been advised by our health officials to implement the next level of “social distancing.”  We are, therefore, temporarily postponing events that would bring larger numbers of parents, community members, or visitors into our schools. Building principals will be providing more information to their respective school communities regarding the events that will be affected. Please look for that.</p>

<p>At this time, we are carefully monitoring the situation to determine our plans for school next week. We are in ongoing communication with municipal health officials who anticipate they will soon receive results for local residents who have recently been tested for COVID-19.  The decision to implement remote learning for our students is one that considers multiple factors and will be made after careful consultation with our local board of health, the local department of health and the New Jersey Department of Health – all of whom are following the best and latest guidance from the CDC.  I will be in touch as soon as I learn more.</p>

<p>While the health experts speak of “social distancing” as a way to mitigate the spread of this pandemic, I believe it is our social connections that will ultimately guide us through it.  I am grateful for the compassion people have shown for those who are feeling anxious or vulnerable.  I am grateful for those who have offered to help in any way with the provision of instruction or food.  I am grateful for those who speak with calm and care knowing our children feel our emotions and follow our lead.  And I am grateful for those who look past stigmas and stereotypes to treat all people with respect regardless of ethnicity or country of origin.</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting one another.  We will get through this together. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Steve Cochrane<br>
Superintendent</p>

<p>Dear Students, Staff, and Families,</p>

<p>As we all read and react to the many reports regarding the coronavirus, I want to thank you for the continued calm and care with which you are approaching this situation and one another.  I also want to assure you that our District is working in tandem with our local health officials to make the very best decisions for the safety of our schools and our community. </p>

<p>Currently in Princeton, our response measures include: stringent and frequent cleaning of our buildings and buses; respiratory hygiene education and practice;<font color="#c82613" data-ogac="#c82613" data-ogsc=""><b> </b></font>careful monitoring of daily attendance and of any staff or student illnesses; and social distancing in the form of greetings other than handshakes and hugs. </p>

<p>We are also engaged in planning for the possibility of an extended school closure should our health authorities believe such a measure is warranted. I want to thank our staff for the caring, collaborative and creative way they have been working already to put in place meaningful ways to teach our students remotely and to ensure that our students who qualify for free and reduced lunch would continue to receive meals.</p>

<p>To provide our staff with additional time for that important planning, our District will be implementing an <b>Early Dismissal Day on Monday, March 16.  </b>Elementary schools and John Witherspoon will dismiss at 1:00 PM. Princeton High School will be dismissed at 12:30. After this planning day, we will share more details about what distance learning would look like for our district and how food would be distributed.</p>

<p>In addition, as we approach Spring Break, I want to reiterate <b>important precautions regarding travel</b>. The District, together with the Princeton Health Department, will be asking students or members of a household to self-quarantine for two weeks if they are returning from any country on the CDC’s Level 3 list of areas experiencing more widespread contagion. Currently those countries include China, Italy, Iran and South Korea. Additionally, local and federal health officials are advising against taking any cruises at this time. Please consult the <a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/r8cYFDgawLD5zt97MDFfUA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgSPIFP0Q-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8yMDE5LW5jb3YvdHJhdmVsZXJzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWxXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAhb5nXsBt7PFSIGFuZHJld3NjaG92YW5lY0BwcmluY2V0b25rMTIub3JnWAQAAAAB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CDC website</a> regarding foreign travel if you need more information.</p>

<p>As we continue to take measures to ensure the physical health of our community, it is equally important to provide for our mental and emotional health – and that of our children. These are stressful times. As we think about and plan for worst-case scenarios, it is hard not to feel the fear and anxiety associated with those. That is natural. Nevertheless, it is in working calmly and collaboratively and in relying on the experience and advice of our health officials, that we will make the best decisions on behalf of our kids and all those for whom we care. </p>

<p>I will continue to provide regular updates as the situation and our responses evolve.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Steve Cochrane<br>
Superintendent</p>

			<p><strong>March 6, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Dear Families,</p>

<p>Princeton Public Schools continues to work with State agencies and local health experts to take appropriate precautions with regard to the coronavirus. While information and guidelines are continually being updated, we would like to share with you some of the actions our district has put in place.</p>

<p><b>1. Education Regarding Hygiene:</b> Nurses have received instructions to teach elementary students about basic precautions, such as washing hands frequently and not touching anywhere above their neck (for example, nose, mouth, eyes).  Adults should also follow these suggestions. Hand washing should last for at least 20 seconds (or singing “Happy Birthday” twice). It takes this long for soap and water to dissolve the virus’s protective outer lipid layer. At the middle and high school, health teachers are also doing additional lessons on hand washing and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<p> <b>2. Cleaning:</b> Custodians are cleaning door handles, railings, and other frequently touched surfaces on a regular basis. The district technology department is implementing more frequent cleaning of computer keyboards. The inside of all buses are being cleaned on a regular basis. In addition, each school and the transportation department has received a special electrostatic sprayer that covers a wide area with a mild disinfectant. Not only does it kill corona and other viruses on surfaces, but its mist surrounds the surfaces making it more effective<b>.</b> Earlier this winter, PPS had two schools with high incidences of flu and these devices were used with great success to minimize illnesses. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOhXaBHT3Ho&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOhXaBHT3Ho&amp;feature=youtu.be">Click here to see a video of the sprayer in action.</a></p>

<p> <b>3. Travel Precautions:</b> With the cooperation of the Princeton Health Department, the district has asked individuals and families to self-quarantine if they have traveled to China or other high-risk locations and may have been exposed to the virus. Italy, Iran and South Korea are now also on the "Level 3" list of countries with widespread contagion. More details about this will be provided in a subsequent letter. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">please consult the CDC website</a><a href="%C2%A0https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html%C2%A0%C2%A0" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">about foreign travel particularly as you plan for future trips including any over Spring Break.</a></p>

<p><b>4. Responding to Illness:</b> School nurses are working with the Princeton Health Department and our school physician to implement protocols and procedures in line with current guidance from the NJ Department of Health for any sick students and adults seen in the Health Office. This includes putting a mask on students and adults who have a cough or fever and difficulty breathing. We are also carefully monitoring daily attendance rates across all schools. Please know that our nurses will be following NJ Department of Health guidelines and sending students home if their temperature is greater than 100 degrees.</p>

<p><b>5. Monitoring Health at Home: </b>We ask families and staff to be extra vigilant in monitoring the health of children and their own health. Students and staff should not return to school <b>until they are fever free</b> <b>for at least 24 hours</b> without fever reducing medications. We ask parents and guardians to follow the same guidance and not enter school buildings when sick to help limit the spread of all illness to the school community. </p>

<p><b>6. Remote Learning:</b> We are developing plans for remote instruction should it become necessary to close our schools for an extended period of time. The district is working to assist families who may not have access to computers or internet service at home. PPS uses Power School Learning as our platform for digital learning. We encourage all parents to check now and confirm they can access their child(ren)’s class websites by logging into<a href="https://pps.learning.powerschool.com/"> Power School Learning.</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.princetonk12.org/offices/technology/parent" target="_blank" title="https://www.princetonk12.org/offices/technology/parent">More instructions are on our website here.</a></p>

<p>If you haven't set up an account, it's a two-part process. First, set up your Parent Portal account. (Information with how to set up this account was sent at the beginning of the year.) If you need to confirm your access ID or password please reach out to your child’s guidance counselor. Once the Parent Portal account is set up, you can set up your Power School Learning account. If you need to reset your password for Power School Learning, please email the <a href="https://www.princetonk12.org/offices/technology/techstaff">technology assistant </a>at your school. </p>

<p>  <b>7. Social Distancing:</b> We are encouraging our students and staff to avoid shaking hands and instead find other creative ways to greet one another, for example fist bumps, elbow bumps, waves and bows.  This simple form of “social distancing” helps to curb the spread of any virus. Our local health officials will advise us if other forms of limiting contact need to be implemented, but at this point we can proceed with extracurricular activities, assemblies and other gatherings. </p>

<p> <b>8. Talking to Children:</b> Please remember that it is important to remain calm when talking to your child about the coronavirus. To help guide your discussion, please see the advice of the National Association of School Psychologists, Taking to Children about COVID-19 (attachment).</p>

<p>Thank you for your commitment to the wellness of our students, staff and community. We will continue to update you on the measures we are taking to promote safety and well-being in the Princeton Public Schools. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Steve Cochrane</p>

<p>Superintendent</p>

			<p><strong>Update 2-28-2020</strong></p>

<p>Dear Students, Staff, and Families, </p>

<p>At this time, the Center for Disease Control is indicating that the risk of infection from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus is low in our area. Nevertheless, we want you to know that the municipality and the school district are actively engaged in preparing for any possibility of contagion here in Princeton. The CDC and the NJ Department for Health will be providing additional guidance next week for schools, and we look forward to sharing that with you. </p>

<p>In the meantime, our nurses continue to look daily at the number of students who are out sick; we continue to follow appropriate protocols for screening new students who have spent time in areas where the virus has been more prevalent; we have increased disinfectant procedures on our buses; and we are increasing our cleaning of frequently touched surfaces in our buildings, such as door handles, sinks, keyboards, and desks. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most important measures we can all take together are the everyday actions used to prevent the spread of any respiratory disease. These include the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick. </li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. </li>
	<li>Stay home when you are sick. </li>
	<li>Keep your children home when they are sick. (Children should not return to school unless they have been fever-free without medication for 24 hours.) </li>
	<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. </li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. </li>
	<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. 
	<ul>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/">For information about handwashing, see CDC’s Handwashing website</a></p>

<p>The district is working closely with the Princeton Health Department, our school physician and other appropriate authorities to ensure that we are following best practices and the most current recommendations regarding 2019-nCoV. We will continue to update you as we get more information. </p>

<p>Please find attached to this message a fact sheet about the Coronavirus. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html">We also encourage you to check the CDC website for reliable and up-to-date information.</a></p>

<p>We appreciate your help in supporting the health of our schools and our community. </p>
