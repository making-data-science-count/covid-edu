<p><strong>April 20, 2020 (2:40 p.m.)</strong></p>
<p>Dear Wapato Public Schools Families,</p>
<p>I hope you and your family are staying healthy and well as we all continue to adjust to this new way of life under Governor Inslee’s “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order.  I have enjoyed seeing many of you at the meals distribution sites from 9:30am-12:30pm on Mondays and the Learning Resources distribution taking place on Wednesdays.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Resources Distribution</strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to check in with you and remind you that the next round of printed Learning Resources will be available for pick-up this Wednesday, April 22nd.  The distribution process will be the same as last week.  The materials will be available at your student’s school (see schedule below) or if you have the capability at home, you can download and print the same materials from the District’s website at <a href="http://www.wapatosd.org">www.wapatosd.org</a>.  Just click on the “Printable Learning Resources” title on the District’s homepage and then click on your student’s school in the panel on the right hand side of the page and look under “Printable Resources for April 22-29”.   The printable materials will be available on the District's website the afternoon of April 22nd.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>LEARNING RESOURCES DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULE</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Wapato High School (located in the parent drop off loop in the front of the school)</strong></span></p>
<p>9:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.  &amp;  1:00 p.m. – 3:30 p.m.</p>

<p>There will be staff available at each of the school’s distribution sites to insure that your students are retrieving the correct materials.</p>
<p>Please have your student’s work on their materials over the next week.  You or your student may also be hearing from their teacher as they continue to reach out to see how work on the materials is going.</p>
<p><strong>2020-2021 Kindergarten and WELCOME Preschool Registration</strong></p>
<p>Despite the school buildings being closed the District is still registering incoming Kindergarten and WELCOME Preschool students for the 2020-2021 school year.  Registration packets will be available at Camas and Simcoe Elementary Schools on Wednesdays during the distribution of printed Learning Resources in the bus-loop behind each of the schools from 9:00-11:30am &amp; 1:00-3:30pm.  Completed registration packets should be returned to Camas or Simcoe on Wednesdays during the same times listed above.  Please provide proof of residency, child’s birth certificate and child’s immunization record when dropping off completed registration packet.</p>
<p><strong>Student Medication Pick-up</strong></p>
<p>If your child has medication that is still being secured in their school’s office, a member of the District’s Health Services team will be contacting you this week to arrange for you to pick it up.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your understanding, patience and support as we work each day to navigate this crisis and do the best we can to serve our families and students.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

<p><strong>Free Student Meals Program</strong></p>
<p>In this COVID-19 Closure Update I want to remind you that the next free student meals distribution is coming up on Monday, April 13 from 9:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.  The distribution sites are Wapato High School, Wapato Middle School and Simcoe Elementary School.  Students will be provided a week’s worth of meals during Monday’s distribution.   I also want to remind you that the District has transitioned to a once a week meals distribution program that will take place each Monday from 9:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. at the three distribution sites mentioned above through the remainder of the school year.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Resources (Phase 3)</strong></p>
<p>As you know, last week the Governor announced that school buildings across the state will remain closed for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year, but that does not mean the teaching and learning has ended for the year.  <em><strong>I want to make it clear that even though buildings are closed, school is still in session and will be through June 19th, which is the last day of school this year.  </strong></em>Between now and then the District is committed to providing an effective level of teaching and learning for all our students. It started with our development of a comprehensive list of online learning resources we made available on the District’s website and was followed up last week with our first round of printed learning resources being made available to families for pick-up and on the website.</p>
<p>The next phase in our distance learning plan will be available for families next week.  We are calling it Phase 3 and it also includes printed learning resources.  Teachers and other staff have been working hard to develop these materials that will be available to families at your student’s school during this next round of distribution.  Please be aware if you have children that attend different schools you will need to go to each of those schools to retrieve the learning resources.</p>
<p>Also, last week we mentioned the next round of learning resources would be available on Monday, April 13, but in order to comply with necessary social distancing protocols and to reduce congestion with the meals distribution taking place on Monday, <strong>we have moved the learning resources distribution to Wednesday, April 15th.</strong>  Please see the schedule below for the locations and times that the Phase 3 learning resources will be distributed.</p>

<p>Also, I again want to make it very clear that the packets are solely for use in the home. Students will not be expected to return this round of packets and they will not be graded.  However, your student’s teacher may be checking in with you and your student to see how work on the materials is going.  When you do hear from teachers I encourage you to make the most of those conversations in order to make the home learning process as effective as possible.  That communication will become increasingly important as our distance learning plan continues to evolve through the remainder of the school year.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your understanding and patience as we work each day to navigate this crisis and do the best we can to serve our families and students.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

<p>Dear Wapato School District Staff, Students, Families &amp; Greater Wapato Community:</p>
<p>It seems as though the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic reshape all of our lives almost daily.  Today is certainly one of those days.  This afternoon Governor Jay Inslee announced he is extending the statewide COVID-19 school closure through the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.</p>
<p>While I understand this decision is aimed at keeping all of us as safe as possible, the thought of not being able to welcome back our students and families this school year is difficult for me and the entire Wapato Public Schools staff.  We love seeing the faces of our 3400 students arrive at school every day.</p>
<p>However, just because we won’t have the chance this year to once again fill our classrooms with students who are eager to learn does not mean the teaching and learning is going to stop.  We love the opportunity of educating kids, connecting with families and serving our community. We will continue to do our best to do that and meet the educational needs of all of our students through the remainder of this school year and beyond.   Yes, the teaching and learning is going to look different.  It won’t be a perfect system, especially in its early stages but we are committed to doing the best we can for all of our students.  Since the evolution of an effective distance learning model is going to take time I ask for the patience of our families, students, staff and community.  I also welcome the opportunity to partner with all of you as we work through this latest challenge together as a TEAM.</p>
<p>I understand today’s announcement by the Governor only adds to the growing list of questions many of you may already have regarding school.  Please understand that right now the District does not have an answer for every question it may get asked.  As we continue to receive guidance from our state education leaders and make decisions as a District we will communicate that information to you in a timely fashion just as we have throughout this crisis.</p>
<p>I hope you are all safe and following the Governor’s “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order so we are able to navigate through this crisis sooner than later.</p>
<p>Kelly Garza, Superintendent</p>

<div>Dear Wapato Public Schools Families,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for the overwhelming response to today's distribution of meals and printed learning packets. As of about noon we distributed all 18,000 meals that had been prepared. Sorry we exhausted our supplies early. We will receive more supplies next week &amp; look forward to serving families on 4/13.  Please have your students work through the learning packets over the next week.  We will be distributing the next round of printed packets on Monday, April 13.  You will be hearing more from us next week about the packets that will be available for students on the 13th. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have a safe weekend.</div>

<p>Dear Wapato Public Schools Families,</p>
<p>The District has finalized its plans for distributing the first round of printed Home Learning Resource packets to families. </p>
<p><strong>Home Learning Resources (Phase 2)</strong></p>
<p>The first installment of printed packets will be made available this Friday, April 3, 2020 at the District’s free student meals distribution sites.  Friday, April 3rd is also the day the District is consolidating its meal distribution sites down to just three locations.  <strong>Those three sites are Wapato High School, Wapato Middle School and Simcoe Elementary School.</strong> I encourage families to come to any of those three sites on Friday between 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and pick-up a home learning resource packet for each of your students.  Each site will have materials available for all grade levels (Preschool-12th Grade).   To make it easy for families the packets will be organized by grade level and/or grade level bands. <em><strong> FOR EXAMPLE: If you have a 3rd grade student and a 10th grade student you would take a packet from the box marked “3rd GRADE” and a packet from the box marked “HIGH SCHOOL”.</strong></em>  In addition to the printed materials the packets will also contain a small school supply kit students may need to complete the work.  If families have the ability to download and print pages from a home computer, each page of the printed packets will also be made available on the District’s website starting the afternoon of Friday, April 3rd.  Go to <a href="http://www.wapatosd.org">www.wapatosd.org</a> and click on the “Home Learning Resources” banner on the home page and then select the packet pages found under the appropriate grade level for your student(s).</p>
<p>We understand these materials in no way replace the high quality, face to face teaching and learning that takes place in the classroom.  The intent of the packets is to simply provide grade level appropriate resources to help keep all our students’ minds focused on learning while keeping safe at home during the closure.  <strong><em>I also want to make it very clear that the packets are solely for use in the home. Students will not be expected to return this round of packets nor will your student’s work on the packets be reviewed or graded.</em></strong>   However, I strongly encourage all families to access these materials and have your students work through the packets from April 3-12.  The next round of printed packets will be made available on Monday, April 13th.  Those are part of Phase 3 of our Home Learning Resources plan which you will be hearing more about next week.</p>
<p>In closing I want to thank all of you for your understanding and patience as we work each day to navigate this crisis and do the best we can to serve our families and students.  I can promise you that all of the District staff misses seeing all of you on a daily basis and we very much look forward to the day our students return to the classroom.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

<p>Dear Wapato Public Schools Families,</p>
<p>I hope you are all doing as well as can be expected during these uncertain times.  I know many of you are hearing about the rapid spread of the virus in our region and seeing the number of confirmed cases in Yakima County increase daily.</p>
<p><strong>Upcoming Changes to Free Student Meals Program</strong></p>
<p>This is extremely worrisome for me as the District continues to call essential employees into work on a daily basis in order to prepare and distribute the free student meals many of you have been relying on to provide some basic nutrition for your children.  I am also worried that those of you who have been relying on the meals service are having to commute daily to the distribution sites to retrieve those meals, especially considering the Yakima Health District and Governor Inslee having issued orders instructing us all to “Stay Home and Stay Healthy”.</p>
<p>So in order to limit the potential exposure to the virus for both the District staff and yourselves we are making some changes to the free student meals program. </p>
<p><strong>These are the changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, April 1, 2020: All current distribution sites will provide students with meals for two days</li>
<li>Thursday, April 2, 2020: There will be NO meals distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Starting Friday, April 3rd:  We are consolidating the distribution sites to just three locations (Wapato High School, Wapato Middle School and Simcoe Elementary School)</strong></li>
<li>Also starting Friday, April 3, 2020: There are extended hours of distribution: (9:30am-12:30pm)</li>
<li>On Friday, April 3, 2020-9:30am-12:30pm: Students will be given enough meals to cover their needs from April 3-10, (excluding the weekend)</li>
<li>On Monday, April 13: Students will receive meals for the week of April 13-17 (9:30am-12:30pm) <strong>(Distribution Sites: Wapato High School, Simcoe Elementary School, Wapato Middle School)</strong>
</li>
<li>On Monday, April 20: Students will receive meals for the week of April 20-24 (9:30am-12:30pm) <strong>(Distribution Sites: Wapato High School, Simcoe Elementary School, Wapato Middle School)</strong>
</li>
</ul>
If the school closure is extended beyond April, 24, 2020 I expect the District to continue to offer students a week’s worth of meals each Monday from 9:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. at the three locations listed above during the duration of the closure.</div>

<p>Dear Wapato Public Schools Families,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your patience and support as we have been working to meet the needs of our students, staff and families during this difficult and uncertain time. In the past couple of days our priority has been the development of learning supports for students and families during the school closure.</p>
<p><strong>Home Learning Resources (Phase 1)</strong></p>
<p>This morning we launched a new section of the District’s website dedicated to Home Learning Resources.  We encourage families to find time each day to access these resources with their students and spend a scheduled amount of time using the materials. <em><strong> FOR EXAMPLE: an elementary student could spend 30-45-minutes working with one of the math resources, take a break that involves some physical activity, and spend then another 30-45-minutes working with a reading resource.</strong> </em>You can access those online Home Learning Resources by clicking here: <a href="https://bit.ly/2ycm05L" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2ycm05L</a></p>
<p><strong>Home Learning Resources (Phase 2)</strong></p>
<p>The Home Learning Resources section on the website is only the first phase of providing families materials to support home learning for our students.  We are working on a plan for the development and distribution of printed packets that will further support student learning from home.  It is my hope that we will have phase 2 of the Home Learning Resources plan ready for families sometime next week (March 30-April 3).  As soon as we are ready to go with the distribution of the printed materials we will communicate the process for you to access those materials.</p>
<p>We are fully aware that these resources will in no way replace the in-classroom instruction delivered by our talented staff of teachers and educators. We simply hope they will give our students the opportunity maintain a certain level of quality learning from home during this school closure.</p>
<p><strong>Graduating Seniors</strong></p>
<p>When I spoke with you last regarding our efforts to keep our high school seniors on track for graduation I mentioned we were reviewing some recent guidance from the state.  District leadership and our high school administrators have finished reviewing that information and are now developing a plan that will outline what will be expected of high school seniors to stay on track during the closure.  I expect that plan will be finished by the end of this week (March 23-27).  As soon as it is ready to go, families of seniors will be hearing form their student’s school about specifics of the plan.  This information will be mailed to families as well as posted on the District’s website.  Links to the website posting will be provided through the District’s Twitter account, @wapatoSD, email and through the District’s text messaging system.  We will also send a robo-call to all families of seniors letting them know where they can find the information.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-In to District’s Text Messaging Service</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to receive text message updates from the District and have not opted-in to receive the service it is very easy.  Simply text the word YES to 67587.  <strong>IMPORTANT: <em>Your opt-in text must come from a mobile phone that is on file at your student’s school as a current contact number.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Free Student Meals</strong></p>
<p>To date, our meals service program has distributed more 6,500 meals.  Our free meals food service team, which includes cooks, bus drivers, and administrators, have done an awesome job and we appreciate them dearly.  As you may already know, on Sunday night the Yakima Health District issued tighter restrictions on top of Governor Inslee’s “Stay Home-Stay Healthy” order.  The Yakima Health District order instructs all non-essential employees to stay home.  Given the daily increase of positive coronavirus (COVID 19) cases in the region, I am concerned. </p>
<p>Our meals service program and the employees that help deliver these services are essential and rest assured our free meals service program will continue.  Nonetheless, the Yakima Health District order is worrisome.  We have multiple employees reporting to work each day to provide this service, and we have hundreds of families leaving their homes on a daily to retrieve the meals.  The safety of our students, staff, and community is a priority.  Although no final decisions about changes to our meals distribution model have been made, we are reviewing our process and model.  At some point the will most likely be an impact to how, when, and where we distribute our meals.  Please know that we will continue with normal operations until a final decision is made.  We will inform you in a timely manner about any changes that occur.</p>
<p>Again, I thank you for your patience, your understanding and support.  Please be safe by exercising social distancing and please, please continue to wash your hands thoroughly.</p>

<p>Dear Wapato Public Schools Families,</p>
<p>Like many of you I woke up this morning to the news that last night the Yakima Health District issued a “stay-at-home” order for residents of Yakima County.  The order states that residents must remain at their place of residence, except as needed for essential travel such as for food, medications and medical care and for jobs that maintain continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors. The order was effective immediately and will remain in effect until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Stay-at-Home Order Not Impacting Free Student Meals Service</strong></p>
<p>I want to assure you that, at this time, the Health District’s order WILL NOT impact the free student meals service the District has been offering since last week.  That being said I do want to remind those of you making use of the service to practice social distancing strategies while at the meals distribution sites.  District staff have been instructed and we are asking you to maintain at least 6-feet of separation from others while at the sites.</p>
<p><strong>Graduating Seniors</strong></p>
<p>On Friday night (March 20) the state provided school districts with additional guidance regarding graduating seniors.  It is lengthy and comprehensive and District leadership is working with our high school administrators in reviewing it in order to develop a plan of connecting with our seniors.  When that plan has been solidified it will be communicated to our seniors and their families.</p>
<p><strong>Plans for Optional Academic Enrichment Activities</strong></p>
<p>It is my hope the District will be ready by the end of this week to start the process of providing families access to online optional academic resources.  We are in the process right now of identifying, and in some cases creating those resources.  When they are ready they will be available through a dedicated page on the District’s website.  Once this resource has been launched it is our intent to add fresh material to it on a weekly basis during the length of the closure.  We will be sharing more about this with you as we move closer to bringing these resources online.  However, it is important our families understand these resources are not required.  They are simply supplemental and are not meant to replace core curriculum and instruction.  The engagement your students have with any of the materials will not be reviewed, they will not receive feedback from their teachers or the District and none of the work they may do involving these materials will be graded in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Childcare</strong></p>
<p>The District is gathering data to determine the need and scope of providing childcare to families, with priority being given to emergency responders and healthcare workers. I will provide more information when a determination has been made about this service.</p>
<p>In closing, I want you to know that we miss seeing all of our families on a daily basis and certainly look forward to the day we are able to return to normal business.   I hope you are all doing well.  I also hope you are protecting the well-being of yourselves and your family.  Please practice those extreme social distancing strategies we have all heard about and properly wash your hands often.</p>
<p>Kelly Garza, Superintendent</p>

<p>Good afternoon Wapato Public School Families,<br><br>With schools now closed, we understand the coming weeks will be particularly challenging for our students, staff, families and community.  We truly appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through these unprecedented times.  We want to give you an update about the support services the District is currently providing or is working to provide during the COVID-19 school district closure from March 16-April 24, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities Cleaning &amp; Sanitation</strong></p>
<p>The District’s custodians and maintenance staff have been working to clean and sanitize the buildings even before the closure started.  They have now completed that work at all the schools, the District’s Central Office and its Special Programs Building. Since completing that work no one is being allowed to enter non-essential areas of those buildings throughout the length of the closure.  For those areas that are still being used like offices, main entry-ways, restrooms, etc., those areas and high touch surfaces in those areas are being cleaned and sanitized daily.  I want to thank our custodians and maintenance staff for completing this work so quickly, thoroughly and efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Free Student Meals Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Free Grab-and-Go bagged lunches and breakfasts are now available for pickup weekdays at nine different sites.  Those sites are listed below.  The bag contains a lunch for the day of pickup and a breakfast for the following morning. </p>
<ul>
<li>All meals are free for children1-18 years of age. Children and youth will not be asked for their name, identification, enrollment status, Free and Reduced-Price meal designation, or school of attendance. Service hours for all meal distribution sites are from 11:00 a.m.-12:30 p.m.</li>
<li>Children must be present at the pickup sites to receive a meal(s).</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #cf000f">To minimize the spread of COVID-19, we ask that those picking up meals exercise social distancing protocol at the distribution sites by maintaining at least six feet of separation between yourself and any other individual at the sites.</span> </strong></li>

<p><strong>Plans for Academic Optional Enrichment Activities</strong></p>
<p>On March 13, 2020, State Schools Superintendent Chris Reykdal informed the public that the State Board of Education and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) are working to minimize the negative impact of this significant school closure on our students, particularly our graduating seniors. All state testing has been canceled for the 2020 school year.  In the meantime the Wapato School District, like school districts around the state, is working to provide families access to optional education resources during the duration of the closure.  The District is developing these resources with guidance from state education authorities and input from our skilled teaching staff.  I expect to have more details to share with you early next week (March 23-25) about what those services will entail and how all our families can access them. </p>
<p>In the meantime we are in the process of adding a section to the Wapato School District website with links to several online educational resources for students and families.  We encourage families to have their students engage with these online materials.  These resources are not meant to be a substitute for classroom instruction, however, they may help students maintain learning independently during the closure.  We hope to have that section of the website available for families by the end of the day on Monday, March 23rd.  </p>
<p><strong>High School Graduation Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) is currently working with the State Board of Education regarding graduation requirements. They will provide those guidelines to us as soon as they are available.  Those could come as early as Monday, March 23rd.  Upon receiving that guidance we will move forward with responding to the needs of our high school seniors. </p>
<p><strong>Childcare for Families of Healthcare Workers &amp; Emergency Responders</strong></p>
<p>As directed by Governor Inslee the District is hoping to provide childcare with priority being given to those families who need childcare to continue their service in the healthcare fields and/or as first responders.  In order to help us determine the scale of the need we are asking families of Wapato Public School students who are emergency responders and/or work in healthcare to please take this short survey: <a href="https://bit.ly/2J1NQ6y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/2J1NQ6y</a></p>
<p>The results of this survey will help us determine how we will forward with establishing this support service during this closure.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieving Student Medication from School</strong></p>
<p>Families that have not yet picked up their student’s medication from your child’s school and wish to do so, please call your student’s school and leave a message with your phone number and students’ name so that we can arrange for you to pick it up.  If you do not have a need for it at this time it will remain locked in the school office.  </p>
<p><strong>Health Tips Reminder</strong></p>
<p>Remember, the goal of social distancing is to stop the spread of COVID-19. The same simple steps that prevent the spread of ordinary flu viruses work against COVID-19 and other illnesses.  The District is doing its best to exercise extreme social distancing strategies by moving many of its larger group planning meetings to a digital meeting platform.  We are also following the tips we are providing you in the list below as a way to protect the well-being of each other. </p>
<ul>
<li>Practice social distancing by staying at least six feet away from each other, no handshakes, high fives, or fist bumps.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces.</li>
<li>Stay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill </li>
</ul>
<p>I understand many of you may have several other questions.  We have dedicated this section of the District’s website to COVID-19 and the decisions being made as a result of this closure.  To review the resources available, please refer to the panel seen in the upper-right area of this page. </p>
<p>Thank you again for your patience and understanding as we strive to answer your questions during this unprecedented time.  </p>

<p>Dear Wapato School District Staff, Students, Families &amp; Greater Wapato Community:</p>
<p>Today, Governor Jay Inslee issued an emergency order that directs ALL K-12 public and private schools in the State of Washington to close beginning Tuesday, March 17, 2020 in response to the coronavirus outbreak.  This closure will last through at least Friday, April 24, 2020. </p>
<p>Wapato Public Schools will be following the Governor’s order which means our schools will be in session on Monday, March 16 for classes as usual, with the closure starting on Tuesday the 17th.  This closure also includes all school district Spring season athletics.  In fact the District made a decision this afternoon to immediately suspend athletic activities.  Our student athletes will not be practicing nor competing from now through the length of the closure.</p>
<p>We understand this order results in LOTS of questions from families, students and staff.  District leadership has been anticipating and planning for this order and will be sharing additional information about the closure with our school community over the next few days. </p>
<p>Please understand this is a very evolving situation and right now the District does not have an answer for every question it may get asked.  We ask for the patience of our families, students, staff and community as we collaborate with our local and state health and education authorities to navigate this unprecedented crisis in our state and country.</p>
<p>Rest assured that by working together we will get through this.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<p>Dear Wapato School District Staff, Students, Families &amp; Greater Wapato Community:</p>
<p>District leadership continues to closely monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in our region and make decisions that support the safety and well-being of our school community and the community at large. </p>
<p>Starting today, March 13, and lasting through at least April 12, I have instructed all school administrators to cancel any non-essential evening events. These would include gatherings like the High School Spring Concert, Adams Elementary Math Night, PTO Meetings, Parent Advisory Meetings, etc.  I have also instructed our schools to restrict its audiences or participation of daytime events, like the Simcoe 1st Grade Music Program and the Satus 3rd Grade Music Program, to just the students and staff of the school in which the performance or event is taking place.</p>
<p>I understand a family’s disappointment of not being able to see their student perform but it is for the health and safety of our students, staff, families and community at large that we are forced to make these difficult decisions.</p>
<p>The District is also making a change to the format of its upcoming parent conferences for all grade levels.  The conference schedule will remain the same, including early release for students, but the District is transitioning from in person conferences to a tele-conference format.  So instead of families coming to their student’s school, conferences will be handled via a phone call.  Prior to conferences starting, families can expect to receive more specifics from their student’s school about this change.</p>
<p>According Governor Jay Inslee, right now the top priority across the state is to reduce the spread of infections.  The cancellations and social distancing decisions being made by Wapato Public Schools are meant to help minimize the potential spread of the virus while at the same time be the least disruptive as possible to our mission of providing quality education to all our students.</p>
<p>As the District works to navigate this health crisis it continues to consult and take guidance from state and local health and education authorities.  That guidance will undoubtedly result in the District having to make more difficult decisions moving forward.</p>
<p>We will get through this and I appreciate your support as we work together.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<p>Dear Wapato School District Staff, Students, Families &amp; Greater Wapato Community: </p>
<p>As many of you may have already heard by now, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has now been confirmed in Yakima County. The Yakima Health District is reporting that two people have been diagnosed with the virus.  </p>
<p>In light of this information, which I learned about first thing this morning, a decision has been made to cancel tonight’s Wapato Middle School Spring Choir/Band Concert and the Migrant Program’s General Parent Meeting which was also planned for tonight. </p>
<p>At this time the cancellations DO NOT include any daytime school events that are on the calendar for the rest of this week.  They will take place as scheduled, however the format of those events may be altered to exercise some social distancing.  Also at this time, High School athletics (practices and games, both home and away) will continue as scheduled. </p>
<p>Also, since the spread of the virus is a rapidly evolving situation the District is looking ahead to next week and beyond.  It will be reviewing planned events like the upcoming parent conferences to determine if changes need to be made to minimize person-to-person contact. If and when those decisions are made we will inform you in a timely manner.    </p>
<p>Please know it is as disappointing for me as it is for all of you to cancel these types of gatherings.  However, given the seriousness of this emerging health crisis we have to be proactive in our efforts to limit the spread of this virus.  The safety and well-being of our students, staff, and families are our priority.  </p>
<p>These are challenging times but with your support we will get through them together. </p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding. </p>

<p>Dear Wapato School District Staff, Students, Families &amp; Greater Wapato Community: </p>
<p>Earlier today Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced mandatory social distancing protocols for those areas in the greater Seattle region (King, Snohomish &amp; Pierce Counties) being hardest hit by the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).  The guidelines call for limiting public gatherings to 250 people or less. Furthermore, if there is an event of 250 or less, social distancing (no shoulder to shoulder) is highly advised. </p>
<p>While I am fully aware the Governor’s directive currently speaks to only those highly affected areas in Western Washington, it is in the best interest of our students, staff, families and community that we as a school district continue to be precautionary and work to limit the possible spread of COVID-19 with some social distancing of our own.  </p>
<p>So, after careful consideration and counsel, a decision has been made to cancel this year’s Cultural Unity Fair (CUF) that was scheduled to take place Thursday, April 2nd at Wapato Middle School.  As most of you know this is one of the most well attended community events of the year.  Hundreds of people gather in the Middle School’s gym and cafeteria areas putting them in close contact with each other. </p>
<p>I understand this decision is disappointing for many, it is for me as well. CUF has a deep history and meaning for many of us.  This was not an easy decision but I am confident it is the right decision at this time. </p>
<p>Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Yakima County right now, that could change at any time.  The safety and well-being of our students, staff, and families are our priority. I truly appreciate your understanding and support of this decision.  </p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

<p>Dear Wapato School District Staff, Students, Families and Community </p>
<p>I want to assure you that the District continues to closely monitor the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and the impact it is having on schools and communities in the region, state and across the country. As of right now there are no confirmed COVID-19 cases in Yakima County but that could change at any time. </p>
<p>As a result, and acting out of an abundance of caution, the District has decided: </p>
<ul>
<li>To limit non-required travel of staff and students outside of Yakima County.</li>
<li>We are also suspending the use of our school facilities to groups/events/activities that would include participants coming from outside of Yakima County.</li>
<li>These measures will be effective today, March 11, 2020 thru April 12, 2020.     </li>
</ul>
<p>As shared before, we are in constant communication with the Yakima Health District for guidance and they are supportive of these proactive measures. I have also been communicating with nearby school district Superintendents, and many are implementing similar proactive measures.  </p>
<p>At this time, with the exception to the measures stated above, we will continue with all scheduled activities as noted in our District calendar.  Please know that this situation is fluid and may change from day to day causing us to make additional decisions about school district events and/or daily operations.  If/when any additional decisions are made that impact school district operations or events you will be informed in a timely manner </p>
<p>The safety and well-being of our students, staff, and families are our priority. I truly appreciate your understanding and support.  </p>
