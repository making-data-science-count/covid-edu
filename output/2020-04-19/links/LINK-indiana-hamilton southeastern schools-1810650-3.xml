<strong>SKYLERTS</strong> <strong>| Beginning Jan. 28, 2020</strong>
</h1>

<h3><strong>April 17 | 5:30PM</strong></h3>

<p>Our first week back from Spring Break, and we have received some questions that I would like to discuss with you from parents and students about eLearning. The questions concern the location of assignments. We are aware that the practice of placing assignments is not consistent across the district.  In many cases, the teachers discussed their individual practice with their students before we went on this extended break. We are working to inform teachers that this is a problem for parents and students, but I want parents to be aware that there will be inconsistencies from level to level, because not all the grade levels use the same tool to communicate eLearning assignments. The secondary grades use Canvas and the elementary uses tools such as Seesaw. We will try to streamline this as much as possible, but there are unique features to the learning experiences from class to class that may require placement of assignments in different locations.<br>
 <br>
You will notice around the district that we have barricades in our parking lots. This is in response to our parking lots being used as gathering spaces, in violation of the Governor’s restrictions on gatherings of ten or more. For those who must use the parking lot area of buildings such as Fishers High School or New Britton Elementary for internet hot spots, please know that you are welcome to work around those barricades. <br>
 <br>
We served over 11,000 meals this week for over 1,200 students. This represents roughly 33 percent of the students who are eligible to receive this assistance. If you know of a family who is in need of this support but may have no transportation or who may not know how to submit an application, please contact our Food Services Director Andria Ray by phone or email. That <a href="https://www.hseschools.org/services/food">contact information</a> is on our website.<br>
 <br>
Our school board met this week in a virtual format, and among other important matters, took action to authorize the continued compensation of our employees who have been furloughed due to the COVID-19 crisis. Not only does this provide relief for those employees, it also qualifies the district to access funds made available by the CARES (Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security) Act. We are glad to be able to provide this support, but look forward to seeing everyone on the job as soon as possible. <br>
 <br>
And when is that? Like you, we continue to look toward the Governor’s office for guidance on planning for the answer to that question.<br>
 <br>
In the meantime, please take care of yourselves; continue to abide by the CDC guidelines, and we will get through this.  After all, we’re #INthistogether.</p>

<h3><strong>April 10 | 4:30PM</strong></h3>

<p>Next week school resumes -- online. I want to remind everyone that eLearning will take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Students are encouraged to turn in their assignments in a timely manner, but they do have until the following Monday as a final due date for assignments.  </p>

<p>With the extension of eLearning, our teachers will be focusing on what we call “essential” skills and standards for Quarter 4. These essentials are the priority or prerequisite for next year. While many of these skills are academic in nature, it is of particular importance at the elementary level to be sure these skills are balanced with more natural and playful family experiences since students are not engaging in typical daily play or interactions with classmates.</p>

<p>As difficult as balancing working from home and eLearning can be, we encourage you to try and think about how to prepare dinner as a family, play board games, enjoy downtime in the backyard, complete household chores and extend bedtime stories to help create a sense of security and interaction to support our youngest learners.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we will continue to develop further talking points for your family to use, to help young children understand these difficult times we are in.</p>

<p>For our seniors, please be attentive to announcements from Mr. Urban, our principal at Fishers High School, and Mr. Cripe, principal at HSE High School. Together, they are working with students, parents and community leaders to develop alternatives in celebrating your achievements. Commencement planning remains a priority, and for that also, be attentive to their communication.</p>

<p>Next week we begin our food distribution again. If you know of a student or family in need of food support, please contact us by emailing our food services director, Andria Ray. If our process could be better developed to serve those in need, please let us know.</p>

<p>Next Wednesday evening at 7:00 is our first school board meeting under the restrictions of social distancing. We will be livestreaming the meeting, as usual, but only three board members will be there physically, as the other four will be participating virtually. Like our students and staff, our school board members are also adapting.</p>

<p>Finally, as you may have heard, we lost one of our staff, Marc Farrow, this week to the COVID-19.  We grieve with and for his family. </p>

<p>I ask all of you to continue to do all you can to take of yourselves and one another. If you have questions concerning support at this time, be it medical, academic, emotional, financial or mental health related, go to our website where we have provided links to resources. Remember we’re #INthistogether.</p>

<h3><strong>April 3 | 6:30PM</strong></h3>

<p>Yesterday, Governor Holcomb announced that Indiana Schools will be closed for the rest of this school year. In response, HSE will continue eLearning on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from April 14 to May 21. Assignments will be due on Mondays. As an example, eLearning assignments made on April 14, 15 or 16 will be due on Monday, April 21. We have clarified this so that students and parents understand that there is no pressure for students to complete all their work on a day that it is assigned. We realize that some assignments take more time to process, and we encourage students to take the time allotted to them to carefully complete those assignments.</p>

<p>Students and parents have asked when they might come into our schools to claim their materials, equipment or other belongings left behind. Until the Governor lifts the “stay at home” restriction, which has been extended today to April 20, or “groups under ten” restrictions, we will not be opening our buildings.</p>

<p>Likewise, we have been asked about those restrictions and our high school graduation ceremonies. To all you seniors, I am so sorry that this crisis has had such a negative impact on the end of your final year in high school. While I can say that we will do all that we can to recognize your accomplishments, I also understand your disappointment. All of our planning for graduation is on hold until we know whether the restrictions will remain in place. If graduation exercises must be cancelled, we will work at alternative plans. </p>

<p>It seems that much of our planning has been revised from day to day. We will be issuing a newly revised set of “<a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/ZGEEN3PgdFrNXHxJrZpSlg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaOQNP0RYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHNlc2Nob29scy5vcmcvaGFwcGVuaW5ncy9jb3ZpZC0xOS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi9jb3ZpZC0xOS0oY29yb25hdmlydXMpLXVwZGF0ZVcHc2Nob29sbUIKAACNsIde2RuYLFIaZXBhY2VhYmJvdHRzQGhzZS5rMTIuaW4udXNYBAAAAAE~">Frequently Asked Questions</a>” later today. Please check our website for that information. We will continue to update that information as circumstances necessitate.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please comply with the requests of health and government officials to observe social distancing, shelter in place and constantly wash hands. We can all do our part to keep one another safe and healthy. We can overcome this challenge; after all, we’re #INthistogether.</p>

<h3><strong>April 2 | 4:00PM</strong></h3>

<p>This afternoon, it was announced by Governor Eric Holcomb and State Superintendent Jennifer McCormick that <b>all schools will remain closed through the end of the school year</b>. This means that students and staff will not return to their classrooms and/or schools, and instruction will continue via eLearning. The last official day of school is Friday, May 22. We know this may come as a disappointment to many of our students, especially our seniors. We are working on alternative plans for commencement and will keep you updated. In addition, please continue to check our <a href="https://www.hseschools.org/happenings/covid-19-information">COVID-19 webpage</a> and <a href="https://www.hseschools.org/happenings/covid-19-information/covid-19-(coronavirus)-update">Frequently Asked Questions section</a> for new information.

<h3><strong>March 31 | 6:00PM</strong></h3>

<p>It is an extraordinary time as we -  together - navigate the rapidly-evolving COVID-19. With so much information coming at you in all forms and directions, it’s easy to get swept up in the uncertainty, panic and sadness as more people become impacted by the virus each day.</p>

<p>However, it’s especially important to still find time to take care of yourself and your mental health. Please take the next 90 seconds to watch this quick video, which has some easy to follow self-care tips.<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/qjlHjCapVeMnkXlctgm48Q~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgZPH9P0QcaHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9Eclg5clRnTEJ2SVcHc2Nob29sbUIKAAB9voNelAPGKFIUdGhlbXVscm95c0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAAE~&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585778777793000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExyUQowanKAHjca7Eti4Zbp-MjyQ" href="http://youtu.be/DrX9rTgLBvI" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-image-whitelisted="" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=c81b72e367&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1662718943873908267&amp;th=17132a11eaeabe2b&amp;view=fimg&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ-_jmeZzS0XQ8u0t8fDoqFVi1I6wS_p9lwPlC3CS9_ZXwl7tB_OarRaDqYq6KSzVNlBV8p0ctaBPsoOvIWm6EDgimIPWjNTdcYAoBTTU1IeHPkYbag3YZMN21E&amp;disp=emb"></a>Also, you can download a self-care worksheet that will help you organize a plan of action by <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/-wLbVVoh8yr3m240taMlDw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgZPH9P0RfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHNlc2Nob29scy5vcmcvSFNFL21lZGlhL0hTRS1EaXN0cmljdC1Eb2N1bWVudHMvaGVhbHRoL015LVNlbGYtQ2FyZS1BY3Rpb24tUGxhbi5wZGZXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAfb6DXpQDxihSFHRoZW11bHJveXNAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAB&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585778777793000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1FNzGlqInks_MKKWDHlje1TtS8A" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/-wLbVVoh8yr3m240taMlDw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgZPH9P0RfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHNlc2Nob29scy5vcmcvSFNFL21lZGlhL0hTRS1EaXN0cmljdC1Eb2N1bWVudHMvaGVhbHRoL015LVNlbGYtQ2FyZS1BY3Rpb24tUGxhbi5wZGZXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAfb6DXpQDxihSFHRoZW11bHJveXNAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.   </p>

<h3><strong>March 27 | 6:00PM</strong></h3>

<p>HSE Teachers have made contact with more than 97 percent of our students through eLearning in grades 5-12. Student participation in the elementary is much more difficult to measure, but knowing the bond between teacher and student at that level, it could even be higher.</p>

<p>I open this update today with a resounding thank you! For your partnership with us in addressing the learning needs of so many students in so many different and creative ways, we thank you. For supporting your children as learners pivoting from traditional classroom-mode to cyber-mode, we thank you. For your patience as we make our way through this crisis, we thank you.</p>

<p>But I ask you for even more patience. Many familiar features of a typical end of school year will be altered, and many still remain unclear. Perhaps the biggest question is whether we will resume after May 1. I wish I could provide you with an answer. I can’t, and so much of our planning hinges on that unknown.</p>

<p>For those of you with high school and junior high age children, we will not have final exams this year, and semester grades at all levels will be calculated using achievement data from both third and fourth grading periods.</p>

<p>At the high schools, commencement exercises are in question. Students who have spent 13 years to earn the privilege of a graduation ceremony are now wondering, as are many of you, if that ceremony will even take place. If we are not able to conduct those exercises according to plan, I cannot predict when or where they may take place, but I believe I speak for the School Board when I say that we will have a ceremony recognizing the milestone of graduation in a fitting manner.<br><br><span style="color:#0000FF;">Operation Right Time Advisory Committee, the committee charged with the study of school start times, will proceed on a revised timeline, with participants to be named next week</span>. I anticipate that we will still meet the deadline for a recommendation to the school board in October.</p>

<p>A very sobering reality of the COVID-19 crisis is that our revenue is dependent on income, property and sales tax receipts. It is unknown what impact the closures and the unemployment will have on our local and state economy. <span style="color:#0000FF;">The Indiana Department of Education assured us as recently as today that budget reductions are not anticipated for this year. We need to look beyond</span>. To prepare for a potential impact, we will be reconvening a committee that previously studied and proposed areas of our operations for budget reductions. </p>

<p>As we are trying to regroup and plan for the end of the year and beyond, some routines continue:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have new enrollees who are awaiting admittance. We welcome our new students and are scheduling them with their new teachers, despite the eLearning environment.</li>
	<li>Some of our students will continue to need food supplements. We are planning distributions again after spring break to targeted recipients.</li>
	<li>Case conferences must be conducted, and we will be working with parents to schedule those conferences, perhaps on days other than eLearning days.</li>
	<li>
<span style="color:#0000FF;">We continue to move forward on construction of an elementary building in Wayne Township to replace Durbin Elementary for K-4 programming</span>.</li>
	<li>A staff of over 2,000 will always have individuals who require medical attention. I ask that you keep in your thoughts and prayers those on our staff who are themselves coping with the effects of the coronavirus.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am proud of our teachers and our students. And quite honestly, I am proud of so many of you. Go on Twitter and Facebook and you will see example after example of innovative practices and inspiring achievement happening at the intersection of home and school.</p>

<p>As I began this update, I now end it by saying thank you! Thank you for the honor of allowing us to work with your children. We miss them and look forward to when they return and we are able to interact with them on a daily basis. I remind you to monitor our website for announcements, and most importantly I remind you to take care of yourselves and stay healthy.</p>

<h3><strong>March 26 | 3:00 p.m.</strong></h3>

<p>Please be aware that that a staff member at Hamilton Southeastern High School tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, March 24. As of this afternoon, we have been notified of a second individual, who works in various buildings, testing positive for COVID-19. It is unknown when these individuals contracted the virus; therefore, out of caution, we are sending this notification.</p>

<p>The last known date these individuals had potential contact with anyone in the district was on March 13, 2020. As a reminder, all HSE schools have been closed since then and if one factors in the 14-day quarantine, the final date of concern would be Friday, March 27.<br>
If you or anyone in your family is experiencing symptoms in line with COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider for guidance. We encourage you to monitor yourselves and your family for the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p>Fever</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cough</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Body Aches</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Shortness of Breath </p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Per the Indiana State Department of Health, you should proceed as though everyone has been exposed to COVID-19 by continuing to practice social distancing and remaining at home. Remember hand washing and respiratory etiquette for coughs and sneezes, especially if you have to report for work or travel to obtain essential items.<br>
The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> is an excellent resource to find reliable information. We encourage you to educate yourselves on what you can do to protect yourself and your family. As more information is released, it will be posted on our dedicated <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/6MDZbGMbX74RIWlt9pp2Xw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVnGTP0Q6aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHNlc2Nob29scy5vcmcvaGFwcGVuaW5ncy9jb3ZpZC0xOS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvblcHc2Nob29sbUIKAAATPnVesx3kFFIaZXBhY2VhYmJvdHRzQGhzZS5rMTIuaW4udXNYBAAAAAE~">COVID-19 Information webpage</a>.<br>
Please know that we face this public health concern together and we must all take care of ourselves and one another. Thank you for your efforts to promote responsible and safe practices.</p>

<h3><strong>March 20 | 6:00 p.m.</strong></h3>

<p>Until this week, eLearning for me has been an option that I have authorized for teachers and students. This week, however, like many of you caregivers, I have been working with students, a kindergartener and a fourth grader, on eLearning assignments. And I have a profound respect for the planning, the coordination, and the effort that our teachers have dedicated to those assignments. Technology is a wonderful connector from students to their teachers and classmates. I also have a profound respect for what it takes for parents and other caregivers to make the eLearning count.</p>

<p>Governor Holcomb’s announcement yesterday that all schools across the state will be closed until May 1 has necessitated a change in plans. Next week we will begin a new schedule of eLearning. eLearning will take place only on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Monday and Friday are considered Emergency Closure days and will not be programmed. As announced earlier, for the following week, March 30 to April 2, there will be no eLearning days. As you know, Spring Break runs from April 3 until April 12.  </p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="/HSE/media/HSE-District-Graphics/News/IMG_7149.PNG"></p>

<p>After Spring Break, for three weeks, from April 13 until May 1, schools will remain closed; however, we want to make every reasonable attempt to prepare our students for the future. The schedule for eLearning for that period will, therefore, resume on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday basis.</p>

<p>The Indiana Department of Education has also stated that the following statewide testing requirements for School Year ’19-’20 have been canceled: <em>IREAD-3, ILEARN, ISTEP+, I AM, WIDA Screener and ISPROUT</em></p>

<p>I would like to tell you exactly what the future holds for our students, staff and schools, but at this time, all I can say is we will continue to monitor the situation closely and follow the guidance of local, state and federal leaders.</p>

<p>As we prepare to enter into another week of eLearning, I want to thank our dedicated teachers for planning and executing lessons that are keeping our students on-track with their studies. We have seen many of our educators experiment with new and innovative ways to increase class engagement from afar, and for that we are grateful. To our parents, we also want to extend our sincerest gratitude for your continued partnership. Know that we are here to assist you and your family in any way that we can.</p>

<p>Thank you for your flexibility and patience as we respond to changes related to COVID-19. It is important to remember through these uncertain times to take care of yourself, your families and each other.<br>
 <br>
As reported yesterday by the news, Governor Eric Holcomb announced several precautionary measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Indiana. We too, are taking every measure to keep our school community safe and healthy, and following the recommendations initiated by Gov. Holcomb yesterday.<br>
 <br>
If you are sick with COVID-19 or suspect you are infected with the virus:</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p><strong>Stay home</strong> unless you need to seek medical care.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Avoid public areas and public transportation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is the COVID-19 (Coronavirus)?</strong><br>
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) virus, and we are learning more about it every day. There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. Symptoms include: cough, fever and shortness of breath. In rare cases, COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, kidney failure or death.<br>
 <br><strong>What can I do to help prevent illness? </strong><br>
The most important thing you can do is remain calm, prepared, and informed. It also is important to take standard illness prevention tips. The same steps you take to reduce the spread of flu or other respiratory illnesses are key tools for reducing the spread of coronavirus.<br>
 <br><strong>How the public can help: </strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p>Stay home when you are sick. The CDC recommends that you remain home until you are “fever free” for at least 24 hours.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms that cause concern.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, or by coughing into the inside of your elbow. Throw any used tissues away in trash.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Avoid touching eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in and around your home. </p>
	</li>

 <br><strong>How do I explain COVID-19 to my family?</strong><br>
Don’t be afraid to discuss COVID-19 with your children, but let them guide the conversation. It is important to provide facts without promoting a high level of stress. Remind your children that the adults are working to address this concern and give them actions they can take to protect themselves.</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p><strong>Early elementary school children</strong> need brief, simple information that should balance COVID-19 facts with appropriate reassurances that their schools and homes are safe and the adults are there to help keep them healthy. Give simple examples of the steps people take every day to stop germs and stay healthy, such as washing hands. Use language such as “adults are working hard to keep you safe.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Upper elementary and intermediate school children</strong> will be more vocal in asking questions about whether they truly are safe and what will happen if COVID-19 comes to their school or community. They may need assistance separating reality from rumor and fantasy. Discuss efforts of school and community leaders to prevent germs from spreading.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Junior high school and high school children</strong> are able to discuss the issue in a more in-depth (adult-like) fashion and can be referred directly to appropriate sources of COVID-19 facts. Provide honest, accurate, and factual information about the current status of COVID-19. Having such knowledge can help them feel a sense of control. </p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is HSE Schools doing to prevent the spread of germs?</strong><br>
HSE Schools will be closed  starting Monday, March 16  through April 12. We will assess the spread of the virus and will communicate if additional time off is needed prior to April 10.<br><br><strong>What happens if a student or staff member is exposed to or diagnosed with COVID-19?</strong><br>
While there have not been any confirmed cases at HSE Schools, the district will follow local and  state health department guidelines. If there is a confirmed case, we will report it to the Hamilton County Health Department and the Indiana State Department of Health and follow their recommendations.<br>
 <br><strong>Will school- and district-sponsored trips be canceled due to concerns of COVID-19?</strong><br>
School- and district-sponsored travel to locations with travel advisories for COVID-19 as identified by the CDC or the U.S. Department of State have been canceled.<br>
 <br><strong>Will I be refunded for canceled field trips?</strong><br>
We are currently  working with vendors and locations to secure either refunds and/or new dates to reschedule field trips.<br>
 <br><strong>What about travel over Spring Break?</strong><br>
Any person returning from Spring Break travel with COVID-19 symptoms may be required to self-quarantine. The CDC has issued no official recommendations regarding domestic travel at this time, but all travelers should practice general preventative measures. Regarding international travel, the CDC recommends avoiding nonessential travel to countries with a level 3 travel health notice. Additionally, anyone returning from countries with a CDC level 2 or 3 travel health notice may be instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days. For more information on this, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">click here</a>.<br>
 <br><strong>Will HSE Schools continue to host/attend events?  </strong><br>
At this time, all scheduled events have been canceled until further notice.<br>
 <br><strong>Will athletics/extra-curricular practices continue while schools are closed?</strong><br>
All activities held at HSE school facilities are canceled until further notice.<br>

<p><strong>What is HSE Schools doing to prevent the spread of germs?</strong><br>
In all schools, custodians have been instructed to make cleaning touchpoints a high priority. They are concentrating on disinfecting areas, such as light switches, drinking fountains, doorknobs, etc. School buses are routinely cleaned and drivers will be paying extra attention to any areas of concern in alignment with guidance from the CDC.<br>
We are also encouraging frequent handwashing among students and staff, as it’s one of the most important steps we can take to avoid getting sick.<br>
School nurses are closely monitoring students who are showing any signs or symptoms of an infectious illness.<br>
 <br><strong>[NEW] If I am worried about the impact of COVID-19 on my student, can I keep them home from school?</strong><br>
Students who provide written documentation from their healthcare provider advising them to refrain from attending school due to COVID-19 will receive an excused absence. Families of these students should coordinate with their school’s administration for additional guidance. For all other students, normal school attendance policies remain in effect.<br>
 <br><strong>[NEW] What happens if a student or staff member is exposed to or diagnosed with COVID-19?</strong><br>
While there have not been any confirmed cases at HSE Schools, the district will follow local and state health department guidelines.

<h3><strong>February 28 | 3:30 p.m.</strong></h3>

<p>As you are aware, the coronavirus (COVID-19) is making a lot of headlines in the national news. We wanted to send you another update on what we are currently doing in our schools to prevent the spread of any illness. <br>
 <br>
Our custodians are following a “flu protocol” type of cleaning in all of our buildings. They are concentrating on disinfecting areas that are used and/or touched frequently, such as light switches, drinking fountains, doorknobs, etc. <br>
 <br>
We are encouraging frequent handwashing among students and staff, as it’s one of the most important steps we can take to avoid getting sick. Hand sanitizer is also available and can be used when needed. Our school nurses are closely monitoring students who are showing any signs or symptoms of an infectious illness.<br>
 <br>
Listed below are some additional recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help prevent the spread of germs:</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p>Stay home when you are sick. The CDC recommends that you remain home until you are “fever free” for at least 24 hours.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms that cause concern.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, or by coughing into the inside of your elbow. Throw any used tissues away in trash.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Avoid touching eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in your home.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to consult with our local, state and federal partners and follow their recommendations on the spread of the coronavirus. In the event our schools would be closed for an extended period of time, we would utilize eLearning days for students. <br>
 <br>
We are committed to the health and safety of our students and staff. For more information on the coronavirus, <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/oFvSOkgetXrflVZW0EtOTA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgOqxRP0QgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9XB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAA0XhZXqRraLRSGmVwYWNlYWJib3R0c0Boc2UuazEyLmluLnVzWAQAAAAB">click here</a>. <br>

We thank you for doing your part to keep our school community healthy.</p>

<h3><strong>January 30 | 3:30 p.m.</strong></h3>

<p>With the peak of cold and flu season upon us, we have begun receiving questions about our health and safety procedures. Our school nurses receive daily updates and guidance from the Indiana State Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the spread of illnesses and viruses.<br>
 <br>
At this time, both agencies are closely monitoring reports of a new respiratory illness called the coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. According to the CDC, the risk of infection currently in the United States is low, as the virus is not spreading person-to-person.<br>
We are committed to the health and safety of our students and staff. At this time, our custodians are following a “flu protocol” type of cleaning in our buildings. They are concentrating on disinfecting areas that are used and/or touched frequently, such as light switches, drinking fountains, doorknobs, etc.<br>
 <br>
 We will continue to consult with our local, state and federal partners to provide you any further health updates. In the meantime, we ask that you and your family take measures to prevent the spread of germs and avoid illness by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p>Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Avoid touching eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Avoid close contact with individuals who are sick.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Stay home when you are sick. The CDC recommends that you remain home until you are “fever free” for at least 24 hours.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, or by coughing into the inside of your elbow. Throw any used tissues away in trash.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms that cause concern.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for doing your part to keep our school community healthy!<br>
