<h2 style="text-align: center;">Coronavirus (COVID-19) Updates and Resources</h2>
<p>There has been a great deal of information given regarding the Coronavirus Disease, COVID-19.  We have created this web page in an effort to inform our parents, community, students, and staff on how the school is responding to this public health concern. The safety of our students and staff has always been and will always be our top priority and we continue to do our part to prevent the spread of illness in our schools. </p>
<h4>UPDATE: Schools to Remain Closed for the Rest of the 2019-2020 School Year (Posted: 4/20/2020)</h4>
<p>On April 20, 2020, Governor Mike DeWine made an announcement ordering all of Ohio’s public, community, and private K-12 school buildings to be closed to students for the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic school year due to the coronavirus health crisis.</p>
<p>We know the Governor’s order to close school for the rest of the school year presents a challenge to our families. Our district is working diligently to partner with you in furthering your child’s education and well-being. </p>
<p><strong>Remote Learning to Continue</strong></p>
<p>Although our school buildings are to remain closed, remote learning will continue through the remainder of the school year. We will continue to adjust and administer our remote learning plans and expectations, provide student services and resources to the best of our ability, and distribute free meals to our students.</p>
<p><strong>Staff Availability</strong></p>
<p>Our school staff will continue to provide meals, support, and provide remote learning opportunities to our students for the rest of the school year. Our teachers and principals will be available Monday-Friday, via email, to support our parents and students. Teachers and building principals will continue to share their remote learning plans and expectations with parents and students on an ongoing basis until the last day of school for students, May 21st. For those students who do not have access to online learning, hard copies of assignments, by grade level, will continue to be available weekly. A schedule of when copies can be picked up will be communicated each Friday, via email, for the upcoming week. </p>
<p>Administrators and support staff will also be working remotely and are available through email and voicemail. </p>
<p>Our Board of Education Office will remain open from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., Monday -  Friday. </p>
<p><strong>Meal Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Food service operations are ongoing despite the building closure and will remain in place through the last week of school. Staff will continue to comply with the most current health guidelines when distributing meals. Details regarding our meal pickup dates and times will be emailed to our families weekly and reminders will be communicated through our district’s social media pages and mobile app. </p>
<p>During the summer, the Trenton branch of the MidPointe Library will be hosting a Summer Lunch Program.  Details are being finalized by the library.  Information about the library’s program will be communicated later in May. Please look for this information on our district’s website, social media pages, mobile app, and via email once we receive final details from the library.</p>

<p><strong>Services to Students with Disabilities</strong></p>
<p>The Special Education Department will continue to make weekly contacts and work with families in an effort to provide as much continuity of services as we are able at this time.  Please continue to reach out to your child’s Intervention Specialist and/or Related Service Provider with any additional questions or concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Preschool, Kindergarten and Open Enrollment Registration for 2020-2021</strong></p>
<p>Plans for Preschool and Kindergarten registration are still being finalized.  Once details are complete, information will be communicated through our district’s website, social media pages, mobile app, and email. In the meantime, if you have questions about Preschool or Kindergarten registration, please email <a href="mailto:patti.bowers@edgewoodschools.net">patti.bowers@edgewoodschools.<wbr>net</wbr></a></p>
<p>If your student is currently open enrolled at Edgewood, you will be contacted via email by our Central Registration Office, to inquire if you wish to enroll your student for the 2020-2021 school year. Emails will be sent to those parents during the last week of April (April 27- May 1).  Students not currently enrolled at Edgewood, but are considering Open Enrollment for the 2020-2021 school year, will be able to request an application by emailing <a href="mailto:patti.bowers@edgewoodschools.net" style="background-color: initial;">patti.bowers@edgewoodschools.<wbr>net</wbr></a>.  Questions about Open Enrollment can be emailed to <a href="mailto:patti.bowers@edgewooschools.net" style="background-color: initial;">patti.bowers@edgewooschools.<wbr>net</wbr></a> .</p>
<p><strong>Board Meetings</strong></p>
<p>Boards of Education are required by law to meet at least once every two months. Although school boards typically meet more regularly than this, school boards may legally cancel school board meetings and reduce the number of school board meetings to the statutory minimum. </p>
<p>Our next Board of Education meeting will take place on Monday, April  27, 2020. Dates and times for future board meetings are posted on our district’s website as well as posted in the local newspaper. </p>
<p><strong>Access to School Facilities/Grounds</strong></p>
<p>Per the Governor’s orders and OHSAA (Ohio High School Athletic Association), all school, playgrounds, and athletic facilities, including courts, gyms, fields, gyms, and weight rooms, are to remain closed. The use of our facilities by outside groups has also been suspended until further notice.</p>
<p>We are making arrangements for staff and students to retrieve their belongings from classrooms and lockers. Once details are finalized we will communicate directions via email to our families and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduled Spring/Summer Events</strong></p>
<p>All athletics (per OHSAA guidance), field trips, overnight trips, performances, and award programs have been canceled through the remainder of the school year. </p>
<p><strong>Graduation</strong></p>
<p>The Governor and the Ohio General Assembly enacted House Bill 197 to address issues raised by the coronavirus pandemic. This legislation states that Ohio students who were on track to graduate at the time of the ordered school-building closure will be permitted to graduate on time in the Spring of 2020.</p>
<p>We recognize the importance and tradition of our high school graduation ceremony. Our graduation was originally planned to take place on Wednesday, May 20.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to hold our commencement service on this date. We are looking at alternate dates for later this summer, but we are dependent on the governor’s orders for when large public gatherings can take place.</p>
<p><strong>Summer School</strong></p>
<p>With the current building closure orders, the district will offer summer school classes virtually until further notice. Students who require summer school classes will be notified by the building principal. We are still discussing summer enrichment classes for our students and will communicate these plans with our parents in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Summer Sports Camps/Programs</strong></p>
<p>Under the current guidelines, no sport camps or summer programs will be hosted by the school district this summer. We will follow the latest directives when determining the status of summer conditioning programs for our student-athletes. Look for communication from our athletic director and coaches about summer conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>Status of </strong><strong>2020-2021 School Year</strong> </p>
<p>No specific decisions have been made at this time on the status of our buildings being re-opened in August. The state continues to monitor the status of the COVID-19 outbreak and our ability to resume normal activities. </p>
<p>In his press briefings, Governor DeWine has made it clear that Ohio’s schools and businesses will not be operating in the same way until there is a vaccine available for COVID-19. Our district administrators started planning and consulting with other education leaders and public health officials for alternatives to comply with the Governor’s most-current orders and maintain a healthy environment for staff and students.</p>
<p><strong>Work Permits for Minors</strong> </p>
<p>Work permits must be completed by the parent and employer. A physician’s signature is required on the application or a sport physical on file with the athletic department dated within the last year. Take the completed application to the Edgewood Board of Education Office with proof of age (birth certificate, driver’s license or state ID). The student must be present to sign two completed copies. <a href="https://u345601.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=KK1-2FdFmhG1lSbfSgI76427FQTaiuPbZOqBLULhLZn2A-3DX_Rs_S9S1KkB1GoEsyXAwu5DkbeZR5rC9URB8AULDJEDBIMW7kkNHqYEgsROkSECSTtIW5rRwll-2B0dTicZdy3tBFcdVc5HK74tsF6nu2I7hMSMOvBkmo8GDydBIgJF445ZicsKatMifRHWWhVAfzfPDOigZe-2FBFAj7AFJiL5tP2-2FMAsVPgA5eF2dbzZuybTEFGfo3Zv1CIqqMdRwKYHzRKj7OR-2BeUW4Qn4QGgyZQRLGMGZGU-3D">Click here for the Work Permit application (2 pages)</a></p>

</ul>
<h4>Update: Schools Closed through Friday, May 1, 2020 (Posted: 3/30/2020)</h4>
<p>On March 30, 2020, Governor Mike DeWine made an announcement extending his March 12 order for all of Ohio’s public, community, and private K-12 school buildings to remain closed to students through <strong>Friday, May 1, 2020.  </strong><a href="https://5il.co/eln1">Click here</a><strong> </strong>to read the Director's Order, signed by Dr. Amy Acton, Director Ohio Health Department, to keep schools closed through May 1, 2020.</p>
<p>We know the extension of the Governor’s school closure presents a challenge to our families. Our district is working diligently to partner with you in furthering your child’s education and well-being. </p>
<p>We are experiencing a health crisis that none of us has experienced in our lifetime. Luckily, the Edgewood community is strong and united. Together, we will navigate through this challenging situation.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for our students?</strong></p>
<p>Although our school buildings are to remain closed through Friday, May 1, remote learning will continue. We will continue to adjust and administer our virtual learning plans and expectations, provide student services and resources to the best of our ability, and distribute free meals to our students.</p>
<p>All playgrounds will remain closed until school re-opens. Likewise, all Edgewood athletic facilities, including fields, courts, weight rooms, and gyms are closed until school resumes.</p>
<p><strong>How can I reach my student’s teacher?</strong></p>
<p>For all questions related to your child’s assignments, please email your child’s teacher or the building principal. </p>
<p><strong>What about food service?</strong> </p>
<p>Our Meal Pickup Program will continue to be available for children ages 1-18 from our 3 elementary schools. The schedule for the remainder of this week is: Pickup from 11 am- Noon on <strong>Wednesday, April 1 and Friday, April 3.</strong> Children must be present for the meals to be provided. </p>
<p>Details regarding our Meal Pickup Program during Spring Break (April 6-13) will be communicated on Friday, April 3.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for graduation?</strong></p>
<p>For seniors who were on track for graduation as of March 13 (this was the last day of school prior to school closing), the graduation requirement of achieving a passing score on the EOC (End of Class) assessments is waived. If your child is on track for graduation, this lack of testing will not keep them from graduating. If a student was at risk of not meeting graduation requirements prior to March 13, our high school counselors and/or administrators will reach out to you to devise a plan to help your child work towards completion of any necessary requirements.  Specific questions concerning your senior should be addressed through email to our EHS principal at: <a href="mailto:doug.geygan@edgewoodschools.net">doug.geygan@edgewoodschools.net</a> </p>
<p>Regarding the Commencement ceremony for our seniors, our high school administrators have been in contact with Miami University and continue to be in discussion about graduation. It is a matter of waiting on guidance from the State regarding if and when large groups will be permitted to gather. </p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for the next school year/grade promotion?</strong></p>
<p>We are working through the details and we will update you as soon as we have the best information.</p>
<p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>

<ul><li>We continue to monitor and follow the guidance from the <a href="http://health.bcohio.us/our_services/novel_coronavirus.php">Butler County General Health District</a>, <a href="https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/">Ohio Department of Health</a>, the <a href="http://butlercountyohio.org/ema/">Emergency Management Agency</a>, the <a href="https://education.ohio.gov/">Ohio Department of Education</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">Centers for Disease Control</a>. We also have a great partnership with the Public Safety Director from the Butler County Educational Service Center, Katharine Clayton. Katharine is working closely with our district and all these agencies to keep Edgewood informed as decisions are made.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Will meals be provided for students while school is closed?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Yes. Plans are being finalized on how breakfast and lunch will be provided to our students in need. Details will be communicated before the end of this week. </li></ul>
<p><strong>What is the district’s plan for providing continuous learning to students?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The district has made the decision to implement the following plan, effective immediately, to ensure our students  are able to continue their education while school is closed: <ul>
<li>Teachers will be providing daily instruction and work assignments to their students in each subject area taught. The instruction and assignments will be designed to provide meaningful exposure to the grade-level curriculum that picks up where classes left off last week. </li>
<li>Teachers may make the assignments available to students through any district-approved method, and will communicate instructions to parents and students about how assignments may be accessed. Paper copies of assignments will be created for students who have limited or no access to the Internet. Details regarding how paper copies can be obtained by students/parents will be provided by your student’s teacher.</li>
<li>Teachers will be available by email to answer questions or concerns from parents or students. </li>
</ul>
</li> </ul>
<p><strong>How will students with special needs be supported while school is closed?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our Special Education staff has been working with Lindsay White, Director of Special Services, and building principals to continue with special education services and supports during this time, where possible. </li>
<li>Meetings will be convened remotely to comply with timelines and state operating standards.  Additional information will be provided as things continue to change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will student attendance be tracked during this closure?</strong></p>
<ul><li>From March 16-April 13, students do not need to do anything specific to be counted present for attendance. Since this closure is state mandated, we would encourage you to follow Governor DeWine’s guidelines and stay home as much as possible, and when necessary to go out, please practice physical distancing (stay 6 feet apart from anyone outside of your family).</li></ul>
<p><strong>Will testing still take place when school resumes?</strong></p>
<ul><li>At this time, Edgewood has not received any updates specific to state testing, AIR testing, AP testing, etc. If any updates are provided by the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) we will update this FAQ and will share the information with you.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What is the plan for the levy that was to be voted on today, March 17?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Our levy will remain on the ballot.  At this time, Governor DeWine and the Ohio Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, are proposing June 2, 2020 as the date for when elections will take place.  In the meantime, if voters would prefer to vote by mail, they have until Tuesday, May 26, 2020 to request a vote-by-mail ballot from the Board of Elections. <a href="https://elections.bcohio.us/Voter_Registration_Data/11-a%20Absentee%20Ballot%20Application%20with%20flyer.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2Rjr6fAa8ouGxVTalhBMdNOiRZ3j0Tp_Zpn7edufPKAKGjbSHJsld6N2E">Click here to download an application </a>or call 513-887-3700 to have an application mailed to you.</li></ul>

</ul>
<p>Please continue your efforts to cut down on the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) by using these key preventive measures: </p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Handwashing is extremely important in the prevention of illness.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; if you are unable to use soap and water, hand sanitizers that include 60%-95% alcohol are recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/qJG72sycQB8">Here is a great video </a>to watch with your young children about hand washing.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth since that is how germs get into the body. </li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you don’t have a tissue, then cough/sneeze into your elbow. </li>
<li>If you, or your child, are sick, stay home. If you/child have a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or greater, remain home until you/child are fever-free for a full 24-hours before returning to work.</li>
<li>Clean frequently-touched surfaces and objects using everyday household disinfectants. High-touch surfaces like door knobs, toilet handles, and sink handles should be cleaned more often. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Update: Tuesday, March 10, 2020</h4>
<p>The following information is being shared with our Edgewood families on how our district would provide continuous learning for our students in the event Edgewood would be closed for an extended period of time.

<ul>
<li>455 hours for students in half-day kindergarten;</li>
<li>910 hours for students in full-day kindergarten through Grade 6; and</li>

This action is taken each year to cover events, such as inclement weather, natural hazards, utility outages as well as medical outbreaks. Since the beginning of the school year through March 10, 2020, Edgewood has been closed a total of 15.5 hours due to a variety of events.

<li>Students would complete assignments and may submit their assignment online, using available technology from their home or local library depending upon the subject and/or teacher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Grades 6-12 </strong> <ul>

<h4>Update: Monday, March 9, 2020</h4>
<p>On Monday afternoon, March 9, Governor DeWine announced that three cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ohio. All three of these cases are individuals in their 50s from Cuyahoga County, which is located in and around Cleveland, Ohio. At this time, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) is working to identify and speak with all those who may have come in close contact with these three individuals.  Governor DeWine also issued a state of emergency and stated “people shouldn’t read too much into that. An emergency lets the state sign contracts without bidding.” </p>
<h6>Here’s what Edgewood City School District is planning to do:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Edgewood City Schools will continue on our normal schedule and bus transportation will continue to be provided to all our current routes.  We will continue to stay in contact with the Butler County General Health District should more information become available. </li>
<li>If circumstances dictate, we will institute our next level of cleaning protocols, which include shifting staff assignments to increase the number of people available for cleaning, increasing the frequency of cleaning of all common area surfaces, and instituting additional disinfection of buses. </li>
<li>We will also continue to provide updates to you as information updates are provided by our local, state, and federal health department partners.</li>
</ul>
<h6>What can you do?</h6>
<p>We encourage everyone to do their part in reducing the likelihood of an outbreak. The best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 continues to be the same preventions that are recommended for the spread of the flu and common cold, which includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handwashing is extremely important in the prevention of illness.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; if you are unable to use soap and water, hand sanitizers that include 60%-95% alcohol are recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/qJG72sycQB8">Here is a great video </a>to watch with your young children about hand washing.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth since that is how germs get into the body. </li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you don’t have a tissue, then cough/sneeze into your elbow. </li>
<li>If you, or your child, are sick, stay home. If you/child have a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or greater, remain home until you/child are fever-free for a full 24-hours before returning to school or work.</li>
<li>Clean frequently-touched surfaces and objects using everyday household disinfectants. High-touch surfaces like door knobs, toilet handles, and sink handles should be cleaned more often. </li>
</ol>
<h6>Call Center Now Open to Help with Questions on COVID-19:</h6>
<ul>
<li>The Ohio Department of Health has established a COVID-19 Hotline at <strong>1-833-4-ASK-ODH</strong> (1-833-427-5634). </li>
<li>The Call Center is open 7 days a week from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm.  The Call Center staff includes licensed nurses and infectious disease experts. They will be available to answer questions and provide accurate information about COVID-19, the risk to the public, and the state’s response.</li>
</ul>
<h6>For More Information:</h6>
<p>Additional information and guidance is available at ODH’s website: <a href="https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/">cornonavirus.ohio.gov</a> or from the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention website: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">cdc.gov</a></p>
<h4>Update: Friday, March 6, 2020</h4>
<p>The health, safety, and well-being of our students and staff are top priorities.</p>
<p>With the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) making headlines, our district wants to make sure to reinforce preventive safety measures and to offer additional information.</p>
<p>It is important to remember at the time of this posting, March 6, there are no cases in Ohio. Our district is closely monitoring the situation and taking guidance from the <a href="http://health.bcohio.us/">Butler County General Health District</a>, <a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/home">Ohio Department of Health</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</a></p>
<p>The symptoms of COVID-19 that may appear 2-14 days after exposure are similar to that of the flu; fever and cough. One additional symptom that is present in COVID-19 is shortness of breath. The virus spreads primarily the same way the common cold or flu spreads—through respiratory droplets that are produced when someone coughs or sneezes. </p>
<p>We all play a role in reducing the likelihood of an outbreak. The best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are the same preventions that are recommended for the spread of the flu and common cold. Students, staff, and families are encouraged to use these key preventive measures: </p>
<ol>
<li>Hand washing is extremely important in the prevention of illness.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; if you are unable to use soap and water, hand sanitizers that include 60%-95% alcohol are recommended. If you have young children, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJG72sycQB8&amp;feature=youtu.be">great video about hand washing</a> to share with them.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth since that is how germs get into the body. </li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you don’t have a tissue, then cough/sneeze into your elbow. </li>
<li>If you, or your child, are sick, stay home. If you/child have a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or greater, remain home until you/child are fever-free for a full 24-hours before returning to school or work.</li>
<li>Clean frequently-touched surfaces and objects using everyday household disinfectants. High-touch surfaces like door knobs, toilet handles, and sink handles should be cleaned more often. </li>
</ol>
<p>With Spring Break approaching, questions regarding travel have arisen.  The CDC has provided a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) about Travel</a> to assist in answering your questions.</p>
<p>We are closely monitoring the situation and are making the necessary preparations in case COVID-19 becomes more prevalent in our community. We will continue to update you with information about COVID-19 as we know it. </p>
<p>As always, the safety of our students, staff, and families remains our top priority and we will always act out of an abundance of caution to protect everyone’s health and well being.</p>
