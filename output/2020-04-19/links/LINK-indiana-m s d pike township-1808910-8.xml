Every year, billions of dollars in federal funding go to hospitals, fire departments, schools, roads, and other resources based on census data.</p>

<p><strong>April 8, 2020 - 5:30 p.m.</strong></p>

<p>Pike Family,</p>

<p>Thank you so much to everyone who participated in Dr. Flora’s first Facebook Live last evening. (If you missed it, you can still view it via our district Facebook page). Her next Facebook Live will be next Tuesday, April 14th, at 6:30 p.m. If you would like to submit questions in advance or have topics you would like to suggest, please feel free to email them to pthotline@pike.k12.in.us. </p>

<p>Dr. Flora received several wonderful questions. She responded to several questions during the chat and via the comments. We are in the process of creating a FAQ and responding to any questions that were not covered. </p>

<p>One of the most common questions was about when families will be able to pick up instruments and/or visit their child’s school to collect belongings. The answer is that, unfortunately, at this time, it is not possible to allow access to our buildings; however, we will share details with you as soon as we are safely able to do so. </p>

<p>She also reiterated that although we would love to be able to provide answers to questions about events such as prom, graduation, and summer school, we are simply unable to do so at this time. However, as soon as we have the information needed to begin making those decisions, we will share it with you.</p>

<p>As we continue the process of providing remote learning opportunities, questions and concerns are sure to arise. We encourage you to reach out to your child’s teachers and/or school principal. Our educators are here to support you and sincerely want to stay connected with their students and families. </p>

<p>You can contact your child’s teachers through Canvas messaging and/or email. Staff email addresses can be found by clicking on the course title and then teacher name in the Skyward grade book or via the staff directory on each school’s website. <br>
 <br>
Our educators will be available to provide support and answer questions via email or Canvas from 1 to 4 p.m. on all scheduled instructional days in most instances. (This schedule could vary slightly for some of our PHS classes). Please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>

<p> <br><strong>COVID – 19:</strong><br>
 <br>
As you know, last week, Governor Holcomb announced that our school buildings would be closed for the remainder of the school year. Today, Governor Holcomb extended his Stay at Home order until April 20th and closed state parks. At this time, Marion County remains under a warning level advisory, which allows essential travel only. The CDC also updated their recommendations and now suggest that people should wear masks in public. <br>
 <br>
Social distancing is hard on kids, but doctors say no to playdates:<br><a href="https://www.today.com/parents/can-kids-have-playdates-amid-coronavirus-doctor-says-no-t176143">https://t.co/rtyEkAIOTD?amp=1</a><br>
 <br>
Your health and well-being is our top priority. For that reason, we will not be able to allow building access at this time. As soon as it is safe for us to do so in a responsible manner, we will share those plans with you. <br>
 <br>
As much as we would like to, we are also unable to answer questions about graduation. Although we are committed to celebrating our incredible Class of 2020, it is impossible to say when that will be and what that might look like. <br>
 <br>
We cannot overstate how serious this is. Please stay at home if you are able, practice social distancing, wash your hands regularly, stay informed, and follow the guidance of medical experts. We are all adjusting to difficult circumstances over which we have very limited control. We thank you for your understanding and ask for your continued flexibility as we all strive to support our community, meet the needs of our students, take care of our staff, and serve our families in the best possible manner. <br>

<p><strong>April 2, 2020 - 7:20 p.m.</strong></p>

<p>Pike Family,</p>

<p>Today was hard. We learned that our buildings will be closed for the rest of the 2019-20 school year at the same time you did. Although we know that it is the right decision, and that we can stop the spread and save lives by staying home, it doesn't mean that this isn't really sad and a lot to process for all of us.</p>

<p>There are many things happening very quickly, which means that there are some requests we cannot responsibly grant and some questions, that as much as we would like to, we cannot answer right now. Sadly, that includes decisions regarding graduation and details regarding when we will be able to safely allow access to our schools. We know that this uncertainty is difficult, but during this crisis, circumstances are truly outside of our control.</p>

<p>Please know that we are completely committed to serving our families and doing what is best for our students at all times. We will continue to do everything we can to provide support and meet the needs of our students, staff members and their families. Keeping our students and staff safe is our highest priority and will be at the center of everything we do.</p>

<p>We will follow our remote learning schedule for April and continue to provide updates and share any additional information we may have after Spring Break.</p>

<p>We know this is not ideal and understand your frustrations. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>If you need assistance, we encourage you to call our hotline at (317) 387-2222 and leave a message.</p>

<p>Please continue to do everything you can to take care, be well, and look for the light in these challenging times. ❤️<br>

<p>This week was hard. We would like to thank you for your patience, your flexibility, and your support as we all took the first steps in what will be a long and change-filled process of figuring out how to care for ourselves and one another. It is normal to feel worried, uncertain, and even scared right now. Please do not add to any anxiety you may be feeling by expecting yourself or your new routine to be perfect. Right now, it is important to prioritize our physical and mental health and overall well-being. Part of that is knowing that just doing our best, no matter what that might be or look like, is more than enough.</p>

<p><strong>March 16, 2020 - 6:35 p.m.</strong></p>

<p>Pike Family,</p>

<p>Today, national, state, and local leaders shared sobering news and advised much more extensive recommendations, which will impact all of our lives greatly. The most important consideration remains the health and safety of our students, our staff, and their families. For that reason, we are reassessing our plans on a daily and hourly basis. </p>

<p>We will continue our food service operations as follows: </p>

<p>Out of concern for the health of our families and our staff members food distribution will be handled via a curbside, drive through process. </p>

<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, March 17th, sack lunches will be available for pick up at the Pike Freshman Center from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. This week and next week, our Red Zone Food Pantry will be open to all Pike families at the same location Monday thru Thursday from 11:00 to 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Wednesday, March 18th, packet pick up and meal services will be available at the Freshman Center and all Pike elementary and middle schools from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Each child will be provided with five meals. Children who are enrolled at the Nathaniel Jones Early Learning Center can pick up meals at Eastbrook Elementary. PPA students may visit the PFC. Gleaners back packs will also be available at each elementary school.</p>

<p>If your child will not have reliable access to a device or internet service, please be sure to notify their teacher or school prior to 10 a.m. tomorrow so we can prepare a remote learning packet for them.</p>

<p>Although we had hoped to be able to allow our orchestra and band students into our buildings for a brief window on Wednesday to pick up their instruments, that is no longer feasible.  </p>

<p>ELearning will begin on Thursday, March 19th. Your child’s teachers will be available to answer questions via email or Canvas from 8 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and noon to 2 p.m. from Thursday up until the first scheduled day of your child’s spring break.</p>

<p>If your child has forgotten their password, the following support will be available beginning Wednesday. </p>

<p>1.            Call 317-387-2525 and press 1 for students<br>
2.            Leave a message with your name, ID number, and a return phone number</p>

<p>Our counselors and social workers are available to provide support. If you need assistance, please call our hotline at (317) 387-2222 and leave a message.<br>
 </p>

<p><strong>March 15, 2020 - 6:15 p.m.</strong></p>

<p>If you are feeling overwhelmed right now, that is completely understandable. In uncertain times, the last thing anyone needs is more stress. </p>

<p>One of the best learning related things a child can do, now or ever, is read. Did you know that our students have free access to our collection of ebooks and audiobooks via a free app called Sora? You can get the app, visit the website www.soraapp.com, or access Sora through Pike Clever.</p>

<p><img alt="Check out Sora on Pike Clever or at www.soraapp.com" src="/userfiles/39/my%20files/sora%20(1).png?id=9339&amp;width=439" style="width: 439px; height: 368px;"></p>

<p>If you do not have reliable access to a device or the internet, we will be sharing information about a free book distribution next week.</p>

<p>Our teachers are hard at work planning learning experiences and our librarians are compiling a list of safe sites and resources for our students, which we will share. In the meantime, encourage your child to read, relax, and don’t feel like you need to add curriculum developer to your list of responsibilities. We are here for you.</p>

<p>Take care of yourself and call our hotline at (317) 387-2222 and leave message if you need support.</p>

<p>As a reminder, our current plans are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="Underline" style="text-decoration:underline;">Monday, March 16th </span> –  11 AM -2 PM Sack lunches and Red Zone Food Pantry Open outside Pike Freshman Center</p>

<p><strong>March 14, 2020 - 2:15 p.m. </strong></p>

<p>We have received several incredibly kind messages from people wanting to help our students and families. We are so grateful to our community for their outpouring of generosity and support.</p>

<p>Our Pike Red Zone Food Pantry provides food and supplies to Pike families throughout the year. They were able to provide food and necessary supplies to 27 families on Friday and will continue to do so in the coming days. The easiest way to help our Red Zone Food Pantry support our community at this time is to provide a monetary donation.</p>

<p>The Pike Township Educational Foundation is accepting donations via their website at https://pike-ef.org/. Please type Food Pantry in the comment section to earmark your donation.</p>

<p>Our counselors and social workers are available to talk and provide information regarding community resources. We encourage Pike families in need of support to call our hotline at (317) 387-2222 and leave a message.</p>

<p>As always, we are #PikeProud to serve our amazing community.</p>

Public School Districts of Marion County Staff &amp; Families,<br>
 <br>
Under the direction of Marion County Public Health Department (MCPHD) and in collaboration with Mayor Hogsett’s office, the public school districts of Marion County will be closed March 13 - April 5, 2020 due to Coronavirus and in an overabundance of caution.   <br>
 <br>
After closely monitoring the situation, consulting medical experts, and giving careful consideration to what is best for our students, staff, and the communities we serve, the determination has been made to close all public school districts in Marion County effective tomorrow, Friday, March 13. <br>
 <br>
Contingency plans will be put in place to ensure that meals and uninterrupted learning experiences will be available for our students.   Details and local decisions regarding meals and continued learning will be shared in the coming days by each school district.  <br>
 <br>
You will receive direct communication from your district soon that will include additional information regarding what to expect, detailed logistics, and where to find important updates.    <br>
 <br>
Although we know that this may cause challenges for our families, it is essential for us to prioritize health and safety by implementing our pandemic plans and doing everything we can to support our communities throughout this quickly evolving health emergency. <br>
 <br>
The measure to close schools is being implemented by MCPHD to slow the spread of the virus by social isolation and distancing.  For this reason, it is not encouraged that staff and students go out into public spaces frequently or large gatherings during the closure time.  <br>
 <br>
All public school districts in Marion County will remain in close collaboration with MCPHD and appropriate health authorities during this closure.  We encourage staff and families to remain engaged by visiting www.MarionHealth.org and www.CDC.gov/COVID-19 .<br>
 <br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding the Coronavirus, please call the MCPHD Coronavirus Call Center at 317-221-5500 or contact your primary care physician.  <br>

<p>Personal y Familias de Distritos de Escuelas Públicas del Condado de Marion,</p>

<p>Bajo la dirección del Departamento de Salud Pública del Condado de Marion (MCPHD) y en colaboración con la oficina del alcalde Hogsett, los distritos escolares públicos del Condado de Marion estarán cerrados del 13 de marzo al 5 de abril del 2020 debido a Coronavirus y en exceso de precaución. Alentamos a la comunidad a ver la conferencia de prensa a las 5 de la tarde celebrada por MCPHD y la oficina del alcalde.  <br>
Después de monitorear de cerca la situación, consultar a expertos médicos y considerar cuidadosamente lo que es mejor para nuestros estudiantes, el personal y las comunidades a las que servimos, se tomó la determinación de cerrar todos los distritos escolares públicos en el Condado de Marion a partir de mañana, viernes, 13 de marzo. </p>

<p>Se implementarán planes de contingencia para garantizar que las comidas y las experiencias de aprendizaje ininterrumpido estarán disponibles para nuestros estudiantes. Los detalles y las decisiones locales con respecto a las comidas y el aprendizaje continuo serán compartidos en los próximos días por cada distrito escolar. </p>

<p>Pronto recibirá una comunicación directa de su distrito que incluirá información adicional sobre qué esperar, logística detallada y dónde encontrar actualizaciones importantes.    </p>

<p>Aunque sabemos que esto puede causar desafíos para nuestras familias, es esencial para nosotros priorizar la salud y la seguridad al implementar nuestros planes de pandemia y hacer todo lo posible para apoyar a nuestras comunidades durante esta emergencia de salud en evolución rápida. </p>

<p>La medida para cerrar las escuelas está siendo implementada por MCPHD para frenar la propagación del virus mediante el aislamiento social y el distanciamiento. Por esta razón, no se recomienda que el personal y los estudiantes salgan a espacios públicos con frecuencia o a grandes reuniones durante el tiempo de cierre.  <br>
Todos los distritos escolares públicos en el Condado de Marion permanecerán en estrecha colaboración con MCPHD y las autoridades sanitarias correspondientes durante este cierre. Alentamos al personal y a las familias a mantenerse comprometidos visitando la página web www.MarionHealth.org y www.CDC.gov/COVID-19.</p>
