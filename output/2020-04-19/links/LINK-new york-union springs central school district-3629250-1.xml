Dear Union Springs CSD Community:<br><br>
By now you are no doubt aware that the world around us is changing rapidly as a result of the Corona Virus.  As governments, businesses, sports, and other social groupings curtail events in effort to contain the virus’ spread and reduce the potential for individuals to be exposed, schools have been working diligently with state and local officials to do their part in keeping students and staff safe.  Unfortunately, the time has come to close school. <br><br><strong>Effective Monday, March 16, 2020 through April 13, 2020, the Union Springs Central School District will be closed.</strong>  We are closing school along with every other school district in the Cayuga-Onondaga BOCES.  This decision was not made lightly, and we know the impact and hardship this will present for our families and community; however, the risks of this virus to our school and community necessitates closure at this time.<br>
Outlined below is our continuity plan:<br><br><strong>Curriculum</strong>: On Monday, March 16, 2020, individualized packets of school work and assignments will be mailed out to every student.  These assignments have been prepared over the past two weeks by your student’s teacher(s) and are designed to focus on review topics, skill building, and keeping concepts fresh in student’s minds while school is closed.  Please look for them in your mailbox in the coming days. <br><br><strong>Food Service</strong>:  We will have a grab and go lunch available at noon each day at the M.S/H.S. for all who need it from Monday 3/16 – Thursday 3/19.  At that time, individuals may pick up breakfast for the next morning as well.  Starting this coming Friday, we will deliver to the homes of students who qualify for free-and reduced priced meals, their meals for the following week. There will be further communication about the delivery process as we get closer to the end of the week.  If you need food assistance during this time period but do not qualify for free and reduced lunch, please reach out to food service at (315) 889-4120 and we will do our best to help.<br><br><strong>Outside Groups</strong>:  Our school buildings and facilities will be closed to <strong>all </strong>outside groups and individuals during this period of closure; this includes our fitness center.  The entire district will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected during this time, and we need to limit individuals in our spaces as we undertake this important work.<br><br><strong>Medicine</strong>: Your student’s principal and our school nursing staff will be available during the first few days of this week to assist you in picking up any prescription your child may have in school that they might need access to during this closure time period.<br><br><strong>Field Trips</strong>:  All field trips are cancelled; this includes both the senior trip and 8<sup>th</sup> grade trip to Boston, as well as the theater trip to NYC.  Teachers sponsoring these trips will be working with our business office to ensure that refunds are processed, and we will get them out to you in short order.  We will do our best to find other ways to celebrate our students and their accomplishments when we return to school.<br><br><strong>Support</strong>:  We understand that this may be a challenging time for our students and some of them may want to speak to a school counselor or require some additional supports to feel successful during this time. We encourage you to reach out to the various schools should this be the case, and our team will do our best to provide the support needed.<br><br>
We will continue to communicate and provide updates in the days and weeks ahead.  The Union Springs Central School District has been in existence to support this community since 1936, and this global pandemic will not stop that from being the case. Our existence is this community and its children, and we are taking this unprecedented action to keep everyone safe.  Thank you for your continued support.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Jarett Powers<br>
Superintendent of Schools</span>

Dear Union Springs CSD Community:<br><br>
By now you are no doubt aware that the world around us is changing rapidly as a result of the Corona Virus.  As governments, businesses, sports, and other social groupings curtail events in effort to contain the virus’ spread and reduce the potential for individuals to be exposed, schools have been working diligently with state and local officials to do their part in keeping students and staff safe.  Unfortunately, the time has come to close school. <br><br><strong>Effective Monday, March 16, 2020 through April 13, 2020, the Union Springs Central School District will be closed.</strong>  We are closing school along with every other school district in the Cayuga-Onondaga BOCES.  This decision was not made lightly, and we know the impact and hardship this will present for our families and community; however, the risks of this virus to our school and community necessitates closure at this time.<br>
Outlined below is our continuity plan:<br><br><strong>Curriculum</strong>: On Monday, March 16, 2020, individualized packets of school work and assignments will be mailed out to every student.  These assignments have been prepared over the past two weeks by your student’s teacher(s) and are designed to focus on review topics, skill building, and keeping concepts fresh in student’s minds while school is closed.  Please look for them in your mailbox in the coming days. <br><br><strong>Food Service</strong>:  We will have a grab and go lunch available at noon each day at the M.S/H.S. for all who need it from Monday 3/16 – Thursday 3/19.  At that time, individuals may pick up breakfast for the next morning as well.  Starting this coming Friday, we will deliver to the homes of students who qualify for free-and reduced priced meals, their meals for the following week. There will be further communication about the delivery process as we get closer to the end of the week.  If you need food assistance during this time period but do not qualify for free and reduced lunch, please reach out to food service at (315) 889-4120 and we will do our best to help.<br><br><strong>Outside Groups</strong>:  Our school buildings and facilities will be closed to <strong>all </strong>outside groups and individuals during this period of closure; this includes our fitness center.  The entire district will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected during this time, and we need to limit individuals in our spaces as we undertake this important work.<br><br><strong>Medicine</strong>: Your student’s principal and our school nursing staff will be available during the first few days of this week to assist you in picking up any prescription your child may have in school that they might need access to during this closure time period.<br><br><strong>Field Trips</strong>:  All field trips are cancelled; this includes both the senior trip and 8<sup>th</sup> grade trip to Boston, as well as the theater trip to NYC.  Teachers sponsoring these trips will be working with our business office to ensure that refunds are processed, and we will get them out to you in short order.  We will do our best to find other ways to celebrate our students and their accomplishments when we return to school.<br><br><strong>Support</strong>:  We understand that this may be a challenging time for our students and some of them may want to speak to a school counselor or require some additional supports to feel successful during this time. We encourage you to reach out to the various schools should this be the case, and our team will do our best to provide the support needed.<br><br>
We will continue to communicate and provide updates in the days and weeks ahead.  The Union Springs Central School District has been in existence to support this community since 1936, and this global pandemic will not stop that from being the case. Our existence is this community and its children, and we are taking this unprecedented action to keep everyone safe.  Thank you for your continued support.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Jarett Powers<br>
Superintendent of Schools<br><br><br><br><u><strong><span style="color:#58155d;">Date: March 9, 2020</span></strong></u><br><br>
Dear Parents and Caregivers,<br><br>
The Union Springs Central School District is closely monitoring the novel coronavirus and is taking preventative measures to help control its potential spread in our region.  The safety of our students is our number one priority and we are actively working with state and local agencies to have the most current information regarding this virus and steps we can take to mitigate student exposure.  We have hired on substitute cleaning staff and are adding additional cleaning and disinfecting procedures to our daily maintenance schedule. <br><br>
Like the flu or common cold, symptoms of the coronavirus can include fever, cough, trouble breathing and shortness of breath. There are no current vaccines to protect against the virus, however there are preventative measures students, staff and family members can take to help minimize its potential spread. These include:<br>
 
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available;</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands;</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick;</li>
	<li>Stay home when you are sick;</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash;</li>
	<li>Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
 <br>
While the district hopes the virus doesn’t make its way to our region, we are aware of the potential risks, will continue to monitor the situation, and will take the necessary preventative steps to ensure the safety and health of our students. We are continuously evaluating planned field trips and other extra-curricular activities during this time.  We will be in touch regarding the plans for these events as the situation warrants.  We thank you for your cooperation and patience as we navigate through this virus and its potential disruption to our educational environment.<br><br>
Sincerely, ­­<br>
 <br>
Jarett S. Powers, Ed.D.<br>
