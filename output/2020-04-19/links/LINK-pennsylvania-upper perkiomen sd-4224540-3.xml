			<p><em><strong>4/17/20:</strong></em></p>

<p>Dear UPSD Community - </p>

<p>I hope you all had a good few days of at-home learning after a restful spring break. Now that we all have had the opportunity to digest and come to terms with Governor Wolf’s announcement that schools will be closed through the remainder of the academic year, it’s time to focus on how we can maximize At-Home Learning and continue to support our students, families and staff in this new learning environment. </p>

<p>We would all prefer to have our students back in our schools, walking the hallways, enjoying each other's company in the cafeteria and participating in Upper Perk’s clubs, activities, programs and athletics. I am truly sorry to all of our students, as they have lost so much with the mandatory school closures, and I hope that they understand that our teachers and staff are doing their very best to support them on a daily basis. Thank you to all the parents, siblings, relatives, friends and caregivers that are supporting our students and teachers every day.   </p>

<p>You’ll see updates below regarding the At-Home Learning Survey that was distributed to families over spring break; resources and supports for those who may be struggling with stress, uncertainty and emotional/mental health amidst this pandemic; and more. We’ll be sharing additional information on these topics next week, as our administrative team continues to share with our faculty and staff the survey results and plan ahead for At-Home Learning. </p>

<p><em><strong>Read on for these updates and more:</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Thank You to All Survey Respondents!</strong><br>
Thank you to everyone who responded to the At-Home Learning Survey that was sent in last week’s Friday update. We had 1,050 respondents, and are currently working on analyzing the data that resulted from the survey, and sharing the results with our teachers and staff as they are planning lessons and activities for our students. Our goal now as a district is to establish a balance by maintaining academic integrity and continuity of education, while being mindful of the unique challenges that learning from home, working from home and living in our new “normal” has on our students, families and staff. Please be on the lookout for an email early next week with more information, and we will also post that information on our website at that time.</p>

<p><strong>New Coronavirus Closure FAQs</strong><br>
We know that there are lots of new questions being raised within our community since Governor Wolf’s announcement that schools will be closed for the remainder of the academic year. We do have answers for some of those questions, however many can not be answered at this time. Our administrative team has worked to compile a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Srx64Sj47SHrlBn9hOzpgCEgLZPB2vUPhVJz3SKMfw8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Coronavirus Closure FAQ</a> with some of the most commonly raised concerns, which is now available on the district website. Any questions not addressed in this FAQ may continue to be sent to <a href="mailto:questions@upsd.org" target="_blank">questions@upsd.org</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Suicide Prevention Resources</strong><br>
This is a challenging time for individuals and families within our community. Facing a worldwide pandemic, an uncertain future and being confined to one’s home is hard under the best conditions. For community members already struggling with their mental health, home life or job situation, our current state of affairs is downright terrifying. Even though we may not be able to connect with family, friends, loved ones and neighbors in person, please check-in on your fellow community members, especially those who may be struggling for a variety of reasons. As a reminder, we have a number of <a data-page-name="Suicide Prevention &amp; Awareness" href="/fs/pages/1814">suicide prevention resources</a> available on our website. Additionally, we will be sharing a compilation of student-centric mental health resources and supports from our Pupil Services team early next week.</p>

<p><strong>People Helping People</strong><br>
Last week, I shared my thanks to the organizations and individuals that have supported the Grab and Go Meals program to date. I wanted to say thanks again, and share some specifics. We received a $500 donation to support this important program from each of the following: Hereford staff’s “Casual for a Cause” Fund, Marlborough PTFS and UPMS PTFS, as well as two personal donations of $100 a piece. Thank you to ALL who have supported, and continue to support this program to help keep our students fed during this school closure. For those interested in signing up to receive meals for their student(s), or individuals wishing to contribute to the Grab and Go Meals program, please visit <a data-page-name="2020 School Closure Student Meals" href="/fs/pages/2011">this page</a> on our website. </p>

<p>Additionally, I wanted to share that we were recently contacted by The Open Link with information that UPSD’s donation of 1966 lbs. of perishable food to The Open Link’s food pantry at the start of the mandated school closure helped support the Upper Perk community in a variety of ways. With the support of the district, and many others in the community, The Open Link has been helping our neighbors in the Upper Perkiomen Valley flourish by providing social services for those in need. Find out more about the ways The Open Link is supporting our community <a href="https://www.theopenlink.org/" target="_blank">on its website</a>.</p>

<p>The Open Link remains in need of donations in order to continue to serve the greater Upper Perk community. A list of the most needed items is below, and financial donations are always appreciated. Donations can be left in the bins at the front or back of 452 Penn Street from 8am - 4pm Monday-Friday.  Please leave your personal or organization information with the donation; forms are available, or you can simply leave name/affiliation/email/phone.</p>

<p>Top Food Pantry Needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canned Tomato Products</li>
	<li>Canned Soups and Stews</li>
	<li>Canned vegetables except corn</li>

	<li>Hand Sanitizer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Closing</strong><br>
In closing, I want to recognize that as this school closure (and associated shelter-in-place orders) moves from being measured in days and weeks to being measured in months, the situation is getting more and more challenging for all of us. Days and weeks run together, with little to distinguish them from one another. Unfortunately, this is our “new normal” for the foreseeable future, and it’s a “normal” that we will likely never get used to. Our goal as a district is to do all that we can to support our students and their families, and to help keep our community members happy, healthy and learning. </p>

<p>None of us have ever been through something like this before, so as always, thank you for your patience, understanding and support as we tackle these new challenges together. If there is anything more that we can do to help support you or your family during this time, please do not hesitate to utilize the <a href="mailto:questions@upsd.org" target="_blank">questions@upsd.org</a> email address, or reach out to your building principal, counselors, teachers or others in the district. Have a pleasant weekend.</p>

<p>Dr. Allyn J. Roche<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p><em><strong>4/10/20:</strong></em></p>

<p>Dear UPSD Community - </p>

<p>Happy Spring Break! I know that this break looks a little different than we expected. I’m sure that many in our community had hoped to be traveling, visiting friends and family and enjoying time out and about in the community.  As we know, that’s not possible given the spread of COVID-19 and the associated shelter-in-place orders that have been set across the country. My plea to you over the next few days is to enjoy this break such as it is: spend quality time with the loved ones in your household; connect with family and friends over Facetime, Zoom or the phone; write a letter; go for a socially distant walk; try something new; or simply unplug and relax.</p>

<p>From the district perspective, I’ve encouraged members of our faculty and staff to truly take a very well-deserved break over this long weekend. That said, given Gov. Wolf’s announcement yesterday that schools will be closed for the remainder of the academic year, we know that there are a lot of important conversations to be had and decisions to be made in the weeks and months to come. </p>

<p>Now that our commitment to At-Home Learning is officially extended into June, we know that we need to reflect on the first few weeks and make some adjustments and fine-tune that program. As we move into May and June, we’ll need to assess the situation in the country, state and Upper Perk Valley in order to make decisions about how best to honor the Class of 2020 and recognize end-of-year events and traditions. We don’t have answers to questions about these types of events just yet, and we may not have them immediately after returning from Spring Break, but please know that we are aware of our students’ and families’ concerns, and we will share information as soon as we are able.</p>

<p>As we continue through Spring Break, and prepare for our return to At-Home Learning on Tuesday, I wanted to provide you with updates on a number of topics. Most of these are not super time sensitive, so if you are truly disconnecting during this break, feel free to read this early next week. There is one topic I want to draw your attention to, however, the very first one below. As I mentioned in my email yesterday and my superintendent’s report at last night’s Virtual Board Meeting, we are asking <strong>ALL UPSD families to complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScF3UDUhwoOis2IUa0XuKIpLtfWilbcvbPNza40XxusF4uPZQ/viewform" target="_blank">At-Home Learning Survey</a> below no later than noon on Wednesday, April 15</strong>. The data collected will help us to make necessary adjustments to the At-Home Learning program in order to help ensure that students and families are having the best possible experience while balancing learning at home during this challenging time.</p>

<p><em><strong>Read on for more information on the At-Home Learning Survey and a number of other topics:</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>At-Home Learning Survey - Complete by Noon on Wednesday, April 15</strong><br>
Governor Wolf ordered schools to close for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Knowing At-Home Learning will continue through June, feedback is critical to making this the most effective learning format possible. We would appreciate you completing one survey per child; however, one survey for all of the children in your family is also helpful. We are looking for ways to improve this experience for students and their families while still meeting the requirements set forth by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. <strong>Please complete this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScF3UDUhwoOis2IUa0XuKIpLtfWilbcvbPNza40XxusF4uPZQ/viewform" target="_blank">At-Home Learning Survey</a> no later than noon on Wednesday, April 15.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Grading During At-Home Learning</strong><br>
Concerns about student grades and the impact of At-Home Learning on a student’s grades are common themes that have come up a lot over the last few weeks. I will do my best to simplify the information and decision for grades by elementary and secondary levels. </p>

<p>For elementary schools, the beginning of the third trimester coincided with the start of At-Home Learning, and each of the three trimesters stand alone in terms of report cards, so all the work in the third trimester will be from the At-Home Learning lessons and activities. Since trimester grades at the elementary level are not combined for an overall end of year final grade, all trimesters will simply stand alone and our teachers are very aware of the challenges and needs in their classrooms, and will assess accordingly.</p>

<p>In our secondary schools, we have four marking periods, and our high school courses have both a mid-term and a final exam, along with a pre-set percentage of weight for each of them that are calculated for a student’s total grade in a course. Firstly, there will be no final exams for any middle school or high school courses this school year. Students taking AP courses for AP credit are still asked to prepare for and take the <a href="https://apcoronavirusupdates.collegeboard.org/students" target="_blank">AP exam</a> as we have no authority over that program or assessment.  </p>

<p>Knowing that the entire fourth marking period is scheduled during the At-Home Learning time, the percentages to determine final grades for both middle school and high school students has been significantly adjusted as such:</p>

<ul>
<li>For middle school – the previous marking period weight was 25% for each of the four quarters (25%, 25%, 25% and 25%).  For this year, the middle school course marking period weight will be adjusted to 28%, 28%, 28% and 16% for the 4th marking period.  </li>
	<li>For high school – the previous marking period weight was 20% for each of the four marking periods and 10% each for the mid-term and final exam. For this year, the high school course marking period weight will be adjusted to 25% first marking period, 25% second marking, 10% for the mid-term, 25% for the third marking period and 15% for the fourth marking period.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>School Calendar Moving Forward</strong><br>
Another common theme that has been discussed a lot lately is the school calendar. We continue to follow and honor the school calendar that the Board approved last August (to push back the start of the year due to the opening of the middle school and the renovations at the 4th &amp; 5th Grade Center). It is hard to believe that this is still the same school year, as that all seems so long ago!  </p>

<p>At the current time, and with all the information available to us as of today, our last student day is scheduled for Friday, June 12, 2020. We did not need to use any of the emergency snow days this winter, so we are able to remove those days and establish June 12 as the final student day.  </p>

<p>The graduation ceremony is another question. We are committed to honoring our seniors and their families, and continue to hold out hope that the traditional stadium face-to-face ceremony can be accomplished, or a modified version, so we are not making any decisions just yet, since that time period is still over two months away. We will begin to talk more seriously and plan for a few alternatives or virtual options, but nothing has been thoroughly vetted and planned at this point. Please be patient as we all hope to make this as special a graduation as possible for the Class of 2020, which has not had the smoothest school year to date. As I mentioned above, no final decisions have been made about other end-of-year traditions and events. We will share relevant information as soon as it is appropriate to do so.</p>

<p><strong>PIAA Winter Sports Championships, Spring Season and Extracurricular Activities</strong><br>
Another announcement that was unfortunately made yesterday, as a result of the school closure extension, was from the <a href="https://www.piaa.org/" target="_blank">PIAA</a> regarding the Winter Sports Championships and the entire Spring Sports Season. The PIAA announcement stated that both have been officially cancelled. This is surely a difficult pill to swallow for our student-athletes, especially those who are losing their senior season. The lost opportunities and experiences that student-athletes have worked so hard for during the off-season and prior seasons are understandably big disappointments. </p>

<p>There are so many lost opportunities and experiences with the school closures, from the Addams Family musical, to Arts Fest Week and the list goes on and on. We will continue to do our best to support all of our students, and I am sure that teachers, coaches, advisors and volunteers in our community are thinking of creative ways to recreate some of these experiences virtually, or in some other way!</p>

<p><strong>Upcoming Virtual School Board Committee Meetings</strong><br>
As a result of the current closure of school district buildings and stay-at-home orders set forth by Gov. Wolf, the Upper Perkiomen School Board has changed the following committee meetings from in-person meetings to virtual meetings. Information on how to attend/participate in these meetings will be available on the district homepage in the days before each meeting.</p>

<ul>
<li>Facilities Committee Meeting - Thursday, April 16 at 7 p.m.</li>
	<li>Finance Committee Meeting - Monday, April 20 at 6:30 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information on virtual Board and committee meetings is available <a data-page-name="Virtual School Board Meetings" href="/fs/pages/2018">on our website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Grab and Go Meals Program Update</strong><br>
As a reminder, our Grab and Go Meal distribution program is open for all K-12 students across the district. As Monday, April 13 is the final day of Spring Break, there will be NO distribution on Monday, and we will pick it up again on Wednesday, April 15 from 11:30-1 at the 4th &amp; 5th Grade Center. Information and sign-ups for distribution events in April is available <a data-page-name="2020 School Closure Student Meals" href="/fs/pages/2011">on our website</a>. </p>

<p>We have held distribution events on six dates since the school closure began, and have served a total of 2,084 meals to students. We continue to increase the number of meals served each week. This week, our third week, saw the biggest meal distribution of all three weeks with over 780 meals served! Thank you to Mrs. Germinario, the Food Services team, Mr. McFadden, Mr. Weller and many, many other volunteers for their continued support of this program.  </p>

<p>Also, thank you to our PTFS groups, faculty and support staff at Hereford &amp; Marlborough and a few other private parties that have made significant financial contributions to support and fund this program for our students. If anyone is interested in supporting the Grab and Go Meals Program, information on how to do so is available at the bottom of <a data-page-name="2020 School Closure Student Meals" href="/fs/pages/2011">this page on our website</a>. Thank you also to the Open Link for their continued support and partnership in supporting our district families during this time.  </p>

<p>If there are students/families who want to participate in the Grab and Go Meal program, we have five more distribution dates in April: April 15, 20, 22, 27 and 29.  We plan to continue with the program into May and those details will be posted later in April.</p>

<p><strong>People Helping People</strong><br>
We are pleased to share that UPHS was contacted by a local company that was looking to begin making protective gear for healthcare professionals. Mr. Moyer stepped up to use the high school’s 3D printer to make a prototype for a face shield, and pass it along to the company as they are considering various options. Additionally, our school nurses recently donated a number of medical supplies, including gloves and masks, to St. Luke's University Health Network. It is great to see members of our community supporting one another during this time!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for Participating in Virtual Spirit Days!</strong><br>
Thank you to all students, families, faculty and staff who participated on our Virtual Spirit Days! The <a data-page-name="Virtual Spirit Days" href="/fs/pages/2019">story on our website</a> has an updated photo gallery, which includes some images from this week. We will continue to think about virtual opportunities for our community members to connect after Spring Break.

<p><strong>UPN Weekly News Shows</strong><br>
The Upper Perkiomen Network (UPN) has never earned its name more than it is right now. UPN is providing access to teaching resources and news communication pieces, and it is a great resource for our teachers, students and families. During the at-home learning period, the students of UPN-News Production are still hard at work bringing our community the news. Even though they don't have access to their studio, every week, the students from alternating sections of the class will bring the entire UPSD community the UPN Weekly News Show. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9p4EaJrZ-4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">The April 8 edition of the UPN Weekly News Show is available on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>This new show also includes a new feature called Principals of Education, which gives each school community time to hear from building principals, and the entire district time to hear from me. The UPN Weekly News Show has an abbreviated version of that segment, but the entire “Principals” video can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0g2j6MaIRU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLjg3yJ2YTC-M6p2J3fuqFcvTSuww-zQOO" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Get Some Exercise and Support Special Olympics PA!</strong><br>
The 2020 Paterno Family Beaver Stadium Run (virtual edition) starts next week. Interested parties may sign up for our Upper Perkiomen Valley Team to support Special Olympics PA. During the week leading up to and on Sunday, April 19, 2020 at 11 a.m., runners and walkers of all ages and abilities can take part in the 11th Annual Beaver Stadium 3-Mile Run and 2-Mile Family Fun Walk as a virtual participant. Presented by the Sheetz Family, the virtual run/walk will enable individuals to participate at any location, any time, and at any pace at the distance of their choice (3.1 mile run or a 2 mile fun walk). Participants can walk, jog, use the treadmill, run outside or participate in another fashion.</p>

<p><strong>2020 Census</strong> <br>
Earlier this year, we sent information to families regarding the 2020 Census. In March, homes across the country received invitations to complete the 2020 Census. If you haven’t already, you should respond for your household in one of three ways: online, by phone or by mail. Responding is important, easy and safe. The census, which is constitutionally mandated, counts every person living in the 50 states, District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. The census provides critical data that lawmakers, business owners, teachers and many others use to provide daily services, products and support for citizens and our community. Every year, billions of dollars in federal funding go to hospitals, fire departments, schools, roads and other resources based on census data. The results of the census also determine the number of seats each state will have in the U.S. House of Representatives, and they are used to draw congressional and state legislative districts. There’s more information regarding the census for K-12 families <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sis/2020census/get-involved/take-home-flyer.html?utm_campaign=20200403c20s1ccedunl&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In Closing</strong><br>
I know that I speak for our entire district community when I say that we are disappointed by the news of the closing of our schools for the remainder of the school year, but we also understand that it is necessary in order to keep our community safe and healthy. To everyone in our community, please continue to do your part in following the shelter-in-place order and social distancing protocols. As a reminder, in addition to our school buildings being closed, all playgrounds, basketball courts and fields that are on school property are closed as well.  </p>

<p>Please stay positive and continue to communicate with your student’s teachers, principal and district administration. If we are aware of questions, concerns and frustrations, we can do our best to address them. General questions may continue to be directed to <a href="mailto:questions@upsd.org" target="_blank">questions@upsd.org</a> and student technology concerns may be directed to <a href="mailto:studentithelp@upsd.org" target="_blank">studentithelp@upsd.org</a>. </p>

<p>Given the current situation, it’s understandable that tensions and frustrations may increase and people are stressed with the newness and reality of our new norm. The Upper Perkiomen School District administration, teachers, support staff and team are committed to positively supporting our students and community in the true spirit of collaboration.</p>

<p>Again, I want to thank our entire district community--students, families, faculty, staff, administrators and community members--for all of the support over the last few weeks, the understanding and patience as we work through the challenges associated with this pandemic, and for all of the work that has been done and will continue to be done to support our students and families during this unprecedented school closure. </p>

<p>I wish you all a happy Spring Break, and for those families celebrating Easter or Passover, I hope you have the opportunity to meaningfully recognize those holidays and connect with loved ones, even if celebrating holidays looks a bit different in 2020 than it has in previous years. I know that I am looking forward to spending a few days with my own family, and taking the opportunity to rest and recharge for the remainder of the school year. We’ll “see” you all next week when we pick up At-Home Learning on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Dr. Allyn J. Roche<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p><em><strong>4/9/20:</strong></em></p>

<p>Dear UPSD Community - </p>

<p>As many of you have likely heard, this morning <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-extends-school-closure-for-remainder-of-academic-year/" target="_blank">Governor Wolf extended school closures through the remainder of the academic year</a>. Although this is not a shocking announcement based upon everything going on right now, the finality of the decision for schools to remain closed for the rest of the 2019-20 school year impacts all of us in a variety of ways.  With that said, UPSD’s commitment to At-Home Learning and doing our best to support our students, families and the community remains unchanged .</p>

<p>Since this announcement was just made this morning, we are still working through the specific impacts this latest news will have on the UPSD calendar and traditional end-of-year activities, as well as adjustments that may need to be made to the At-Home Learning model we have already established.</p>

<p>More information will be shared at tonight’s <a data-page-name="Virtual School Board Meetings" href="/fs/pages/2018">Virtual School Board Meeting</a>, in tomorrow’s regular Friday email blast and in the days and weeks to come. </p>

<p>In tomorrow’s email, we’ll also be sharing a link to a survey that we’re asking all UPSD families to complete, in order for our administrative team and teachers to learn more about your experiences to date with At-Home Learning. This data will allow us to make necessary adjustments, in order for our students and families to continue to have the best possible experience learning at home.</p>

<p>I know that I speak for our entire district community when I say that we are disappointed by this news, but we also understand that it is necessary in order to keep our community safe and healthy. We miss seeing our students’ smiling faces every day, and we look forward to the day that we are able to return to regular, in-person instruction. Thanks again for your understanding and flexibility during this challenging time.</p>

<p>Dr. Allyn J. Roche<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p><em><strong>4/3/20:</strong></em></p>

<p>Dear UPSD Community - </p>

<p>This week, we embarked on a new journey as a district, and began <a data-page-name="Upper Perkiomen School District At Home Learning" href="/fs/pages/2012">At-Home Learning</a> for all Upper Perk students. I recognize that this is not an ideal teaching or learning environment, but the silver lining is that we are all learning new things together! Thank you to all of our parents, grandparents, siblings and caregivers that have been instantly thrust into a new role and for navigating many new technologies and programs so quickly. I hope everyone had the opportunity to reconnect with the teachers, staff, and other members of the UPSD community this week, and adjust to our “new normal” for the time being. </p>

<p>As we progress with At-Home Learning, our teachers, staff and administrators will continue to fine tune our process to provide the best possible education for our students and strive to find the right balance of school work and activities given the situation. Please continue to communicate with the teachers and principals about any issues or concerns, and feel free to share with them any successes -- we need to celebrate the positive and “sprinkle kindness like confetti” to one another during this unprecedented time!! </p>

<p>Additionally, as we head into the weekend, I wanted to provide a number of updates on other topics.</p>

<p><strong>ALL Grab and Go Meal Distribution at 4th &amp; 5th Grade Center Starting 4/6</strong><br>
Beginning Monday, April 6, 2020, UPSD will be consolidating the Grab and Go Meals Program to only one pick-up location: Upper Perkiomen 4th &amp; 5th Grade Center. This change will enable the district to more efficiently utilize resources and streamline staff needs in coordination with the Governor’s shelter-in-place orders. Pick-ups will continue to take place around the back of the 4th &amp; 5th Grade Center.</p>

<p>For the duration of the program, meal pickups will occur on Mondays and Wednesdays at the 4th &amp; 5th Grade Center, from 11:30am-1pm, unless otherwise communicated. There will be no pickups during scheduled school breaks, including Monday, April 13.</p>

<p>Families are reminded to pre-register for meals as soon as possible, as pre-registrations guarantee that meals will be available, and pre-registrations also help our food services staff to better plan for the distribution events. Pre-registrations MUST be submitted prior to 9 p.m. the night before distribution in order to be guaranteed (before 9 p.m. on Sunday for Monday distribution events and before 9 p.m. on Tuesday for Wednesday distribution events).</p>

<p>The <a data-page-name="2020 School Closure Student Meals" href="/fs/pages/2011">form on the website</a> has been updated for meal distribution events through the month of April, and we are accepting pre-registrations for distribution events on April 6, 8, 15, 20, 22, 27 and 29 at this time. </p>

<p>To date, we have distributed over 500 meal packs to our students. Thanks to everyone who has helped make this program a success, including our wonderful food services staff.</p>

<p><strong>School Calendar &amp; Spring Break</strong><br>
As a reminder, we are committed to honoring our school calendar and the previously scheduled Spring Break. As such, April 9, 10 and 13 are Spring Break vacation days, and there will not be “daily school.” Students are off from At-Home Learning, as if they were off from regular school. Additionally, Wednesday, April 8 is an “early dismissal” day. Teachers will only have one set of office hours in the morning on 4/8, and the afternoon will be dedicated to virtual faculty meetings, department meetings and continued planning for At-Home Learning. </p>

<p>We hope that all UPSD students, families and staff enjoy Spring Break to the best of their abilities, given the current circumstances. Take this opportunity to have a staycation, try a new recipe, be inventive with at-home activities, or just relax and enjoy family time. We know that everyone (students, families, teachers, counselors, support staff and administration) all deserve this well-earned Spring Break!  </p>

<p><strong>Virtual School Board Meetings</strong><br>
As a result of the current closure of school district buildings and stay-at-home orders set forth by Governor Wolf, the Upper Perkiomen School Board has changed the following meetings from in-person meetings, previously scheduled to take place at the Education Center, to virtual meetings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular School Board Meeting - Thursday, April 9, 2020 at 7:00 p.m.</li>
	<li>Facilities Committee Meeting - Thursday, April 16, 2020 at 7:00 p.m.</li>
	<li>Finance Committee Meeting - Monday, April 20, 2020 at 6:30 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other committee meetings for April have been cancelled, and details on May meetings of the Board will be announced at a later date. Information on how to access and participate in virtual meetings will be made available on the district homepage and <a data-page-name="Virtual School Board Meetings" href="/fs/pages/2018">this webpage</a> during the week of April 6.</p>

<p><strong>Schoology Challenges (for grades 6-12)</strong><br>
We know that many students/families have been experiencing difficulty with Schoology (used in grades 6-12). Given the unprecedented, increased demand for at-home learning, the Schoology team recently posted <a href="https://www.schoology.com/blog/scaling-schoology-increased-demand?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTnpZMk1XSTNaak5qTkRFMyIsInQiOiIwUTlnK1hCYXNcLzJzcDc1SmU4c1AwaGppcVFpcFBXWVJaS2xMeGtEY3lzN2l4UHhCTUxKazVDa0hMaTlpNHI0Tkp3WDB1VWh4YjAySjR1Ujk1STF5dXYydXR5QnFvdlRQKzRNUGQzV21wVHlSam11YlwvdWFqUWJabk0rUFh4alZJIn0%3D" target="_blank">updates on the Schoology blog</a> regarding the proactive steps their team is taking to ensure every student continues to have access to the resources they require.</p>

<p><strong>New Information About 2020 AP Exams</strong><br>
To support students in continuing their AP journey, the AP is offering optional free, online AP classes and take-at-home AP Exams. For more information about this year's exam administration, including details about exam dates, times and tasks, visit <a href="https://apcoronavirusupdates.collegeboard.org/?SFMC_cid=EM294654-&amp;rid=47186142" target="_blank">the AP website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Wear Sales</strong><br>
There have been a number of questions raised about the two spirit wear sales that were in progress at the time of the school closure. The elementary PTFS spirit wear order has already been placed. The delivery and pickup of the items is on hold until further notice, pending the lifting/adjustment of school closures and stay-at-home orders. PTFS will be in touch to schedule pickup times at some point in the future. Similarly, a plan for the middle school PTFS spirit wear order is in progress, and will be shared soon.</p>

<p>Thank you again for all of the hard work that took place, both this week and in the weeks leading up to our At-Home Learning kickoff, as well as the work to come as we remain committed to At-Home Learning for the foreseeable future. It is because of the dedication of our teachers, administrators, staff and families that our students may continue to learn and grow, even as they stay home amidst this global pandemic. Seeing that dedication makes me incredibly <strong>#Proud2BeUPSD</strong>, both today and every day. We’ll “see” you all again on Monday, for half a week of At-Home Learning ahead of Spring Break. Until then, have a great weekend.</p>

<p>Dr. Allyn J. Roche <br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p><em><strong>3/30/20:</strong></em></p>

<p>Dear UPSD Community - </p>

<p>I hope you all had a good weekend and that your student was excited to reconnect with their teacher(s) today during our first day of <a data-page-name="Upper Perkiomen School District At Home Learning" href="/fs/pages/2012">At-Home Learning</a>. Thank you for your support and flexibility.  I am so proud of our teachers, counselors, support staff, paraprofessionals and administrators for all their work and planning to prepare for today’s “First Day.” I know we had a few hiccups today, and we will continue to make small adjustments to improve the learning experience for our students while streamlining the supports for our families at home. For example this morning, Schoology, our Learning Management System at the MS and HS, went down for a period of time, and it created many initial concerns. On a positive note, today we were able to connect with a number of families who were in need of a device for their student to complete their schoolwork, and those students are now better-equipped to complete this week's assignments. I am confident we will find our way together, and our students will continue to have the best educational experience possible, given these extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p>This afternoon, Gov. Wolf made a number of <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-and-sec-of-health-expand-stay-at-home-order-to-carbon-cumberland-dauphin-and-schuylkill-counties-extend-school-closures-indefinitely/" target="_blank">announcements related to COVID-19</a>. These announcements included adding four more PA counties to his shelter-in-place order, and extending that order for the 26 affected counties through April 30. Perhaps most noteworthy for our purposes, Gov. Wolf has extended the mandatory school closures indefinitely, with no date set for a return to regular in-person school days. This news means that we will be out of school until at least early May, at best.</p>

<p>While this is not the news we had hoped to hear, it is not surprising, given current events. The good news is that we now have our <a data-page-name="Upper Perkiomen School District At Home Learning" href="/fs/pages/2012">At-Home Learning</a> program in place, and we will continue to work to further refine that program as we move towards our scheduled Spring Break and beyond. Please know that we remain committed to teaching our students to the best of our ability during this challenging time, and we will stay the course with the At-Home Learning model for the foreseeable future, pending another update from Gov. Wolf or major progress in the country’s battle to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued patience and support. Please remember that any questions may be directed to <a href="mailto:questions@upsd.org" target="_blank">questions@upsd.org</a>. Have a safe and healthy week of At-Home Learning!</p>

<p>Dr. Allyn J. Roche<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p><em><strong>3/27/20 - At-Home Learning:</strong></em></p>

<p>Dear UPSD Community,</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the Pennsylvania Department of Education in compliance with Governor Wolf announced that all schools in the Commonwealth will remain closed through April 6th as a result of the COVID-19 response efforts. In our region, the spread of the virus is more pervasive than it is in other parts of the state, so our team, along with many other districts in Montgomery County, are planning for Tuesday, April 14th as the earliest possible opening.</p>

<p>In this message, I want to share our plans for the upcoming two weeks in regard to At-Home Learning. </p>

<p><strong>At-Home Learning Calendar</strong></p>

<p>Students will begin At-Home Learning on Monday, March 30th and continue on a weekday schedule through Wednesday, April 8th – schedules that detail dates later in April will be announced, if necessary, as we get further direction from the Governor. </p>

<p>As our team discussed how to structure the instructional calendar for the next stage of closures, we wanted to provide you a visual schedule of the next several days. As you will see, we will continue to honor the previously scheduled Spring Break, and if there is no extension of the school closure order from Governor Wolf, we will welcome all students back to our buildings on Tuesday, April 14th, 2020. </p>

<p>All learning assignments will be posted to the district website and will be available on Monday mornings. To navigate to the At-Home Learning page, from the district homepage, select Academics on the top bar. Once there, scroll down and select At-Home Learning. Then select the appropriate level: elementary, middle or high school. The learning assignments will be available there at the start of each week. Additionally, a direct link to the At-Home Learning materials will be available on the district homepage, as well as the landing pages for each of our schools. Assignments can be submitted daily; however, are not officially due until Sunday at 11pm. </p>

<p><em><strong>3/27/20 - General Updates:</strong></em></p>

<p>Dear UPSD Community - </p>

<p>On Monday, we embark on a new journey as a district, as we begin At-Home Learning for all Upper Perk students. I hope you’ve had a chance to read the email that came out earlier today with additional details on At-Home Learning, and if you haven’t, please take some time to carefully review it this weekend. While At-Home Learning is not the method of instruction we’d prefer in an ideal world, I’m excited for us to have the opportunity to provide a continuity of education for our students, given the current situation in our country.</p>

<p>Additionally, as we head into the weekend, I wanted to provide a number of updates on other topics.</p>

<p><strong>The Calendar Ahead </strong><br>
As you know, Gov. Wolf extended the closure of all schools across the Commonwealth through at least Monday, April 6, 2020. Based upon our school calendar, and to honor our previously scheduled Spring Break, the earliest our students would return to face-to-face school would be Tuesday, April 14 (pending extended school closures). We are honoring April 9, 10 and 13 as Spring Break days where there will not be “daily school” – students are off from At-Home Learning, as if they were off from regular school! UPSD is committed to At-Home Learning from March 30 through April 13 at the minimum (minus the previously mentioned Spring Break), and if the school closures are extended, we will continue with At-Home Learning.</p>

<p>I’ve received a number of questions about the status of UPHS graduation, prom, Arts Week and other end-of-year traditions and activities. I recognize how meaningful and important these experiences are for our students, especially our seniors. No final decisions have been made regarding most of the traditional year-end activities at this point. This situation is ever-changing, and right now, we need everyone to follow the regulations set forth by the governor to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Hopefully we will get back to daily on-site school as quickly and safely as possible, and if it is realistic to do so, we will do everything we can to preserve end-of-year traditions and activities.</p>

<p>Several individuals have also inquired about the status of the spring sports season. Right now, we are taking our lead from PIAA. The spring sports season is currently postponed. No date has been determined to restart any sports activities at this time. Follow the latest updates on the <a href="https://www.piaa.org/" target="_blank">PIAA website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Spirit Days - March 30 through April 8</strong><br>
I know that we’re asking a lot of families as At-Home Learning begins next week, but I also know that our community members are craving positive ways to connect with one another. As such, we’ll be doing voluntary district-wide virtual spirit days beginning Monday, March 30 and ending on Wednesday, April 8. Take pictures of students’ participation in spirit days and send them to <a href="mailto:ngum@upsd.org" target="_blank">ngum@upsd.org</a> and/or use <strong>#KeepingSpiritsUP</strong> on social media. Check out an outline of the spirit days below.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Monday, March 30 – National Virtual Vacation Day</strong><br>
We can’t go on ACTUAL vacations right now, so it’s the perfect opportunity to take a VIRTUAL trip! Dress like a tourist or wear gear from your favorite vacation spot!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Tuesday, March 31 – Crazy Socks &amp; World Down Syndrome Day (belated)</strong><br>
World Down Syndrome Day was on March 21st, in the midst of the school closure, so let’s recognize it on the 31st - wear crazy socks today!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Wednesday, April 1 - Mismatched Outfit Day &amp; Paraprofessional Appreciation Day</strong><br>
Let’s wear crazy/mismatched clothes for April Fools’ Day and send our paras some love (from a distance).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Thursday, April 2 – World Autism Awareness Day - Wear Blue</strong><br>
Blue is the color for autism awareness, so wear blue or your autism awareness shirts today!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Friday, April 3 - Show Your School Spirit - Wear U.P. Gear</strong><br>
Wear your Upper Perk spirit wear as we head into the weekend.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Wednesday April 8 - We Miss Our Teachers! (and our teachers miss their students)</strong><br>
Dress like your favorite teacher, principal, coach or mentor.</p>

<p><strong>Grab &amp; Go Meals Distribution - March 30, April 1, 6 &amp; 8</strong><br>
Many thanks to our volunteers and staff for assembling and distributing this week's meal packs. The meal distribution events on Monday and Wednesday were great successes, and we loved seeing the smiling faces of students and their families, from a safe distance!</p>

<p>We have planned additional food distribution events for Monday, March 30; Wednesday, April 1; Monday, April 6; and Wednesday, April 8. If you would like to pick up meals for your child(ren) at any of these events, please <a data-page-name="2020 School Closure Student Meals" href="/fs/pages/2011">pre-register on our website</a> as soon as possible, as pre-registrations help our food services staff to better plan for these events. Should the school closure be extended further, we will share information about future food distribution plans at that time.</p>

<p><strong>Ways to Help UPSD During the School Closure - Your Support is Appreciated!</strong><br>
Over the course of this school closure, we’ve received a number of inquiries from community members and businesses asking how they may lend support to our students, especially in regard to our Grab and Go Meal Program. First and foremost, thank you to everyone who has reached out in that regard. Your generosity and genuine concern for Upper Perk students’ well being is heartwarming! </p>

<p>At this time, the district, like many other community organizations, is not able to accept donations of food or other products. This is to ensure the safety of our staff and our students/families. Volunteer opportunities are also very limited in an effort to help contain the spread of COVID-19. </p>

<p>If you would like to help UPSD in a tangible way during this time, providing financial support is the best method to help ensure that we are able to continue to provide meals to our students in need of food.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>If you would like to support the Grab and Go Meal Program, which is available to all students K-12, please make your check payable to the UPSD Cafeteria Account and mail it to the Upper Perkiomen Education Center 2229 East Buck Road Suite 2 Pennsburg, PA 18073. Thank you for your support!</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, we’d like to remind you that community organizations and resources, such as <a href="https://www.theopenlink.org/" target="_blank">The Open Link</a>, are being heavily relied upon during this unprecedented situation. For those who wish to help the students and families of the Upper Perkiomen Valley, providing support to community organizations is crucial during times like these to help ensure that supplies are available to those who need it most.</p>

<p><strong>Reminder About Social Distancing</strong><br>
Please remember that Montgomery County and most surrounding counties are under a stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Wolf. That means that students and their families should remain at home whenever possible, unless leaving to complete essential job functions or to procure goods or services to support their families.</p>

<p>As always, thank you for your support of the Upper Perkiomen School District, our students &amp; families, teachers &amp; staff and the administration as we find our way during these uncertain times. I have witnessed a level of collaboration and support over the past weeks that has blown me away, and makes me especially <strong>#Proud2BeUPSD</strong>. Don’t forget that you may continue to direct questions or comments to <a href="mailto:questions@upsd.org" target="_blank">questions@upsd.org</a>. Have a safe and healthy weekend.</p>

<p>Dr. Allyn J. Roche<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>
