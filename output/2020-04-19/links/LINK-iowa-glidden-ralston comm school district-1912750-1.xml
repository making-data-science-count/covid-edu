I am hoping we can find ways to either delay certain events or create alternatives that will be meaningful for our students. Over the course of the next few days and weeks we will be receiving guidance from the state department of education concerning the plan we need to put in place for the start of the next school year.

<p>COVID-19 Update (4-3-2020 Friday)</p>

<p>As most of you are aware, the governor shut down schools through April 30th yesterday. With this came a couple of options for districts across the state. We have the option to continue learning in a setting in which we take on-line attendance, require work from students, grade the materials returned and give credit for work done or no credit for lack of work completed. Or we can continue voluntary learning by providing learning opportunities for students but not assign grades or credit. We will be choosing the voluntary option as we feel there are too many equity issues in our district to ask students to do required work. That does not mean the work provided will not be worth while as it will all be based upon the standards our students will still be responsible for as GR graduates. We will be developing a plan over the course of the next few days that will be communicated to our patrons. Students will be able to have direct contact with their teachers and we will be providing opportunities for them to continue their learning, knowing that we will still have a lot of recovery work to do in the fall. If we would happen to return on May 1st, then our students will be ready to immediately re-enter the building and build upon what has been provided. By choosing this option we WILL NOT be required to make up these days in the summer. We realize this is going to take a lot of support from our parents in the home and we will be cognizant of that fact in the amount of work we will be sending home.</p>

<p>A few other things to share:</p>

<p>1. All seniors who were on track to graduate will graduate. As a local district we will have the ability to waive certain requirements to insure all of our seniors will graduate.</p>

<p>2. All students will move to the next grade as if they would have completed the entire year traditionally. (Now there may be some at the kindergarten level who would repeat a year if appropriate and agreed upon by teacher and parents, as we have always done). It will become our job, as a district, to find ways when we return or within the next school year(s) to make sure any standards our children missed are included in the next years curriculum. Our teachers are currently working on what that transition plan may look like from grade to grade.</p>

<p>3. Our certified and support staff are still working! Even though they may not be physically present in the building both our teachers and associates are currently and will continue to complete professional development activities in order for all of us to take this time to improve our craft. Teachers will be working on curriculum alignment and development. They will be thoroughly examining their courses and establishing or updating the power standards that go with each course, while at the same time reaching out to their students to provide learning opportunities during this closure. They will also be completing Professional development activities appropriate to their teaching areas. Our associate staff will be taking coursework specifically designed for para-educators in our state and providing support to our teaching staff. </p>

<p>The support we have received from you as parents and patrons of the district has been incredible! If you need resources, please let us know and we will try to help in any way we can. </p>

<p>One change we will be making is in our grab and go lunches. Our kitchen staff has been working diligently to provide these meals but safety is always a concern for them too! It has been recommended that we limit exposure of our employees as much as possible, so we will be changing the pick up of the lunches to two days a week. Every Monday and Wednesday. We do have an option to pick up in Ralston as well. Again, if you need this service please contact Brenda Wittrock at bwittrock@glidden-ralston.k12.ia.us.</p>

<p>I want to thank our custodial staff as well. They have worked through this entire closure to not only deep clean our facility but continue to work on building improvement projects.</p>

<p>Important items of note:<br>
1. All activities have been cancelled through April 30th.<br>
2. Prom has been postponed at this time. <br>
3. All of our playgrounds/ ball fields will be closed until further notice.</p>

<p>We will work to provide continuous communication with our students and parents and try to meet your individual needs the best we can. Please be patient with us, as this is entirely new to all of us. I promise we will do the very best we can for our students and families.</p>

<p>Covid-19 Update- Tuesday, March 24th</p>

<p>I wanted to share some more information with you as we enter week two of our schools being closed. First, we have had a generous donation from our local Masonic Lodge and this is going to allow us to provide our grab and go lunch program for FREE. This includes all ages of kids up to the age of 18. Please just email Brenda Wittrock at bwittrock@glidden-ralston.k12.ia.us and let her know how many lunches you will need. To reduce any exposure opportunities we will be changing our format to make 2 lunches to give you on Monday, Wednesday and provide a lunch for Friday from 11:30 to 12:30. This means no service on Tuesday and Thursday. Each Monday and Wednesday we will pack enough food for two days of lunches and provide another on Friday.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have created Google sites for our students to access on our webpage. These will be up and running in the next couple of days. Just follow the link to the appropriate grade levels and our teachers will be posting activities for our students. This is a good way for our students to stay engaged in educational activities.</p>

<p>Lastly, we are trying to keep our district calendar as up to date as possible. We will be updating that calendar regularly. If you are wondering about postponements or cancellations please consult that calendar on our website.</p>

<p>Please have your child check their email daily to see if the school has shared any correspondence with them.</p>

<p>These are the times when I am so thankful to work in a district that comes together and supports kids and families at all times! Thanks for everything you are doing to support the school district.</p>

<p>Covid-19 update- Thursday March 19th</p>

<p>First I want to thank all of our district patrons for the support and understanding they have given the school district during this time.  We are working hard to communicate as much as we possibly can the information that we have.  Please understand that the guidance we get from both the Iowa Department of Education and the Iowa Department of Health comes at the end of each day as they have the difficult task of trying to find the answers to the many questions school districts are posing.</p>

<p>One of the major decisions that came out in the last couple of days is the waving of the missed school hours and missed school days.  At this time, we do not have any intentions of adding this time to the end of our school year.  I think this is an event that calls for us to look at the instruction we deliver upon returning to school and in the following school year and make sure we are ensuring that all kids are delivered instruction in the standards required by the state.</p>

<p>I have received many questions concerning online learning options.  The Department of Education has been very clear in that we cannot require students to participate even if we offered it as it would not be equally available to all students.  There are so many issues when it comes to availability of technology, internet access,and bandwidth that we just don't have the capacity to solve at this time.</p>

<p>Finally,  I want to reassure our students that we will get them back on track as soon as possible and try to preserve as many of the extra-curricular opportunities and events as we are allowed once it is deemed as safe and wise to do so.</p>
