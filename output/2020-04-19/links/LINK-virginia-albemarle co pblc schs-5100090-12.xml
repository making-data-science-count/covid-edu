<p><img src="/newspix/WINARadioWeb.png" alt="Dr. Haas WINA Interview">ACPS Superintendent Dr. Matt Haas recently had the opportunity to talk with WINA’s Les Sinclair, who asked excellent questions about how the current school closure might affect future events in the division, including whether students will have to redo their current school year (they won’t) if schools remain closed through June. Several important topics that have been on the minds of many of you these past few days were covered in their conversation.</p>

<p><img src="/newspix/StudentLearningSupportWeb.png" alt="Student Learning Support">Among our priorities during this school closure is to be as supportive as possible of all students while they are at home. We’d like to adapt one of our most successful programs, Check and Connect, to our work with students beginning this week. In the Check and Connect program, academic coaches stay in touch with students on a regular basis. They provide advice and encouragement to students in the program to help meet a child’s academic and personal development needs. We are now expanding this program to include all students.</p>

<h4>Community Speaker Series Thursday Focus on Teaching Hard History</h4>
<p><img src="/newspix/Montpelier.jpg" alt="Montpelier">This Thursday, as part of our continuing Community Speaker Series, one of our nation’s leading scholars and authors from the Civil Rights Era, Dr. Hasan Kwame Jeffries, will be in Charlottesville.  Dr. Jeffries is a powerful advocate for justice for people of all races through his writings, television appearances and social media podcasts.  All are invited to join Dr. Jeffries for an extended conversation on why the teaching of what has been called hard history is so valuable to the social, emotional and professional development of our students and communities. This one-hour discussion begins at 4:30 and is being held in the African American Heritage Center at the Jefferson School in Charlottesville.  The program is funded in part by Montpelier and the Charlottesville Albemarle Community Foundation.</p>

<p><img src="/newspix/CaleEntrance.jpg" alt="Cale Elementary School">Superintendent Haas has recommended to the School Board that the name of Cale Elementary School be changed.  The Superintendent’s action is consistent with the recommendation of a citizens advisory committee that represented the Cale school community.  “While we cannot know all that was in the hearts and minds of our school division leaders more than 60 years ago, we do know those leaders served during a period of time in our history that was unequivocally racist.  While it was a time that should always be remembered, it is not a time to be celebrated,” Dr. Haas said.</p>

<p><img src="/newspix/MattAddressesTeachers.jpg" alt="Dr. Matt Haas">In a sweeping call to action, Albemarle County Public Schools Superintendent, Dr. Matthew Haas, told the division’s nearly 1,400 teachers that priorities this year include establishing multiple career pathways at each high school and student center; engaging the community in conversations on modernizing a “broken grading system”; bringing principals together to develop strategies and practices that will improve student performance on such measures as the state’s Standards of Learning (SOL) tests; and a new approach that will reduce out-of-school suspensions of middle schools students.</p>
