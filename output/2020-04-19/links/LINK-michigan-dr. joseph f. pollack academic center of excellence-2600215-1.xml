<p style="font-weight: 400;">To<span>Â </span>the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings on a snowy mid-April Friday. Iâm not sure what happened to spring, but I know many of you join me in not welcoming the cold and the sight of the white stuff this time of year!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I hope many of you are able to enjoy some respite in the weekend ahead. It is a good time to get away, emotionally, and decompress from the stress and challenges in the world around us. A mental health expert interviewed on WEMU this week emphasized the need to focus on simple things â such as sleeping, walking, laughing, eating healthy, practicing mindfulness and taking deep breaths. Finding diversions from the 24-hour news cycle is important â as is staying connected with family and friends through all the various online social sharing platforms. Most of all, continue to stay home and stay safe.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have several good news items to share as we wrap up the week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EMU CARES Grant expanded to graduate students</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am very pleased to announce that we have expanded the EMU CARES Grant for students affected by the COVID-19 crisis to include graduate students. The EMU CARES Grant was introduced last week, initially for undergraduate students while the University assessed the most effective way to support graduate students. After that assessment, we determined that graduate students would benefit from the grant under the same terms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The one-time grant provides $500 to all students, undergraduate and graduate, enrolling in three credit hours, and $1,000 for all students, undergraduate and graduate, enrolling in six credit hours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The grant is designed to offset new costs and other hurdles students face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the additional expenses associated with online and hybrid courses.<span>Â </span>It provides an additional benefit to students to help them persist in their education and complete their degrees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our graduate students face layoffs and other financial hardships and we want to support them, as well as our undergraduate students, as they navigate these unprecedented challenges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">No application is required to obtain an EMU CARES Grant.<span>Â </span>It will be automatically credited to studentsâ accounts for eligible summer 2020 courses. If you have already registered, the grant will be reflected in a future ebill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Because the grant is designed to offset additional online fees students must pay due to COVID-19, the grant<span>Â </span>is available to students who take courses in which an online fee is charged -- this includes the majority of summer courses. The grant aims directly to address concerns raised by some students about being required to take an online course because of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A few important qualifications should be noted. Students who receive full-tuition scholarships for their summer classes and international students may not be eligible for the EMU CARES Grant. Students may e-mail<span>Â </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0366616a6f6f43666e6a606b2d666776"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3b5e595257577b5e56525853155e5f4e">[emailÂ protected]</span></a><span>Â </span>if they have questions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Summer registration is currently underway, with more than 650 courses to choose from. Classes begin May 4. Students can visit the<span>Â </span><a href="/online/index.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/online/index.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587251833661000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8mw2V3z1pjxiAKk9MapnMQTTy8w">Universityâs online enrollment page</a><span>Â </span>to learn more about the Universityâs extensive online<span>Â </span>and transferable summer course offerings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Renewal conditions relaxed for 2020-2021 student scholarships</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some students have expressed concern that the changes in the delivery of instruction and housing status due to the COVID-19 global pandemic may impact their ability to meet the GPA requirements for EMU<span>Â </span><span>scholarship</span><span>Â </span>renewal. I am pleased to announce that<span>Â </span><strong>all<span>Â </span><span>scholarships</span><span>Â </span>listed below will automatically be renewed</strong><span>Â </span>for the 2020-2021 aid year if students meet other<span>Â </span><span>scholarship</span><span>Â </span>conditions such as their remaining semesters of eligibility, enrollment requirements for the 2020-2021 aid year, and Federal Satisfactory Academic<span>Â </span>Progress (SAP):<br><br></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update to pass/fail reporting requirements</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Provostâs office yesterday distributed a helpful update to students about the Universityâs Winter 2020 Pass-Fail Grade Reporting Options. Details are included in this link:Â <span><a title="Go to Provost's Update on Pass-Fail" href="/academic-student-affairs/provosts-office/wednesday-briefings/2020/04-16.php">Provost's Update to Students</a></span>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COVID-19 international students survey</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span></span><span>A survey has been designed specifically for our international students to request feedback on their experiences at Eastern during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Provostâs Office and the Office for International Students and Scholars (OISS) will review the information to determine the best ways to continue our support of international students during this difficult time. We ask international students to please check their email in order to access and complete the survey by April 24, 2020.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Campus hotspots identified, coordination with other universities</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide students throughout the region with free access to WiFi, Eastern Michigan has joined with other area universities to establish a network of on campus outdoor hotspots where people can access WiFi from inside their vehicles. An Eastern hotspot is located at the Convocation Center, Parking Lot<span>Â </span>B. The strongest signal can be found nearest the entrance of the Convocation Center. Hotspot access is available from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. and users should remain in their vehicles when using the hotspot due to physical distancing guidance. Other University parking lots are being evaluated for hotspot/WiFi access. We will provide further details as these are determined.<span><span>Â </span></span><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eastern is participating in a regional hotspot project with other universities to assist students across the area with hotspot/WiFi access. Students from Eastern or any of the participating institutions can access hotspots at participating institutions. Complete details about how to access Easternâs hotspot, as well as the location of hotspots at other participating<span>Â </span>universities, can be found on the<span>Â </span><a href="/it/network/parkinglotwifi.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/it/network/parkinglotwifi.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587251833662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMGrfiy_WR21bjtMVS-paOhu8X3g">Information Technology hotspot link</a>.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Looking ahead</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you know, we truly value the inspiring stories emerging among our students, faculty, staff and community volunteers. I like to capture highlights of these efforts in our messages, and today I have a wonderful and profound message to share about the work of a faculty member and her engagement with our students. It seems a fitting way to close out the week â with a strong reminder of why we all do what we do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Beth Henschen, associate professor of political science, sent this message to us:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I applaud my faculty colleagues for the creative ways in which they have connected with their classes during this pandemic as well as their remarkable dedication to continuing to âteach well.â Iâd like to say a few words about the students...</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>I was fortunate to be the recipient of a Faculty Research Fellowship (FRF) for the winter 2020 semester. My research âteam,â a graduate assistant and an undergraduate funded by the fellowship, have continued to work diligently. Electronic conversations replaced our regular in-person meetings and our methods for coding data were adapted to an online format. Through it all, they have cheerfully continued to work, thanking me when I send them another set of items to code. A work-study student in the department asked if I had any projects for her to undertake, even though she would continue to be paid for the remainder of the semester whether she logged any hours or not. I offered her a contained data-gathering task. She thanked me for giving her something interesting to do, for bringing a bit more focus to her days, and completed the assignment in record time.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>My point is this: These students have had their lives upended. Symposium presentations that have gone undelivered, honors events that have not taken place, send-offs to law school put on hold, graduate student receptions cancelled. Yet through it all, these studentsâour studentsâhave shown grit and grace and good humor. Letâs applaud them.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for sharing this poignant message with us, Dr. Henschen.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To<span>Â </span>the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Students have expressed considerable interest in the EMU CARES Grant, a one-time grant initiative to support registration for undergraduate students in 2020 summer online/virtual classes, which was announced in an<span>Â </span><a href="/coronavirus/documents/emu-cares-email.pdf?v=2020-04-13T17:56:06Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/documents/emu-cares-email.pdf?v%3D2020-04-13T17:56:06Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586983646757000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJGbJRXtqqqed4o40SvZeXyiMZhQ">email to students last Thursday (4/9)</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Grant provides a $500 grant for students enrolling in one class/three credits and $1,000 for students enrolling in two classes/six credits.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the positive comments we have received include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âThanks so much, I have already enrolled, and was considering dropping the class, but this will really help me and I can stay enrolled :)â</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âThank you very much. This will help tremendously since my husband lost his job due to COVID-19.â</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><br>The grant program was established to<span>Â </span>address the serious disruption in studentsâ pursuit of their degrees.<span>Â </span>We understand<span>Â </span>the profound impact the global health crisis is having on everyone, particularly the financial hardship on students and their families. We are committed to doing everything we can to help students persist in their education and complete their degrees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new EMU CARES Grant directly addresses concerns raised by some students about the online fees for summer courses, which total $240 for a three-credit class. In fact, the CARES grant not only covers the online fee, but also provides students with an additional financial benefit. With the new grant, students will benefit with an additional $260 ($500 grant minus $240 online fee) for those taking three credits. Students taking six credits will receive an additional $520 ($1,000 grant minus $480 online course fees).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The CARES grant was designed to m</span>aximize a student's ability to qualify for financial aid because the CARES grant is specifically excluded from a student's financial aid award calculation. Removing the online fee does not accomplish this goal and may, in fact, negatively impact a student's financial aid award calculation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As you might expect with a grant offering of this nature we received several questions, which I will answer below:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What do I have to do to apply for the EMU CARES Grant?<br></strong>A: There is no application process. The grant is automatically credited to your account upon registration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong style="font-size: inherit;">Q: What if I have already registered, do I still qualify?<br></strong>A: Yes. The credit will be reflected in a future ebill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Why isnât this particular grant offered for graduate students?<br></strong>A: We greatly value our graduate students and are evaluating the best way to support them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Why do students have to pay online course fees for summer classes now that we are required to take these courses online?<br></strong>A: The online course fee is an existing fee that has been in place and supports the additional technology, software and design support required to offer these course sections on an ongoing basis. As outlined above, however, the CARES grant is designed to address this concern in a way that does not negatively impact studentsâ financial aid eligibility.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Will I receive the CARES grant if I take a one- or two-credit summer course?<br></strong>A: Yes. The grant will be pro-rated based on the number of credits taken. For example, a student taking a one-credit course will receive a CARES grant of $166, and a student taking a two-credit course will receive a CARES grant of $333. The maximum allowable grant is $1,000 for undergraduate students taking six or more credits this summer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Join us in celebrating our 2020 graduates</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As I indicated last week, we are finalizing plans for an online/virtual celebration for our more than 2,200 soon-to-be new graduates in advance of an in-person Commencement ceremony that will occur this fall (we hope to announce the date soon). Weâve had a great response to our request for âselfie videosâ congratulating the class of 2020. Itâs not too late -- all students, faculty, staff and alumni are invited to send us a video to be included in the celebration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Even though we are apart -- learning, teaching and working remotely -- we can come together virtually to cheer on our graduates and acknowledge all they have achieved.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline for video submissions is Saturday, April 18.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please send your video to<span>Â </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#65021704013a575557552500080c060d4b000110"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3f584d5e5b600d0f0d0f7f5a52565c57115a5b4a">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>. In your email, please include your name and your connection to the EMU community (graduation year if alumni, faculty/staff title, student standing, community member, etc.).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Suggestions for making the video:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Be enthusiastic!</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Be dynamic and active in your presentation.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Be concise.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Hold camera vertical - selfie angle.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Wear EMU gear.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Record selfie message in a controlled environment to limit background noise.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Do not record with a large window in the background to avoid being backlit.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Have fun!</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Â <br></span>I encourage everyone to participate, have fun and be creative, as we start to celebrate our 2020 EMU graduates in a memorable way.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>It is with great sadness that I share news about the death of Marilyn Horace-Moore, a longtime and distinguished instructor and advisor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Criminology.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Marilyn earned a masterâs degree in criminology from EMU in 1989 and a bachelorâs degree in 1978, and has been teaching criminology and sociology courses at Eastern since 1994. Prior to becoming a lecturer and advisor in the department, she enjoyed a successful tenure with the City of Ypsilanti Police Department, retiring as a police lieutenant in 1994. Her research issues have included race, discrimination issues and career advising. She has worked with students at Fast Track and athletic recruiting, and actively supported Commencement activities.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Surviving Marilyn are her husband, two children and 11 grandchildren. Our heartfelt thoughts are with her family, friends, students and University colleagues. We will provide memorial details when they become available.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Todayâs message begins with an important request.<span>Â </span><strong>H</strong><strong>elp us celebrate the EMU Class of 2020</strong>!Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted in Mondayâs message, our graduating students are among the most affected by the disruption to the academic year -- their celebration plans for Commencement were put on hold due to the global health crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>To be sure, our graduates will have the opportunity to participate in a formal Commencement ceremony at a date to be determined.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Until that moment, when our graduating students get to don their cap and gown and walk across the Convocation stage in person, we plan to do a few special things to celebrate their achievements and let them know proud we are to have them as graduates of Eastern Michigan University.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As I indicated Monday, we are finalizing plans for an online/virtual celebration for our more than 2,200 new graduates.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You can play a part in one important element of the celebration. The University is assembling a âselfieâ video montage of congratulatory messages to our graduating students. We are hoping current students, faculty, staff and alumni will take part.<span>Â </span>Even though we are apart -- learning, teaching and working remotely -- we can come together virtually to cheer on our graduates and acknowledge all they have achieved.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I invite you to send us a short âselfieâ<span>Â </span><span>video</span><span>Â </span>offering congratulations to our 2020 graduates.</strong><span>Â </span>The<span>Â </span><span>video</span><span>Â </span>should be between 5-15 seconds. If you are at a loss for words, here are some suggestions below:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>"Congratulations class of 2020!"</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>"Congrats Eagle grads!"</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>"Cheers to the class of 2020!"</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>"Best of luck and happiest wishes to the class of 2020!"</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline for video submissions is Wednesday, April 15.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Please send your video to<span>Â </span></strong><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cdaabfaca992fffdfffd8da8a0a4aea5e3a8a9b8"><span><strong><span><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="96f1e4f7f2c9a4a6a4a6d6f3fbfff5feb8f3f2e3">[emailÂ protected]</span></span></strong></span></a><strong>. In your email, please include your name and your connection to the EMU community (graduation year if alumni, faculty/staff title, student standing, community member, etc.).</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Suggestions for making the video:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Be enthusiastic!</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Be dynamic and active in your presentation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Be concise</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Hold camera vertical - selfie angle</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Wear EMU gear</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Record selfie message in a controlled environment to limit background noise</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Do not record with a large window in the background</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Have fun!</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I encourage everyone to participate, have fun and be creative, as we start to celebrate our 2020 EMU graduates in a memorable way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have several additional updates to share with you today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remote answering of office telephones<br></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that offices answer incoming calls from people seeking information from University offices. Callers, particularly those with important or urgent needs, want to connect with people and donât like being stuck in voicemail. Thanks to the Division of Information Technology (IT), software exists to allow office phones to connect with an employeeâs remote work place and we encourage offices to use this technology.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Employees working remotely may request access to install and use the Cisco "Jabber" softphone (software phone) client. A softphone is software that runs on your computer and connects to the EMU VoIP phone system. Requirements to use a softphone:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>You must be connected to the EMU VPN to use the Jabber Softphone.</li>

<li>You must have a computer equipped with a microphone and speakers or a headset with a microphone to use this software.</li>
<li><strong>You agree that you have a cell phone or a landline available in the location you will be using the softphone. You agree that 911 calls from remote locations must be placed using your cell phone or landline to provide accurate location data to emergency responders.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><br>Once we configure your access, Jabber Installation instructions are found at<span>Â </span><a href="https://tiny.emich.edu/jabberinstructions" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tiny.emich.edu/jabberinstructions&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586472829077000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMvP-9CpII8dpktheGL1Qvx0XjyQ">https://tiny.emich.edu/jabberinstructions</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Please note:Â  Requests from departments prioritized by the Executive Council are completed first.Â  Requests from other departments will be completed when time<span>Â </span></strong><strong>permits.<br></strong></p>

<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Some of our outstanding EMU alumni haveÂ spent the last two weeks making and donating masks to local hospitals and medical professionals. Anne Houston Chapman (BME02), band teacher at Summit Academy in Romulus, has made over 200 masks, going through three sewing machines to create them. Another alumni,Â Lynn Klammer (MS88), helped her friend start The Mid-Michigan Mask Makers (4M) and in just one short week has donated over 1,000 masks to hospitals and other health professionals. The new group hasÂ 130+<span>Â </span>volunteers.Â Learn more about 4M and how you can get involved by visiting the<span>Â </span><span><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/203671260967240" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/203671260967240&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586472829077000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwYnB0C8uX0mxtSj7MyHQtzkKkNQ">Facebook Page</a>.</span></span>Â </li></ul>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>EMU professors Cathy Fleischer and Ann Blakeslee have worked to extend the YpsiWrites resources to the community via an online initiative since people are unable to physically utilize those services at Ypsilanti district libraries. The team has<span>Â </span>created and curated sources to help children, teens, and adults with writing invitations that they can do at home -- individually or together as a family. They are being rolled out on the<span>Â </span><a href="/ccw/ypsi-writes/index.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/ccw/ypsi-writes/index.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586472829077000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTbTjwUyoi6qvg8a5qmsuU8Eow-Q"><span>YpsiWrites website</span></a><span>Â </span>and through the YpsiWrites Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.</li></ul>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today marks the beginning of our fourth week of online/virtual class instruction -- it also marks three weeks away from the end of the winter semester. The level of understanding and acceptance among our students, faculty and staff to the adaptations we have been forced to implement continues to be a source of great gratitude, pride and admiration for all of us.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commencement and graduation celebrations for current seniors</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps nowhere are the effects of the pandemic as impactful as they are to our seniors, who were anticipating the traditional celebration to mark the milestone of the attainment of their degrees. Commencement day is the most special day on a university campus, and I, along with our faculty, University leadership, staff and the Alumni Office, were so looking forward to celebrating this day with our students and their families and loved ones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We announced previously, with sadness, that Commencement activities would be postponed due to the health crisis. Postponed is the appropriate term. Graduating seniors will still have a celebration. University leadership is working on some creative solutions to mark April 25, which was to be Commencement day, in an appropriate but responsible way given the public health guidance limiting public interaction. We will have more to share once the plans are finalized, which is expected in the next week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, the University is committing to our graduating studentsâ participation in a full public Commencement ceremony once it is safe to do so, whether later this fall or in tandem with the Universityâs Fall Commencement ceremony. These plans also are being finalized with plans to be announced soon.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors, we know this time is important to you. It is important to us as well. We will make sure you have the celebration you deserve!<span>Â </span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Although most EMU employees continue to work remotely, a few, who have been designated as âcritical infrastructure workers,â are still coming to campus.<span>Â <span>Â </span></span>As a reminder for these employees and their supervisors, the<span>Â </span><span>Washtenaw</span><span>Â </span>County Health Department emergency order dated March 26, 2020 is currently in place until April 13, 2020.<span>Â </span><strong>That order requires EMU employees to answer screening questions each time they report to work on campus (or before reporting to campus for work).</strong><span>Â </span>Some supervisors have chosen to use a paper form for employees to answer the questions. Others are using the Google Form that has been made available. Supervisors and employees should coordinate regarding which form should be used. As a reminder, if any EMU employee answers "yes" to any of the screening questions, that employee may not work on campus. Further information regarding the Order is available on<span>Â </span><span>EMU's</span><span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 website and the<span>Â </span><span>Washtenaw</span><span>Â </span>County Health Department website.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">As we continue to adapt to the remote working environment, the Division of Information Technology (IT) continues to work to share and support technology resources.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Given the questions and concerns that you may have observed in national media about the use of the video conferencing platform Zoom, the IT page also includes security tips for using Zoom effectively and securely.

Sean Woolf, associate director of the EMU Office of<span>Â </span></span><span>Wellness and Community Responsibility, is helping coordinate these efforts.

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creative approaches to virtual class delivery</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>We continue to learn about Eastern faculty members who are implementing creative approaches to engage their students in our virtual/online world. Professor Linda<span>Â </span><span>Kinczkowski</span><span>Â </span>shared with us how she adjusted her three classes in the Simulation, Animation and Gaming program. Considering they were design classes, being able to see and interact with students was imperative. While she misses the personal approach of in-person classes, she has used CANVAS and ZOOM to continue course delivery and meet with students, seeing their continued project work and hearing their reports on each assignment. Professor<span>Â </span><span>Kinczkowski</span><span>Â </span>indicates that during these meetings she reassures students that âwe will get through this togetherâ while also allowing the opportunity for a few laughs, which she says helps lighten some of the challenges faced by students during the health crisis.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As we head into the weekend, I want to again acknowledge the outstanding collaboration we continue to see from across the University. In these challenging times, our Eastern community is working tirelessly and creatively to support one another and our students.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have several updates to share with you today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Support of health/medical professionals at IHA and St. Joeâs</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the Universityâs ongoing support of our community and our health partners, Eastern will assist IHA and St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor Hospital physicians, nurses and health professionals by providing temporary living arrangements in the Village Apartments. This helps to address a major issue for St. Joeâs and IHA -- helping provide a nearby apartment living space for their professionals who are working long hours in the face of this crisis and need a place to self-isolate. These professionals will occupy a single building in the Villages complex â students will not be housed in the same building. The use of Village Apartments for this purpose begins next week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Students living on campus</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The number of students living on campus is now less than 400. We expect that number to continue to decline slightly in the days ahead. Students remaining on campus include international students â some who are not being allowed to enter their home countries due to the crisis, as well as students from long distances away, students who consider Eastern their permanent address, and those who are unable to return to their permanent address for other reasons, such as someone in their home being at high risk for COVID-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As this transition continues, we remain 100 percent committed to supporting students who are still living on campus. Students with questions about their on-campus housing or the move-out process should email<span>Â </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c28aadb7b1abaca582a7afaba1aaeca7a6b7"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6e06011b1d0700092e0b03070d06400b0a1b">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">As one of many steps the University is taking to support students in completing their degrees amid the health crisis and the disruption it has created, students<span>Â </span>currently registered for the Winter 2020<span>Â </span>semester<span>Â </span>will now be able to register for Summer and Fall semesters with up to a $500 account balance.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">âYour love and commitment to your job, but more importantly, to the people that you serve every day in the healthcare setting is an amazing and admirable trait.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Strength. Character. Resilience. These terms capture the sentiments I observe each day in communications with others on campus about the adjustments made by Eastern Michigan University students, by our faculty and by our staff. Each of us is adjusting rapidly to the turmoil and health crisis that surrounds us, which is affecting every area of our lives. I applaud the Eastern Michigan community for your perseverance, patience and support of one another during this difficult time. This is truly a mark of distinction and something of which we all should be very proud.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have several updates to share today as the University continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Campus housing</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We currently have fewer than 500 students who have not checked out of campus housing at this time. The number is expected to further decline in the days ahead. This has been an extremely important process as the University follows government and public health directives for physical and social distancing. We know that the actual number of students currently living on campus is likely less than the number referenced above -- including students who returned to their permanent addresses but have not formally moved out.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The students remaining on campus include international students â some who are not being allowed to enter their home countries due to the crisis, as well as students from long distances away, students who consider Eastern their permanent address, and those who are unable to return to their permanent address for other reasons, such as someone in their home being at high risk for COVID-19. As this transition continues, we remain 100 percent committed to supporting students who are still living on campus. Students with questions about their on-campus housing or the move-out process should email<span>Â </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#41092e3432282f2601242c2822296f242534"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ff97908a8c969198bf9a92969c97d19a9b8a">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Registering for summer and fall classes</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Processes for summer and fall registration remain underway. Students interested in fall registration should visit the<span>Â </span><a href="/registrar/calendars/fall-2020/appointments.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/registrar/calendars/fall-2020/appointments.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585869118580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4tRJ5A6C6dc3KLoUTh8cKna8f0g">fall registration appointment page</a><span>Â </span>for details.

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Psychology Department chatbot provides additional support for students</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The EMU<span>Â </span><span>Psychology</span><span>Â </span>Department, in collaboration withÂ <span>X2ai.com</span>,Â is conducting a research study that will provide all EMU students free access to a mental health chatbot during the COVID-19 crisis.

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cleaning and disinfecting</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The deep and thorough cleaning and disinfecting of campus areas remains a priority and is ongoing. This process will continue through the spring and summer and is being conducted by our facilities team and external specialists as necessary.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Building access via card swipe for critical infrastructure employees only</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A reminder that only employees designated as critical infrastructure workers or those conducting minimum basic operations are permitted on campus at this time, under the Governorâs âStay Home, Stay Safeâ Executive Order. Employees designated to work on campus should have received a letter from their supervisor stating this, and are the only EMU employees who have swipe card access to their buildings. All others do not have such access. Any employee seeking one-time or temporary access must have consent from their supervisor and divisional vice president. The Department of Public Safety requests that anyone visiting campus buildings contact them so they are aware of the building entry and can ensure appropriate cleaning of those areas by our facilities team.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update for employees working remotely</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Employees working remotely will continue to do so until further notice.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have several important updates for you today as the Universityâs continues its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a very important deadline for students living on campus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deadline for residence hall/ on-campus apartments move-out</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow is the deadline for students to move out of their residence halls or on-campus apartments. As stated in several previous messages, to be eligible for the housing and/or dining credit all personal items must be removed from on-campus housing and formal checkout and keys must be returned no later than tomorrow, March 31 at 5 p.m.<span>Â </span><strong>Students will not receive a credit if they have not removed their belongings and completed the formal checkout process/key return by that date and time.</strong><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A few students and parents have asked if coming to campus would violate the Governorâs âStay Home, Stay Safeâ executive order. The Governorâs executive order does allows travel for such purposes, as noted in Section<span>Â </span><span>7(b) of the order:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Individuals may also travel:<br>(1) To return to a home or place of residence from outside this state.<br>(2) To leave this state for a home or residence elsewhere.<br>(3) To travel between two residences in this state.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Students moving their belongings from campus to their permanent residence fall within the above exceptions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that for some Eastern is a permanent address, or a destination for international students and students from far away in the U.S. Other students have other special circumstances that affect their ability to return to their permanent place of residence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Please contact the<span>Â </span><a href="http://housing@emich.edu/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://housing@emich.edu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585694838237000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1sgLAaD5AZgJwHZClgRUL883pkg">housing office</a><span>Â </span>if you have questions about this process</strong>.<span>Â </span>As indicated previously, students who remain in campus housing may be asked<span>Â </span>to change rooms or consolidate based on total occupancy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update for employees working remotely</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Employees working remotely will continue to do so until communicated otherwise</strong>.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Several offices and individuals across the University have been contacted by hospitals and other healthcare organizations with requests for donations, supplies and volunteers.

This has led to different offices and individuals working to fulfill the same requests as other colleagues on campus.

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>WeÂ </span><span><span>have made it a priority to update our campus community regularly as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold. Given the growing number of casesÂ </span><span>both in the county and statewide</span><span>, the Washtenaw County Health Department (WCHD) no longer issues public announcements about individual cases. The majority of our student body and employees have not been on campus since Wednesday, March 11, more than two-and-a-half weeks ago. Given that time lapse, it is no longer likely that students or employees who test positive would haveÂ </span><span>had close contactÂ </span><span>with others on campus.Â </span><span>Additionally, this time frame is beyond the period of exposure. Anyone who has had close contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 during the period of high risk would be contacted and provided directions by the Health Department typically between 36 and 48 hours after receiving test results. Moving forward,Â </span><span>the University will no longer issue announcements about individual cases, unlessÂ </span><span>circumstances warrant.Â </span><span>Due toÂ </span><span>federal privacy laws, no personal details or further information about individuals who test positive is permitted to be released. The health department has an established protocol to track close contacts of any individual who tests positive andÂ </span><span>will notify anyone who may be at risk.</span></span><span>.<span>Â </span></span><span>Â </span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p>Late yesterday, we received the unfortunate news that an EMU instructor has tested positive for<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19. According to the health department, the instructorâs last day on campus was March 16 and they did not develop symptoms until March 19. Eastern last held in person classes on March 11 before moving to online class operations as a result of the health crisis.</p>
<p>The health department is following its protocol of tracking close contacts of the instructor. Those individuals will be contacted separately and advised by the health department to self-quarantine or take other actions, if necessary.</p>
<p>Due to federal privacy laws, no personal details or further information about the instructor is being released. We have been, and continue to be, in very close and regular contact with public health officials at the County and State.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and support are with the instructor and their family at this time.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today you may have heard Governor Whitmer confirm that it is unlikely Michigan K-12 students will return to the classroom this school year. While summer registration at Eastern Michigan formally begins Monday (3/30) for Honors students, the University is looking closely at the summer schedule in terms of maximizing the online class delivery model we are currently using. We will have more to share about that in the days ahead as we work out the details with our faculty leadership.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 3,600 COVID-19 cases and 92 deaths in Michigan as of this morning, it is becoming increasingly clear that the duration of our health crisis may extend for some time and we need to prepare, as uncertain as it may be at this time.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic is causing extreme stress on our stateâs hospitals and health care system. The health care workers and first responders who continue to work extraordinarily long hours and under highly stressful circumstances deserve our support and praise. They are our heroes in this crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So too are the individuals who are supporting others in our community: students, faculty and staff who are volunteering to collect food, medical supplies, and those who are delivering these items to the places, and the people, in need.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I continue to see great collaboration among the Eastern community throughout this challenging period. I am particularly grateful to the leadership of our faculty and labor partners across the University. They have expressed their unity, support and ideas every step of the way. We would not be able to get through this effectively without that level of collaboration and commitment to our students and institution. This unity and shared effort represents the very best we can be as a University, serving and supporting one another and our students.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I know all of you join me in trying to stay positive as we confront this crisis. At times it may not be easy. But it is more important than ever to search for and embrace those things that give us solace, hope, peace and happiness. As we head into the weekend, it is a good time to think about how we can mentally get away. How we can recharge. The massive effort over the past two weeks to transition to online classes did not come without a lot of anxiety and stress â for our students, our faculty and our staff.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Practice self-care. Search for moments of peace. Find creative outlets for positive energy. It may be reading, taking a walk or a hike and enjoying nature, meditating, or even putting on that energizing Zumba home workout video! Binge watch a program. Listen to music. And how about this? Donât check your email or phone messages for an hour or two. Whatever you do, find a break from the turmoil, even if just briefly. Take care of yourself!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As we wrap up the week, I have a couple of updates as well as some reminders for students about campus resources to support your online/virtual learning.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of eligibility for Temporary EMU COVID-19 Leave</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The 80-hour Temporary EMU COVID-19 Leave for full-time, benefits eligible employees continues to be available through Monday, April 13, 2020.Â  Due to the Washtenaw County Health Department's Order dated March 25, 2020, which requires University employees to answer certain screening questions before working on campus, EMU employees may not be permitted to work because of their answers to the questions.Â  EMU employees who are sent home because of their answers to the screening questions are permitted to use the Temporary EMU COVID-19 Leave for this reason.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update to operations of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Counseling support has been transitioned to fully phone and video sessions with Zoom. If students have questions or need to speak with a counselor, they should email CAPS at<span>Â </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d6e6278637e686164636a237e687f7b646e687e4d6860646e6523686978"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="066569736875636a6f686128756374706f65637546636b6f656e28636273">[emailÂ protected]</span></a><span>Â </span>and communicate their interest. Phone messages can be left at 734.487.1118 and will be returned as soon as possible. CAPS will also continue to offer after-hours (after 5 p.m. and on weekends) phone support through its main CAPS phone line, 734.487.1118.Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Important March 31 deadline reminder for students living in residence halls<br></span></strong></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supporting our Asian American community</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There have been ongoing reports nationally of COVID-19 related racism and discrimination targeting the Asian American community. As we stated in one of our initial messages about the crisis: It is not an illness associated with contact with Asian community members. The Washtenaw County Health Department states, âLetâs fight this public health concern with compassion and science, not fear and discrimination.â As we proudly say here at EMU, âYou Are Welcome Here!â</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WEMU essential coverage of COVID-19 and community impact</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On March 12, WEMU made the painful but necessary decision to postpone its spring on-air fundraiser. While WEMUâs needs for funds are essential to its survival, it was more critical to concentrate on serving the community with real-time news and information: global and national coverage from NPR, local news from the WEMU news team, and coverage of the arts and cultural community through the music programs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since that time, WEMU has been tirelessly on the job, with daily updates from elected officials, community leaders, the medical community, EMU faculty, public safety and public health officials, and the EMU administration. Morning and afternoon news hosts David Fair and Lisa Barry have spent hours gathering information, speaking to news leaders, doing key live interviews, and keeping up with breaking news. The music team has covered the local music scene and its loss of performance income and live concerts. The behind the scenes staff has provided support wherever itâs been needed including the endless updating of social media.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Putting aside their own anxiety for themselves, family, and friends, the WEMU team has been on the job every day (at a social distance and in a carefully sanitized environment) to make sure the community has all the critical information they need.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While this critical coverage has been ongoing, WEMU decided to do a soft fundraiser. This was done using a mix of recorded and live donation requests for online gifts to try and offset some of the loss from not producing a full-fledged on air fundraiser, with program breaks, special guests, and in-studio volunteers answering telephones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>And the community responded in amazing fashion with $93,925 from 455 donors over 8 days, 24 of whom gave $1,000 or more as part of WEMUâs Community Champions giving circle.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Samples from the many comments that accompanied these gifts are below.</p>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âIn these times, it is this independent reporting and news that is crucial to deliver to local residents, thank you for all of your work!â</li></ul>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âWEMU is doing a heroic job of keeping the community informed.â</li></ul>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âKeep the light of music coming in these dark days.â</li></ul>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âI really appreciate your coverage of our community and its efforts to help.â</li></ul>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âThank you for keeping things âjazzyâ during a difficult time for us all.â</li></ul>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>âTo the wonderful WEMU crew in this time of crisis, thank you for supporting the community with your timely and accurate news coverage. We appreciate your dedication to serving all of us.â</li></ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><br>We send our sincere gratitude to our colleagues at WEMU!</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">This section continues to be dedicated to sharing positive efforts among those in our campus community to support others.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zuzana TomaÅ¡,Â EMU associate professor of ESL/TESOL, is feeling extra proud of her children after they designed and created a flyer for Swoop's Food Pantry donations and organized a food drive in their neighborhood! Professor TomaÅ¡ and her children were able to deliver a trunk full of goods to the pantry. During theÂ 10 minutes she and her children were at Swoop's, three other cars came by to drop off donations. Professor TomaÅ¡ stated in an email, "It is incredibleÂ to see our community stepping up and thinking of others during these difficult times.â</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier today we received word of a second positive COVID-19 test result involving one of our students. The student lived in campus housing and was last on campus two weeks ago, on March 12 (the day the university stopped in person classes). The student lived in a single unit and did not have symptoms when they departed campus. The student is now under care at home. Our thoughts and support are with the student and their family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>As in yesterdayâs report, public health officials indicate there is no concern of exposure to others on campus due to the length of time between the studentâs departure from campus and the onset of symptoms.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The health department is following its protocol of tracking close contacts of the student. Those individuals will be contacted separately and advised by the health department to self-quarantine or take other actions.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to federal privacy laws, no personal details or further information about the student is being released. We have been, and continue to be, in very close and regular contact with public health officials at the County and State.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Late yesterday, the<span>Â </span><span>Washtenaw</span><span>Â </span><span>County</span><span>Â </span>Health Department issued an<span>Â </span><a href="https://www.washtenaw.org/DocumentCenter/View/15840/Emergency-Orders-to-Protect-Essential-Workers-March-25" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washtenaw.org/DocumentCenter/View/15840/Emergency-Orders-to-Protect-Essential-Workers-March-25&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585356042637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvQ4KAiaMU19aKyI1eBzsk-ux1qg"><span>Emergency Order</span></a><span>Â </span>requiring essential service providers and businesses to use recommended screening and social distancing to protect everyoneâs health to the greatest degree possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As weâve stated repeatedly, guidance and directives in this crisis continue to evolve and change rapidly with little notice. Eastern Michigan has been working through the day to develop a screening process to meet the Countyâs order, which provides for employees to do their own daily health check prior to working. Specific details about the process were included in an<span>Â </span><a href="/coronavirus/documents/message-to-employees-03-26.pdf?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/documents/message-to-employees-03-26.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585356042637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMDXLgOqc0oPg4PChHoD3CsVJTdg">email to employees on behalf of University Human Resources</a><span>Â </span>a short time ago.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">A few students and parents have asked if coming to campus would violate the Governorâs âStay Home, Stay Safeâ executive order.<span>Â </span><strong>The Governorâs executive order does not prohibit travel for such purposes.</strong><span>Â </span>Section 7 of the Governor's executive order states:</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to donations, Swoopâs has received many wonderful personal care items, games, puzzles, and coloring books, which clients have appreciated.Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Currently needed items include bread, non-dairy milk, tofu, toilet paper, cheese and cream cheese, canned beans, and condiments such as barbecue sauce and hot sauce.Â </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More stories of inspiration<br></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the important and wonderful work by the staff of Swoopâs, we continue to receive many examples of campus community members who are going above and beyond to support our students and fellow citizens during these challenging times. It is truly heartwarming and inspiring!<span>Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Chad Hutchinson, who became Easternâs new orchestra director this past year, is one of many great examples of faculty who continue to support our students remotely and is also ensuring they are practicing self care. As you can imagine, the orchestra director normally spends all of his time working with EMU students in person. Director Hutchinson is now working with all of his students using Zoom and other technologies. He also made a self-care video for his students, and now they are sharing theirÂ own self-care ideas on discussion boards within Canvas. He has played piano pieces for his students (some classical, some jazz) both as a gift to them and also to demonstrate that performing their own art is still very important in these times. His is but one example of all of the large ensemble directors in the School of Music and Dance who have continued teaching content to their students, despite the challenges inherent in those classes.<br>Â <span><span></span></span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Counselors Krystol Alpert and Olivia Kaiserian with Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) have volunteered to serve as crisis counselors for the Crisis Textline during the COVID-19 pandemic. Krystol is completing her masterâs degree in counseling at EMU and Olivia is completing her masterâs degree in social work from the University of Michigan. Both are finishing their respective placements at CAPS this year. The Crisis Textline is a national crisis support service that can be accessed by texting "Hello" to 741-741.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">Last Thursday, the Eastern Michigan University Children's Institute hosted a drive-up opportunity for families to pick up an activity bag and pantry items needed from the Children's Institute Little Free Pantry. Nearly 70 families drove through, with eight Children's InstituteÂ staff helping to distribute the items. The activity bags included a book, playdough, craft items and paper. Mailers with additional activities for families to do at home were also mailed this week, and more are planned toÂ be mailed next week.Â </li></ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoy learning about these efforts as much as I like sharing them with you. As they say, and it is especially true here at Eastern Michigan University, adversity brings out the best in people. We should all be proud of these fine efforts, and the many others that are taking place. Please continue to forward them to us.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As indicated in my message earlier today, this morning we received the unfortunate news from the Washtenaw County Health Department (WCHD) that an Eastern Michigan University student has tested positive for COVID-19. Our thoughts are with the student and their family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>According to the WCHD, the student has not attended classes since March 5. The student lived off campus and is from Wayne County.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There is no indication that the student had the disease at any point while on campus. The WCHD indicates the student would not have been at risk of exposing others until March 19, and at this time there is no indication that the student visited campus since in person classes ended on March 11.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The student is currently hospitalized and is not part of the study abroad group that visited Italy, which we communicated about previously. The health department is following its protocol of tracking close contacts of the student. Those individuals will be contacted separately and advised by the health department if needed to self-quarantine or take other actions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to federal privacy laws, no personal details or further information about the student is being released. We have been, and continue to be, in very close and regular contact with public health officials at the County and State.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As this disease spreads, it is increasingly likely that many of us will at some point know of a family member, friend or associate who has been affected.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In recent campus messages, we have provided examples of exemplary work among members of the Eastern community in supporting others in these difficult and uncertain times. I have asked students, faculty and staff to send other such stories to me so that we might share them with you as we move through this crisis. It is important that we continue to embrace and acknowledge the positive and inspirational efforts of our colleagues and associates.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To students, faculty and staff:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Late this morning, we received the unfortunate news from the<span>Â </span><span>Washtenaw</span><span>Â </span>County Health Department (<span>WCHD</span>) that an Eastern Michigan University student has tested positive for<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19. Our thoughts are with the student and their family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>According to the<span>Â </span><span>WCHD</span>, the student has not attended classes since March 5. The student lived off campus and is from Wayne County.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There is no indication that the student had the disease at any point while on campus. The<span>Â </span><span>WCHD</span><span>Â </span>indicates the student would not have been at risk of exposing others until March 19, and at this time there is no indication of visits to campus since in person classes ended on March 11</strong>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The student is currently hospitalized and is not part of the study abroad group that visited Italy, which we communicated about previously. The health department is following its protocol of tracking close contacts of the student. Those individuals will be contacted separately and advised by the health department if needed to self-quarantine or take other actions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to federal privacy laws, no personal details or further information about the student is permitted. We have been, and continue to be, in very close and regular contact with public health officials at the County and State. It is important to continue to follow hand-washing, social distancing and other<span>Â </span><a href="/coronavirus/documents/prevention-tips.pdf?v=2020-03-24T22:20:59Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/documents/prevention-tips.pdf?v%3D2020-03-24T22:20:59Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585249947254000&amp;usg=AFQjCNES3WK1_PgaAcckfMRAfAYK1fTueg"><span>prevention measures</span></a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As this disease spreads, it is increasingly likely that many of us will at some point know of a family member, friend or associate who has been affected. Our thoughts and support are with all of those who are fighting this disease, those family members who are worried about their loved ones, and also with our health, medical and first responder communities who are on the front lines every day.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The light of dawn this morning brought with it the new day, but also a new way of conducting our personal and professional lives. Governor Whitmerâs<span>Â </span><a href="https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-522625--,00.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-522625--,00.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585174178758000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwOeZDBoI_Donk2XJhQ8o7z_RpNQ">âStay Home, Stay Safeâ Executive Order</a><span>Â </span>went into effect this morning, further restricting our day-to-day routines as we all adjust to this unprecedented crisis. The Governorâs actions, and those occurring in other states and at the federal level, are deeply needed and necessary as we fight the global pandemic of COVID-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As announced yesterday, the University implemented several additional actions following the Governorâs Executive Order. Those actions are in alignment with and extend the steps the University already has in place to reduce the on campus work force.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, employees working on campus include only those designated by their supervisors in the following areas: 1) those engaged in the safety and well-being of our community; 2) those involved in the maintenance of facilities and business operations; 3) employees in housing who are supporting the remaining students who live on campus; 4) support services personnel who facilitate online/virtual/distance learning technologies; and, 5) those working at WEMU 89.1 for their role in providing critical information to the public.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In each of these cases, it is expected that public health guidance for social distancing and hand washing/hygiene is followed. We also ask that any of the above designated employees or students who still live on campus who feel ill or symptomatic of COVID-19, stay home, self-monitor and contact their medical provider as necessary.<span>Â </span><span>Â </span><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have several updates to share with you today.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of Temporary COVID-19 Related Leave Allowance for eligible employees</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The University is extending the time frame in which its Temporary COVID-19 Related Leave is available. Full-time, benefits-eligible employees are eligible for up to 80 hours<span>Â </span>of additional paid time off pursuant to this leave through Monday, April 13, 2020.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This additional time must be used in the case of quarantine, isolation or family care needs related to COVID-19 exposure or illness, or other related scenarios, including a temporary lack of work assignments. This is a one-time allowance of paid time off to be utilized during this current pandemic. If the leave allowance is exhausted before April 13, sick leave and/or other leave may be used. This COVID-19 leave allowance is subject to prior approval by your supervisor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Employees with questions may contact the University Human Resources Benefits Office at<span>Â </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7eff5f8e5c2c9c2c1ced3d4e7c2cacec4cf89c2c3d2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8bc3d9d4c9eee5eeede2fff8cbeee6e2e8e3a5eeeffe">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>.

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Residence halls/housing move-out questions</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have received many questions from students who have left their resident hall room or apartment, but did not formally checkout and still have items remaining in their room or apartment. We also have been asked if coming to campus would violate the Governorâs âStay Home, Stay Safeâ executive order.<span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>First, yesterdayâs Executive Order by the Governor does not prohibit travel for such purposes</strong>.<span>Â </span>Section 7 of the Governor's executive order states as follows:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Section 7(b): Individuals may also travel:<br>(1) To return to a home or place of residence from outside this state.<br>(2) To leave this state for a home or residence elsewhere.<br>(3) To travel between two residences in this state.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Students moving their belongings from campus to their permanent residence fall within these exceptions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Further, to be eligible for the housing and/or dining credit previously announced, all personal items must be removed and formal checkout and key return completed no later than March 31 at 5 p.m.</strong><span>Â </span>The University cannot store personal belongs or furniture.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the University must undertake a deep cleaning of all residence hall rooms and apartments, and cannot begin that process until a room has been officially vacated for 14 days, in the interest of the safety of our employees who clean the rooms, following public health guidance.<span>Â </span><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update on student grade and withdrawal options</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We received several questions from students about the announcement from the Provostâs office yesterday about extended deadlines for student grade and class withdrawal options. As indicated yesterday, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Extending the deadline until the end of the semester for students to request the Pass/No Pass grading option;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Extending the deadline until the end of the semester for students to request certain types of withdrawals from courses;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Waiving degree requirements related to the cancellation of one-credit-hour in person PEGN courses since the decision to suspend in person operations; and,Â </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Implementing alternative means of completing LBC requirements for graduation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Students will receive details on how to extend the deadlines and waivers noted above in a separate email from the Provostâs Office that will be sent within the hour.<span>Â </span><span>Â </span><span>Â </span><span>Â </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Student government elections postponed until September 2020</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the unprecedented disruption to campus life that affects every student, the University has postponed until September 2020 the Student Government election that was scheduled to occur tomorrow, March 25, and Thursday, March 26. The exact date of the September election will be determined and announced in the near future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that students retain representation, the current Student Government â which was scheduled to remain in place until late-April â will continue in their roles until the transition to a new Student Government this fall. All candidates who submitted a valid petition to run in the March election will automatically appear on the September election ballot unless they request to have their name removed. As with all matters related to this rapidly evolving global crisis, we will continue to update students about the election process.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moving forward</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This morning I participated in an<span>Â </span><a href="https://www.wemu.org/post/emu-president-adapting-educational-changes-during-covid-19-outbreak" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wemu.org/post/emu-president-adapting-educational-changes-during-covid-19-outbreak&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585174178758000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBWk2jYRAZUr5hBeN__qyED6YBRg">in-depth interview on WEMU 89.1</a><span>Â </span>conducted via phone by Morning Edition host David Fair. The extensive discussion included recent actions taken by the University to ensure the health and safety of our campus community, and the transition to distance/online learning and remote operations for a majority of our employees. The interview addresses many of the ongoing questions that have been raised by our students, faculty and staff â you may find it helpful in answering questions you have.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition,<span>Â </span><strong>today we posted a new<span>Â </span><a href="/coronavirus/faq.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/faq.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585174178758000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOSHh0kCu8jLLXpnX049WosGlpXw">Frequently Asked Questions</a><span>Â </span>resource to the Universityâs COVID-19 website</strong>. It features a drop-down format with individual sections for questions pertaining to specific areas of our University community: University Operations; Students; Instructors; Staff; Parents and Family; Community Members; Prospective Students; Travel; and, COVID-19 Information. We hope you will find this to be helpful resource in addressing questions you may have.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these times of trial and challenge, the Eastern Michigan University community continues to do wonderful things to support our fellow citizens. We have continued to highlight the work of Swoopâs Food Pantry. Some other recent initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Easternâs nursing program developed a plan for nursing<span>Â </span>students, faculty, and/or alumni to assist IHA at their nearby drive-thru COVID-19 testing sites. A total of 245 people have volunteered to participate in this effort.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>EMU Police committed to assisting in the delivery of Meals on Wheels in the community, with more than 20 officers volunteering for deliveries next week.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>And, as mentioned in previous messages, our community continues to donate medical supplies to be delivered to local hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are undoubtedly many more examples of these kinds of efforts happening throughout the University community. Please share them with us. It is important at these times of challenge that we continue to embrace and support the positive actions around us -- they reflect the very best of the human spirit.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In light of Governor Whitmerâs <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-522625--,00.html" target="_blank">âStay Home, Stay Safeâ Executive Order</a> issued this morning, the University implemented a number of actions today. They are designed to further reduce the workforce working daily on campus beyond our initial actions, which require non-designated employees to work remotely.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This remains an extremely fluid and evolving situation, reflecting the emergency and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 global crisis. As we all know, guidance and directives are changing daily. The University is working diligently to adjust operations rapidly to meet the changing situation as we assess their impact on University operations and implement the new directives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Today, under the terms of the Governorâs Executive Order, we are instructing employees to refrain from coming to campus unless they are part of a smaller group of designated employees, which include those:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Needed to maintain essential business and facility operations.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Providing instructional support services for online/virtual/distance learning.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Involved in urgent health and wellness needs of students.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Assisting in the wind-down of on campus housing and student resident checkout, which is to be completed by 5 p.m. March 31. A majority of our on campus residents have moved out, including more than 1,200 students who left over this past weekend. As noted previously, not everyoneÂ can move out. For some students, Eastern is a permanent address, or a destination for international students and students from far away in the U.S. Other students have special circumstances that affect their ability to return to their permanent place of residence.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Involved in vital public communications during the crisis, such as WEMU 89.1, the Universityâs National Public Radio station.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>Employees who are included in this smaller group and designated to work on campus will be notified by their supervisors. Other employees who have been working remotely should continue to do so.</strong></p>
<p>Employees who have items in the workplace they need to retrieve before the order goes into effect at midnight should get them this evening. Swipe card access to all buildings is in place for today only. Buildings will be closed tomorrow. Employees designated to work on campus should call DPS (734.487.1222) to advise them of the building they are working in and the length of time they will be there.</p>
<p>Due to the Governorâs Executive Order, the <strong>Student Center closed at 5 p.m. today</strong> and will remain closed at least through April 13 as noted in the Governorâs Executive Order. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.emucu.org/" target="_blank">EMU Credit Union</a>, which had been open by appointment only. Drive thru operations continue atÂ nearby branches; and,</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.bkstr.com/easternmichiganstore/home" target="_blank">EMU Bookstore</a>, which offers several free online initiatives to support students, including eBooks,Â access to Lumen Learning OER Courseware, online shipping, and deadline extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Student grade and withdrawal options</strong></span></p>
<p>Under these unprecedented circumstances and consistent with our commitment to support the academic needs of students in every way possible, the Provostâs Office is adjusting student grade and withdrawal options. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extending the deadline for students to request the Pass/No Pass grading option;</li>
<li>Extending the deadline for students to request certain types of withdrawals from courses;</li>
<li>Waiving degree requirements related to the cancellation of one-credit hour in person PEGN courses since the decision to suspend in person operations; and,</li>
<li>Implementing alternative means of completing LBC requirements for graduation.</li>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I appreciate everyoneâs patience and understanding in these difficult times. The actions and decisions we are implementing daily are in direct response to the national emergency surrounding COVID-19 and directives from the executive and state branches of government. They also are in alignment with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Washtenaw County Health Department.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In response to yesterdayâs message about closing residence halls and on campus apartments effective Tuesday, March 31, more than 700 students are scheduled to move out this weekend. Housing staff is deliberate in the scheduling process to spread the move-outs apart in observance of social distancing guidance. I thank students and families for your cooperation through this process. My sincere appreciation to housing staff who are working tirelessly to ensure a safe and efficient process.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As noted in yesterdayâs communications, students living in residence halls or on campus apartments should<span>Â </span>visit the<span>Â </span><a href="/residencelife/index.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/residencelife/index.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584829004242000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgJE4Bl6KU_dY3VEZWSjS3kT_r0Q"><span>housing website</span></a><span>Â </span>for move-out details and to schedule a check-out time. This<span>Â </span><strong>must be completed by 11:59 p.m. tonight</strong>, Friday, March 20. Our housing team will not be able to accommodate all those who want to check out at the same time, so please be flexible. At their scheduled time, students should check-out at their respective service desk. Parking will be free during the move-out process.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that not everyone can move out. In some cases, Eastern is a permanent address, or a destination for international students and students from far away in the U.S. Other students have other special circumstances that affect their ability to return to their permanent place of residence. Exceptions to the mandatory move-out exist for those students. Please email the housing office if you have questions at<span>Â </span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c6463797f65626b4c6961656f6422696879"><span><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1971766c6a70777e597c74707a71377c7d6c">[emailÂ protected]</span></span></a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some students have asked how they will be notified about their housing and/or meal plan credit, as was<span>Â </span><a href="/documents/residence-halls-update-3-19.pdf?v=2020-03-20T15:16:34Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/documents/residence-halls-update-3-19.pdf?v%3D2020-03-20T15:16:34Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584829004242000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHJGDfWKspu-AWrf4n8C6WITSdesA"><span>announced</span></a><span>Â </span>yesterday. Eligible students will be notified by email from Student Business Services once the assessment process is completed. As noted yesterday, processing the entire population of students living in campus housing and on meal plans will take some time, and we ask for your patience. It is important to remember the unprecedented time we are in and the state of emergency that surrounds, and affects, all of our actions.</p>

Students should only report on their timesheets those hours that they have worked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The University recognizes that with the temporary modification of campus operations, certain student employees may not be needed. We understand that many students rely on their student employment to make ends meet and that the impact of not working could lead to serious financial consequences.<span>Â </span><strong>We are reviewing this matter, as well as guidance from the U.S. Department of Education and other government agencies.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you, I am closely monitoring government and public health updates. The number of positive COVID-19 cases in Michigan today increased to more than 500. There were no cases reported in Michigan just 10 days ago, until Tuesday evening, March 10. The predicted escalation in the number of cases is clearly happening now and the health care system is under tremendous stress.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The University is taking every precaution to ensure the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff. This guides every decision we make, every day. As Iâve said repeatedly, our students, faculty and staff have conducted themselves with the greatest of skill, expertise and understanding throughout this crisis. This is a time for everyone to work together, to protect one another, and ensure we follow hygiene and social distancing guidance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please continue to follow that guidance and the Washtenaw County Health DepartmentÂ <a href="/coronavirus/documents/prevention-tips.pdf?v=2020-03-19T18:19:15Z?v=2020-03-20T15:16:34Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/documents/prevention-tips.pdf?v%3D2020-03-19T18:19:15Z?v%3D2020-03-20T15:16:34Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584829004243000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkz1haIJ_R_UTyrcA4RwS33kI9eA">prevention recommendations</a><span>Â </span>that have been provided in my daily updates.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and declarations of emergency at the national, state and local level, we have instructed our<span>Â </span><strong>residence halls to close effective Tuesday, March 31 at 5 p.m.</strong><span>Â </span>This applies to all students living in residence halls, with the exception of international students, students from far distances, or those who have other special circumstances.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have given great and careful thought to this decision, as we have to every action taken as we respond to this global crisis. It follows our announcement yesterday to extend online-only course delivery through the end of the winter semester, which eliminates the possibility of in-person classes for the remainder of the semester. We are not the first University to order such actions, and we wonât be the last.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have implemented a credit process to reimburse students for some of their housing and meal plan expenses this semester. These plans were articulated directly to students a short time ago in a<span>Â </span><a href="/documents/residence-halls-update-3-19.pdf?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/documents/residence-halls-update-3-19.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584744333194000&amp;usg=AFQjCNERl63UbhNDOhPwgnO_ubssCHJHrg">message from Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Calvin Phillips and Chief Financial Office Mike Valdes</a>. The message also provided specifics and directions about the move-out process to take place starting tomorrow through March 31.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These decisions and actions are intended to ensure the continued safety and well-being of our entire community at a time of crisis and great uncertainty. We all are witness to the rapidly changing world around us. We all are trying to adjust to these changes â changes that affect us personally and professionally. While we work to maintain University operations, we are concerned about our loved ones and friends. Keeping apart from one another, socially distancing ourselves, is the most effective way to slow the spread of the disease.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please continue to follow that guidance and the<span>Â </span><a href="/coronavirus/documents/prevention-tips.pdf?v=2020-03-19T18:19:15Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/documents/prevention-tips.pdf?v%3D2020-03-19T18:19:15Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584744333194000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgkF5m8pSSj_VkIFEiY5f1P61jKg"><span>prevention recommendations</span></a><span>Â </span>that have been provided in my daily updates. In short, this is best thing all of us can do to make a difference in the midst of this crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have other important updates for you today:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Temporary COVID-19 Related Leave Allowance</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To ease the impact<span>Â </span>of COVID-19 on full-time, benefits-eligible staff, EMU has established a temporary, 80-hour leave allowance. Effective today, March 19, through April 6, full-time, benefits-eligible staff members are eligible for up to 80 hours of additional paid time off.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This additional time must be used in the case of quarantine, isolation or family care needs related to COVID-19 exposure or illness, or other related scenarios, including a temporary lack of work assignments. This is a one-time allowance of paid time off to be utilized during this current pandemic. If the leave allowance is exhausted before April 6, sick leave and/or other leave may be used. This COVID-19 leave allowance is subject to prior approval by your supervisor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Staff will be instructed on how to report use of the COVID-19 leave allowance in a future communication. We understand there will be other questions. Feel free to contact University Human Resources and monitor EMUâs COVID-19 website for updates.Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summer/Fall registration</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the evolving situation, we have made some changes to our registration schedules.<span>Â </span><strong>Registration for fall classes will begin Monday, March 23</strong>.<span>Â </span><strong>Registration for summer classes is being pushed back</strong><span>Â </span>to a later date to be announced, as we<span>Â </span>work to adjust to changes in class delivery and scheduling.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the continuing spread of<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 and based on declarations of emergency and guidance from federal, state, and local government and public health officials, the University has made the important decision to<span>Â </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extend online/virtual class program delivery through the end of the winter semester, April 27</span></strong>. This decision was made after discussion and consultation with bargaining unit leadership and support, which I greatly appreciate. In person, on campus classes will not take place for the remainder of the semester.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Employees, other than those designated by their supervisors, will continue to work remotely for the time being. A return date to regular on campus operations for employees will be communicated at a later date, as this evolving situation warrants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These are important actions. They would have been unheard of just months ago. But they reflect the severity of the health crisis facing our community, state, nation and world. It is not a time for business as usual. It is a time for reassurance. It is a time for action, and leadership. And, it is a time for addressing the Universityâs number one mission and priority â protecting the health and safety of our community. It also is a time for creativity and ingenuity as we deliver Easternâs high quality education to students in new and different ways to ensure their continued success.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I again want to offer my sincere appreciation to everyone who is adjusting to these changes. Our faculty and staff have responded with overwhelming support, with a âcan doâ attitude that reflects the very best qualities of everything Eastern Michigan University stands for. Your passion for what we do and your commitment to making a monumental operational transformation to an online/virtual environment is a source of deep pride for all of us.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Several other operational items are important to address in todayâs update, including helpful information for students about the computer lab, Holman Success Center, and CAPS:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Computer lab to open</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ground floor computer lab in<span>Â </span><span>Halle</span><span>Â </span>will open tomorrow, Thursday, March 19, and Friday, March 20, from 10 a.m. â 6 p.m. The technology computer labs also will open for technology students.

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Students living in residence halls</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this public health crisis,Â and in light of the need to continue online course delivery through the end of the semester, we strongly encourage students living on campus to return to their permanent place of residence for the remainder of the semester (unless they are international students, are from far distances, or have other special circumstances requiring them to remain).</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These are unprecedented times. The ongoing spread of<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 and the speed at which things are changing around us are affecting our lives in ways we could not have imagined. Our Eastern community continues to work constructively during these challenges, with the highest priority on the health and safety of everyone at our University. As you have observed, we are continually adapting our operations to meet this health crisis. We are working tirelessly, and taking every precaution. We also are committed to keeping you informed on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To our faculty and staff, thank you for all you have been doing to lead our campus through a very difficult time. We appreciate your dedication and compassion for our students and your co-workers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>University operations</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Based on questions we are receiving, it is important we are clear about University operations, and that any emails, out-of-office messages, websites and other communications, conversations or presentations reflect the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong>The University is not "closed."Â The University is "open with modified operations.âÂ <br><br></strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong>We continue to serve our students in a virtual/online environment with most employees working remotely.<br><br></strong>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong>Our operations reflect the emergency orders on the national, state and local levels, as well as ongoing guidance we receive from federal, state and local public health officials.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Internet access/computer support</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Students and employees have contacted us about what to do if they do not have<span>Â </span><span>internet</span><span>Â </span>access or a computing device. With<span>Â </span><span>Halle</span>Â Library operations suspended under the Governorâs executive order, it is a priority for us to provide students with access to the computer labs. We hope to finalize this plan shortly and expect to have information to share tomorrow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of the<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 health crisis, many<span>Â </span><span>internet</span><span>Â </span>providers are offering plans to support individuals at this time with low cost or free services.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With the number of confirmed<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 cases in Michigan now up to 53 today, Governor<span>Â </span><span>Whitmer</span><span>Â </span>hours ago issued several important executive orders that directly affect our operations. These include the closure of restaurants, gyms and fitness centers, and libraries. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has revised its guidance regarding large crowds, recommending that for the next eight weeks, organizers cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the U.S.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, effective today, the University is announcing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Campus Dining</span></strong>: Consistent with Governor Whitmerâs executive order, all campus dining operations will move to a âgrab and goâ/takeout format, effective this evening. Campus dining options are limited to the Eateries,<span>Â </span><span>Homestyle</span><span>Â </span>@ Cluck, and the Market in the Student Center for the immediate future. Operating hours are posted on the<span>Â </span><a href="https://www.dineoncampus.com/emu" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dineoncampus.com/emu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584471458001000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFEAu3pNhJVmeNe7H-VgAYNJXhiwA"><span>dining website</span></a>. Students<span>Â </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">should not congregate and eat with one another</span><span>Â </span>due to public health social distancing recommendations.<br><br>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rec/<span>IM</span></span></strong>: The Rec/<span>IM</span><span>Â </span>will close at 3 p.m. today and will remain closed for the immediate future, under the executive order from Governor<span>Â </span><span>Whitmer</span>. This includes the Jones Pool and locker facilities.<br><br>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Halle</span><span>Â </span>Library</span></strong>:<span>Â </span><span>Halle</span><span>Â </span>Library will close at 3 p.m. today, again following the executive order issued by Governor<span>Â </span><span>Whitmer</span>. It will remain closed for the immediate future.<span>Â </span><strong>We are assessing whether the computer lab can remain open and will have a further update soon</strong>.<br><br>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spring Commencement</span></strong>: Spring Commencement, scheduled for April 25, is postponed to a later date to be determined. We understand that this is a disappointment for the students who worked hard to earn their degree as well as their families, but this action is necessary pursuant to the various government emergency directives and guidelines regarding large audiences as our entire nation seeks to mitigate the spread of<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19. We are committed to re-scheduling<span>Â </span><span>Â </span>Commencement ceremonies to a later date, and all graduates and their families will be advised of those plans once decided. This also includes the Multicultural Graduation ceremony, which also is postponed until further notice.<br><br>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extending online class schedule</span></strong>: The University is continually evaluating its initially announced plans to resume in-person classes on April 1. We stated from the beginning that this timeline was fluid and would be adjusted if necessary. In light of the recent changes in guidance from the Governorâs office and the CDC, it now appears likely that we will need to further extend online/virtual class delivery and delay resumption of in-person classes on campus. We will have an announcement in this regard later this week.<span>Â </span><br><br>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Students living in residence halls</span></strong>: Due to this public health crisis,Â students living on campus are strongly encouraged to return to their permanent place of residence temporarily (unless they are international students, are from far distances, or have other special circumstances requiring them to remain).</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><br>I will continue to emphasize: The most important thing any of us can do at this time is to follow recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes avoiding close interaction and practicing social distancing. We understand that tomorrow is St. Patrickâs Day, an occasion in which many people want to gather and celebrate. I emphasize, and both Michiganâs Governor and our health experts agree, this is<span>Â </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong><span>Â </span>the time for those activities. Please refrain from such gatherings this year. Such interaction puts you in danger of contracting the disease and spreading it to others.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>This is a time for all of us to practice self-care. Take care of yourselves.<span>Â </span></span>The<span>Â </span><span>Washtenaw</span><span>Â </span>County Health Department has published a<span>Â </span><a title="Go to Washtenaw County Health Department tips" href="/coronavirus/documents/prevention-tips.pdf?v=2020-03-16T15:51:15Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">comprehensive</span> list<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> [<span>PDF</span>]</span></span></a>Â of prevention measures.</p>

<p>To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p>These are challenging times filled with uncertainty and stress. This evening, Governor Whitmer announced 12 new cases of COVID-19 in Michigan, bringing the total number of people infected inÂ the state to 45, with many more tests currently underway.</p>
<p>The days and weeks ahead are going to be difficult as we all navigate this global pandemic and declarations of emergency in our nation, state, county and municipality, and the evolving changes in guidance and recommendations from public health and government officials.</p>
<p>It is our commitment to you to continue to keep you informed and updated as the University responds to this health crisis.</p>
<p>Public health experts are clear: social distancing is critical to preventing the spread COVID-19. Our actions reflect that priority.</p>
<p>All EMU employees who have not been otherwise informed or designated by their supervisorÂ areÂ expected to begin working remotelyÂ tomorrow,Â Monday, March 16. Supervisors should be in touch with each employee via email or phone to confirm arrangements for their work and to resolve any areas of concern.Â A guide has been developed to assist employees in this effort: <a href="/coronavirus/documents/preparing-to-work-remotely.pdf?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" target="_blank">Preparing to work remotely [PDF]</a>.Â Employees should contact their supervisorÂ immediatelyÂ if they are unclear about whether they have been designated to work on campus or have not confirmed work arrangements.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, March 16, 2020,Â the University will launch an online/virtual schedule and support structure as noted in previous campus messages last week.Â Only a very few offices should be operating in person and protocols should be worked through for how this will occur in a manner than maintains social distancing and hygiene expectations to the highest degree possible. This is a significant undertaking and a processÂ for whichÂ we have prepared.Â It requires many changes to the typical class delivery modelÂ andÂ weÂ ask everyoneâs patience as we work through theseÂ newÂ processes and adjust in the coming days. Please be patient and supportive with colleagues and community members who are less comfortable with this form of interaction. Our communityâs support for each other during this time has made me so proud as a leader. Letâs stay strong as we dive into the deep water this week!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FOR STUDENTS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Online class plans</strong></span></p>
<p>Instructors either have or will soon be in contact with their students about next steps in their courses. We realize that some issues remain to be determined including full lab, practicum, and studio solutions but contact should be underway.Â If there are questions about this, students should (as always) first contact their instructor via email and then the department head or school director who leads the area that sponsors the course.</p>
<p>We continue to work with faculty and staff who conduct performance classes such as dance and art, as well as laboratory classes, to determine the best approach for those classes. I ask for your patience as we work through these items. These courses are difficult to recreate virtually but solutions continue to emerge out of the creativity and commitment of our outstanding instructional staff. Please be patient as we problem solve -- we all remain committed to a full educational experience in the face of an unprecedented disruption in the national educational system.Â </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Students in residence halls</strong></span></p>
<p>Due to public health recommendations for social distancing during this emergency,Â students living on campus are strongly encouraged to return to their permanent place of residence temporarily (unless they are international students, from out of state or have other special circumstances).</p>

<p>During the on-campus suspension of activities, CAPS is working to provide support to students, while maintaining the physical health of our campus community. All in-person appointments have been canceled to minimize social contacts.Â Instead, current clients have been contacted by email and will also be called early this week by a CAPS therapist.Â CAPS will be offering phone support to any students in need from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m., Monday - Friday.</p>
<p>CAPS will continue to offer after-hours phone support through the main CAPS phone line (734.487.1118) after 5 p.m. and on weekends. If you have questions or need to speak with a counselor, please contact us at 734.487.1118 or by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5c6cad0cbd6c0c9cccbc28bd6c0d7d3ccc6c0d6e5c0c8ccc6cd8bc0c1d0"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="096a667c677a6c6560676e277a6c7b7f606a6c7a496c64606a61276c6d7c">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p>To minimize social contacts, the shopping process will be adjusted:Â Staff will walk the aisles with clients and staff will fill the bags, thereby reducing touching of handles, produce, etc., by clients. Visitors to Swoopâs can enter through the main entrance on the north side of Pierce Hall near the elevator.</p>
<p>We will provide an update on next weekâs Swoopâs schedule later in the week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Overall student issues and concerns</strong></span></p>
<p>The Dean of Students office is a central point for studentsÂ who haveÂ aÂ concern orÂ need assistance that has not been addressed elsewhere in our updates. They will likely direct you to other offices on campus as needed so please carefully review their responses. We ask that you please hold questions that are not time sensitive issues until midweek to allow for adjustment to this new mode of operation. The Dean of Students office is best contacted via email atÂ <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#145159414b5071757a7b7247606170717a60675471797d777c3a717061"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5a1f170f051e3f3b34353c092e2f3e3f342e291a3f37333932743f3e2f">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>. Please recall that course related issues should be addressed first with your instructor and then the relevant Department Head or School Director.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FOR EMPLOYEES</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Buildings open tomorrow for retrieval of laptops, materials</strong></span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>To the Eastern Michigan University community:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Preparations for the start of online classes on Monday, March 16 are moving forward. We appreciate student, faculty and staff understanding and patience as we begin this journey, along with our university colleagues across the country, into what are largely uncharted waters.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>We are committed throughout this process to operate with the utmost concern for the health and well being of students, faculty and staff. Our decisions are based on fully supporting social distancing recommendations as guided by the Centers for Disease Control as well as local and state public health officials.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>We have several important operational items for todayâs update:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>FOR STUDENTS</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Student employees</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Student employees can continue to work at the discretion of their supervisors, either on campus or remotely as directed by supervisors.<br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The University recognizes that with the temporary reduction in on campus operations, certain student employees will not be needed, such as in dining and other areas. We understand that many students rely heavily on their student employment to make ends meet and that the impact of not working could lead to serious financial consequences. The U.S. Department of Education is reviewing this matter and is expected to provide guidance to universities within the next week. The University will evaluate the federal guidance and assess how best to support our students. We hope to be able to provide a plan for those students within the next week. In the meantime, all students who worked over the past two weeks will receive their pay as scheduled on March 19.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Registration for Fall 2020 classes delayed one week</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Given the disruption in the regular class schedule, the University is delaying the opening of Fall 2020 class registration by one week, to Monday, March 23.<span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Hours for<span>Â </span><span>Halle</span><span>Â </span>Library, EMU Dining and Rec/<span>IM</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Updated hours for these operations are posted on their respective<span>Â </span><span>webpages</span>:</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>FOR EMPLOYEES</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span>Webinars</span><span>Â </span>for faculty</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>We understand todayâs<span>Â </span><span>webinars</span><span>Â </span>did not go as planned for faculty. We are working through these issues and appreciate your patience and understanding. We will continue to provide updates as soon as possible. As I indicated on Wednesday, with such a massive undertaking and transition to online/virtual classes, there are bound to be some challenges along the way. Working together, we will overcome them.<span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Building access</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Swipe card access should work for your building in order to access<span>Â </span><span>workspaces</span><span>Â </span>and offices over the weekend and over the next two weeks when online/virtual classes are held.<br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>As indicated previously,<span>Â </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all buildings will be open Monday, March 16</span></strong><span>Â </span>so that employees can retrieve laptops and materials needed to work remotely. If you are unable to swipe into your building, please contact the Department of Public Safety at 734.487.1222.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Desktop computers</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Employees who wish to take desktop computers and peripheral equipment out of their office to work remotely should complete an<span>Â </span><a title="Go to equipment checkout request form" href="https://itservice.emich.edu/catalog_items/985164-desktop-computer-checkout-contingency-operations/service_requests/new.portal" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://itservice.emich.edu/catalog_items/985164-equipment-checkout-contingency-operations&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584222615011000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2-4L_ABuKI993LUwvkgwAOyQWag">equipment checkout request form</a>.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Payroll and<span>Â </span><span>timesheets</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Payroll operations continue as standard. Employee pay will be processed in accordance with the typical schedule.<br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>For<span>Â </span><span>timesheets</span>, employees should classify yesterday and today (March 12, 13) as they would for a snow day. Beginning Monday, March 16, all employees should resume routine<span>Â </span><span>timesheet</span><span>Â </span>entry â those who work remotely and designated employees who work on campus.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Campus mail pickup</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>In order to minimize interaction and embrace social distancing, mail pickup will be centralized beginning Monday, March 16 through the planned return to campus operations on Monday, March 30. All offices will be required to pick up their mail from the mail office.<br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>OVERALL CAMPUS</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Campus cleaning</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The Universityâs facilities team continues its enhanced cleaning efforts across campus. They are concentrating on touch points (door handles, light switches, desk tops, etc.) and will cover all of campus before the currently scheduled employee return to campus on Monday, March 30, with on campus classes currently scheduled to resume on Wednesday April 1.<span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>By Monday, March 16, bathrooms in the following buildings will have been power-washed and fogged with an electrostatic disinfectant:<span>Â </span></span><span>Porter, Marshall,<span>Â </span><span>Halle</span>, Quirk, Pray-<span>Harrold</span>, Mark Jefferson, Strong,<span>Â </span><span>Sherzer</span>, Hover, Briggs, Student Center, Rec/<span>IM</span>, Bowen and Alexander.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Public spaces that are used daily, such as<span>Â </span><span>Halle</span><span>Â </span>Library, the Rec/<span>IM</span><span>Â </span>and the Student Center, will continue to receive daily cleaning and disinfecting.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The University has expanded its purchase of disinfectant wipes to distribute across campus. The demand for wipes locally and nationally is great and we are working to purchase and distribute as many as we can obtain.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Swoopâs Food Pantry</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The University recognizes the importance and need for Swoopâs Food Pantry. Given the challenging circumstances with employment both on campus and off, the need for a resource such as Swoopâs is likely more important today than it was a week ago. We are currently reviewing plans to resume some level of operations next week. We will advise you when the plan is in place.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>MOVING FORWARD</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>My most important request of everyone as we enter the weekend is to continue to practice prevention. Practice social distancing. Employees should work remotely if and when you can (and if you are not a designated employee). Wash hands thoroughly and frequently. Sanitize and disinfect. Avoid contact with people who are sick.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Mondayâs launch of fully online classes will be challenging, but I know we are capable of meeting that challenge. As I said earlier, these are uncharted waters â not only for us but for our university colleagues across the country.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>We communicated previously our intention to resume on campus classes on Wednesday, April 1, with employees returning on Monday, March 30. We are closely following the changing situation, including guidance from the Governorâs office and public health officials in this regard. These dates may be modified as we indicated from the outset. We will update you further next week.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>I appreciate your patience, support and understanding as we move forward through these unprecedented days that test our creativity and resilience. Please continue to monitor<span>Â </span><a href="/coronavirus/index.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/index.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584222615011000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH341hFsjMMqUKxOvEmG22xKMFx7Q">Eastern's COVID-19 website</a><span>Â </span>and your campus email for further updates</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>To the Eastern Michigan University community:</span><span><span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Our teams are working swiftly and with great precision to prepare our campus community for the launch of a nearly fully virtual/online course schedule beginning on Monday, March 16, as was noted in yesterdayâs announcement.</span><span><span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FOR STUDENTS</strong></span><span><span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Canvas</span></span></strong><span><span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Earlier this morning, students were sent an<span>Â </span></span><a href="/coronavirus/documents/new-winter2020-courses-canvas.pdf?v=2020-03-12T17:46:23Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/documents/new-winter2020-courses-canvas.pdf?v%3D2020-03-12T17:46:23Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584134964800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgOxgYiez3vikIVazXdPJQFR2ntw"><span>email about newly created course shells in Canvas</span></a><span><span>Â </span>for those courses that were not using Canvas previously.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Your instructor will communicate with you soon, if they haven't already, about how they intend to modify their course plan. Plan on checking your email and<span>Â </span><span>Canvas</span><span>Â </span>(if appropriate)<span>Â </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least daily</span><span>Â </span>for messages from your instructor or the University about staying connected with your courses.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Residence halls</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Most students living in residence halls have chosen to return to their permanent place of residence for the next two weeks due to public health recommendations for social distancing.<br></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>As noted yesterday, on campus, in person classes are suspended through March 31. This date is subject to change depending on new information and health updates.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Public health experts are clear on this: staying apart from one another is one of the most significant actions one can take to avoid COVID-19.</span><span><span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>We understand that international students, students living out of state and others may not be able to return to their permanent place of residence. For that reason, limited residence hall and dining are available for those studen</span><span>ts.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Students who stay on campusÂ <a href="https://emich.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/AA077DB5/5/6/Home-Portal_Home_Page?UrlToken=F6AF20B9" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://emich.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/AA077DB5/5/6/Home-Portal_Home_Page?UrlToken%3DF6AF20B9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584134964800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE04kqrdFeuCPhOpVHlqkebNSWM3w">must register online</a>Â by Saturday, March 14, so the University can appropriately prepare and staff residence halls and dining facilities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FOR EMPLOYEES</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As discussed in yesterdayâs announcement, all EMU employees who have not been otherwise informed or designated by their supervisor will be expected to work remotely as of Monday, March 16. Accordingly, EMU employees need to prepare to work remotely. A step-by-step guide has been developed to assist employees in this effort:<span>Â </span><a href="/coronavirus/documents/preparing-to-work-remotely.pdf?v=2020-03-12T17:46:23Z?v=2020-04-21T13:31:18Z" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/documents/preparing-to-work-remotely.pdf?v%3D2020-03-12T17:46:23Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584134964800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGX5XJbDpZ8SWNl90cjFl7M9YVgjQ">Preparing to work remotely</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As of today, EMU employees are expected to return and work on campus on<span>Â </span><strong>Monday, March 30, 2020</strong>. However, the COVID-19 situation is evolving daily so EMU continues to evaluate this timeline. University email is the official form of communication for all EMU employees â so all EMU employees are expected to monitor it for updates.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All instructional personnel should continue to communicate with their department and monitor emails from the Office of the Provost for updates related to the delivery of online classes and instruction.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>CANCELLATIONS</span></span></strong><span><span>Â </span></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>We continue to receive many questions about cancellations. As announced yesterday, all University events have been cancelled through March 31. This decision was made out of an abundance of caution. Governor Whitmerâs recommendation is that any gatherings of more than 100 people should be cancelled. We determined it was important for the health and well being of our community that we go above and beyond that recommendation.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>This decision has unfortunate consequences of which we are aware. For example, the 40<sup>th</sup><span>Â </span>Undergraduate Research Symposium on March 27, one of Easternâs signature events, has been canceled. We are assessing whether it can be rescheduled for a later date, but as you know the environment as it relates to COVID-19 remains fluid. We understand and share in the disappointment of participating students and faculty. We understand many students have questions â including<span>Â </span></span><span>honors and LBC6 credits for graduating. We are working to get answers as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>PREVENTION</span></span></strong></p>

<p>To the Eastern Michigan University community:</p>
<p>Today we made several important decisions regarding University operations in light of the ongoing spread of<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 (new<span>Â </span><span>coronavirus</span>) and Governor Whitmerâs declaration of a state of emergency in the State of Michigan. There remain no known cases at this time of<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 on our campus or among the Eastern Michigan University community.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Out of an abundance of caution, we are announcing the following actions:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classes and instruction</span></strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Effective tomorrow, March 12, we are suspending face-to-face instruction in lectures, seminars and other similar classroom settings. The suspension of on campus/in person classes will last through Tuesday, March 31 -- with on campus/in person classes tentatively set to resume on April 1. This decision and timing will be reevaluated on an ongoing basis and may be modified as more information becomes available.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Current classes that are presented in an online format will continue as scheduled.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The University is working to move on-campus classes to a virtual/online instruction format.<span>Â </span><strong>On Monday, March 16, the University will transition classes to a virtual/online format</strong>. Instructors will contact their students with the online class plan.<br><br>
</li>
<li>We are working with faculty and staff who conduct performance and laboratory classes to determine the best approach for those classes, and will provide further guidance next week. This is an evolving process and I ask for your patience as we work through these items.Â <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span>Halle</span><span>Â </span>Library will remain open with reduced hours beginning on Monday.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Residence halls</span></strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>While completing classes virtually, students are encouraged to return to their permanent place of residence due to public health recommendations for social distancing.Â <br><br>
</li>
<li>For students who choose to continue living on campus or are not able to return home, the Universityâs residence halls and dining facilities will remain open. Students who stay on campus<span>Â </span><a href="https://emich.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/AA077DB5/5/6/Home-Portal_Home_Page?UrlToken=F6AF20B9" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://emich.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/AA077DB5/5/6/Home-Portal_Home_Page?UrlToken%3DF6AF20B9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584046847240000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFK7zAeamwrcWl8RYYiJ07VCgK90w">must register online</a><span>Â </span>by Saturday, March 14, so the University can appropriately prepare and staff residence halls and dining facilities.<br><br>
</li>
<li>We urge all students to make the choice that is best for their own personal situations.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Everyone is encouraged to practice appropriate social distancing and enhanced preventative public health and hygiene measures, as we have previously shared in our campus communications.<span>Â </span><span>Â </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Employees</span></strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Certain designated personnel, as notified by their supervisors, may be required to work in the period between Thursday, March 12 and Sunday, March 15.Â All other employees should plan not to work and remain at home Thursday through SundayÂ to allow for greater attention to campus-wide cleaning initiatives and transition to online instruction.Â <br><br>
</li>
<li>As of Monday, March 16, all employees, other than certain designated personnel notified by their supervisors, will be expected to workÂ remotely through Sunday, March 29 and return to work on Monday, March 30, 2020. Employees can return to campus to retrieve computers and necessary materials on Monday, March 16.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Events</span></strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><span>Governor<span>Â </span><span>Whitmer</span><span>Â </span>today announced recommendations to cancel large events or gatherings of people.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span>Following that recommendation, all University events are canceled through the end of March. This includes tomorrow's (March 12) ribbon cutting for the new Campus Wellness Center and weekend events.<br><br></span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;"><li><span>We have suspended scheduling any new events for the immediate future.Â Of course, we will continue to reassess this decision as the situation unfolds.</span></li></ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Travel</span></strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>
<strong><span>All University-related travel to international destinations is now suspended</span></strong><span>. This is a change to our previous announcement suspending only travel to countries with Level Three and Level Four travel advisories.<br><br></span>
</li>
<li><span>All non-essential University travel to domestic locations is also suspended. Any domestic travel requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Office of the Provost and the CFO.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prevention</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, the Centers for Disease Control recommends practicing these good prevention strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash or cough into your elbow if you donât have a tissue.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span><span></span></span>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand<span>Â </span><span>sanitizer</span><span>Â </span>with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next steps</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I understand many of you will have questions about these actions and decisions. We are not going to have an answer right away for all questions, but you can be assured we are working through these issues as quickly as we can.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every step we take and decision we make is focused on this overarching priority:Â protecting the health and safety of our campus community and guests to our campus.Â Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to move to online instruction was made with great consideration. The objective is to minimize gatherings of large groups and avoid extended time in close proximity with one another in classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings. Our actions are consistent with the recommendations of local, state and federal health officials on how to limit the spread of<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is no question that moving to online delivery of a broad array of classes and programs is a challenging undertaking. Our teams have been preparing for this possibility and we have confidence we will be ready to expand our online offerings on Monday, March 16, as noted above. That doesnât mean all will be smooth sailing. This is a complex process -- changes and modifications to these plans as likely as we proceed. Your understanding and cooperation as we work through these matters is greatly appreciated.Â Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to be in very close and regular contact with public health officials at the County and State, and are closely monitoring the Centers for Disease Control guidance on the evolving situation.<span>Â </span>We will reevaluate our actions on an ongoing basis and share updates or modifications as more information becomes available.Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I want to thank our deans and faculty leadership for their guidance and involvement, as well as all of our faculty, staff and students. These campus leaders are often at the forefront, hearing the concerns of our colleagues and fellow students, and we appreciate that they continue to bring these concerns forward so that any issues can be appropriately addressed.Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The<span>Â </span><span>COVID</span>-19 situation is evolving daily.<span>Â </span>This is a difficult time for us all and for many around the world, but we will work together and get through it. Please keep those affected by the virus in your thoughts, as well as those students, faculty and staff who may have loved ones in states or nations where the outbreak is more severe.Â </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>University email is the official form of communication with students, faculty and staff â and you are expected to monitor it for<span>Â </span><span>updates</span></strong>. Please continue to check the<a href="/coronavirus/index.php" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/index.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584046847240000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOztBYTRxkhISOSUp04cvkfM0YDw"><span>Â </span>Eastern Michigan University<span>Â </span><span>Coronavirus</span><span>Â </span><span>website</span></a><span>Â </span>for further information.Â Â </p>

<p>11:15 p.m.</p>
<p>We learnedÂ late tonight that State officials have identified the first cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus) in Michigan. Our understanding is that there are two cases, neither case is in Washtenaw County, the patients are under medical care, and that the State is completing the re-tracing process to assess how these individuals were infected. There is no indication that either of these cases have any connection to EMU's campus.</p>
<p>As we have shared in communications on this topic, the University has been constantly monitoring this situation,Â closely following guidance from the CDC,Â and is in regular contact with our public health and medical partners. This situation has been, and will continue to be, fluid. We understand, however, thatÂ itÂ creates significant concern for many members of our community.</p>
<p>We have developed a variety of plans based on different scenarios. Please understand that some decisions about next steps may need to be made quickly. If that occurs, we will notify all campus partners as quickly as possible. We appreciate your cooperation as we navigate this rapidly-evolving situation.Â Â </p>
<p>We expect to announce some changes tomorrow regarding the ability of instructors to voluntarily teach their classes remotely.Â Also, as a reminder,Â we have undertaken a variety of enhanced cleaning procedures across campus in an effort to ensure the health and safety of the campus community. These measures include: enhanced cleaning of touch points (e.g., light switches, door handles) in common areas; enhanced power-washing and/or electrostatic disinfectant spray in public restrooms; increased frequency of cleaning of shared restrooms in residence halls with shared restrooms; and enhanced access to hand sanitizer, wipes, etc. We have additional steps we intend to take that we will announce and implement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Again, we will keep you informed as much and as quickly as possible. We appreciate your cooperation and patience.</p>

<p>Students, faculty and staff:</p>
<p>Today the Center for Disease Control (CDC) updated its guidance for people who visited countries designated as Level Three due to Coronavirus. Under the new guidance, individuals returning from Level Three countries, even if showing no symptoms of the illness, are advised to <strong>self-quarantine</strong> for 14 days after returning from that country. For Eastern Michigan University, this change is relevant to our students and instructors who recently returned from Italy. The earlier guidance was to self-monitor and resume normal activities as long as an individual was without symptoms. Today the guidance for those same individuals is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>self-quarantine</strong></span>. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, instructors and students returning from Italy must now <strong>self-quarantine for 14 days after their return from the country</strong>. Eastern will follow this directive with regard to any other trip -- all members of our University community returning from a country designated as Level Three or higher due to the Coronavirus must self-quarantine for 14 days after their return.</p>
<p>According to the CDC: "Quarantine in general means the separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease." The students and instructors returning from Italy are being notified of this change today and can return to campus on Sunday, March 15 as long as they show no symptoms of the illness.</p>
<p>As we have indicated from the outset, information and guidance surrounding the spread of the Coronavirus is fluid and is changing rapidly. In some cases, such as this, CDC guidance changes overnight. Our team continues to be in close contact with the Washtenaw County Health Department and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and we are closely monitoring all available federal, state and local information and updates regarding Coronavirus.</p>
<p>As a reminder, there are <strong>no reported cases at Eastern or in Michigan at this time</strong>. We are taking these precautions to ensure the continued health, safety and well being of our students, faculty and staff. Normal University operations continue, and there are no current plans to cancel main campus classes.</p>
<p>The University remains committed to sharing information with our campus community in a timely way to ensure the safety and well being of everyone on our campus and community. Further information and resources can be found at Eastern's <a title="Go to EMU's Coronavirus information website" href="/coronavirus/index.php" target="_blank">Coronavirus information website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a title="Go to CDC Travel Health Notices webpage" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" target="_blank">CDC's Travel Health Notices</a> are posted on its website.</p>
<p>The Eastern Michigan team monitoring this ongoing and evolving situation includes the Office of the President, the Provost's office, the Dean of Students, and Academic Programs Abroad, among others. The University will continue to closely follow all advisories and guidance and advise the campus community as necessary.</p>

The University community will be notified if there isÂ any immediate health threat.</p>
<p><strong>There are no reported cases at Eastern or in Michigan at this time</strong>. We are taking multiple precautions to ensure the continued health, safety and well being of our students, faculty and staff. Normal University operations continue, and there are no current plans to cancel main campus classes. The University is committed to sharing important updates to keep students, faculty and staff safe and informed. Information and resources can be found at our <a href="/coronavirus/index.php">Coronavirus information website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Travel restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Pursuant to existing practice, the University is suspending all University sanctioned travel to countries that have level three or level four travel advisories as reported by the U.S. State Department. The list is updated regularly on the <a title="Go to State Department Travel Advisories" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/" target="_blank">State Department Travel Advisory website</a>.</p>
<p>Following careful review of guidance from the U.S. Department of State, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO), and out of an abundance of caution, the University is implementing the following updates to travel restrictions:</p>
<ul><ul><ul>
<li>All future University-affiliated travel to China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran is suspended, effective immediately.</li>
<li>The University strongly recommends that all students, faculty and staff avoid all personal travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea.</li>
<li>Any member of the University community who travels to or from China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea is required to self-identify prior to returning to campus and must self-monitor for 14 days. Students, faculty and staff returning from these countries must contact the Dean of Students office atÂ <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c5951496358595d52535a4f4849585952484f7c5951555f5412595849034f495e56595f4801"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f6939b83a99293979899908582839293988285b6939b9f959ed8939283">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>. The University needs a single point of contact with county, state and federal agencies to coordinate and track information on behalf of the Provostâs office.</li>
<li>Public health advisories and health precautions can change with little notice. Current guidance is country-specific. Students, faculty and staff returning from Italy who are symptom free must self-monitor but can attend class. Students, faculty and staff who exhibit any of the symptoms described below should not attend class and observe government guidance regarding self-quarantine, along with notifying the Dean of Students.</li>
<li>Students, faculty and staff returning from South Korea must self-quarantine for 14 days per CDC guidance.</li>
<li>If after reviewing health-related guidelines, any instructor who needs to consult about accommodations should email the Provostâs office for further guidance atÂ <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#21444c5451534e574e525561444c4842490f444554"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0461697174766b726b77704461696d676c2a616071">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>.</li>
</ul></ul></ul>
<p>Â </p>
<p><br>In addition to these travel restrictions andÂ previously announced actions, the University is implementing the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study abroad programs in China, Italy and South Korea, scheduled to begin later this semester through the end of summer, have been suspended, effective immediately.</li>
<li>The University is communicating directly with students who are currently out of the country on study abroad programs to ensure their safe return to the U.S. and to minimize disruption to their academic studies.</li>
<li>The Study Abroad office continues to work directly with students enrolled in global academic programs. Study abroad students who have questions should emailÂ <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6e1e1c01091c0f031d400f0c1c010f0a2e0b03070d06400b0a1b511d1b0c040b0d1a533d1a1b0a174b5c5e2f0c1c010f0a4b5c5e3f1b0b1d1a070100"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c2b2b0ada5b0a3afb1eca3a0b0ada3a682a7afaba1aaec">[emailÂ protected]</span> edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>Coronavirus symptoms</strong></p>
<p>As a reminder, relevantÂ signs of the virus includeÂ a cough, fever greater than 100.4 degrees and shortness of breath. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should stay away from campus and contact their medical provider or the<a title="Go to IHA Health Center website" href="https://ihacares.com/locations/mi/ypsilanti/iha-urgent-care-@-emu" target="_blank">Â IHA Health Center @ EMU</a> atÂ 734.896.4110Â to speak to medical personnel who can assess and guide next steps. In addition, they should notifyÂ the Dean of StudentsÂ atÂ <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d1b4bca48eb5b4b0bfbeb7a2a5a4b5b4bfa5a291b4bcb8b2b9ffb4b5a4eea2a4b3bbb4b2a5ec92bea3bebfb0a7b8a3a4a2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="16737b6349727377787970656263727378626556737b7f757e38737263">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>General advisories for student, faculty and staff travelers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone planning international travel should check the status ofÂ COVID-19 alerts and precautionsÂ at all destinations, including layovers, and continue to do so until their return to the U.S.</li>
<li>Monitor travel advisories daily, including potential restrictions on border crossings; countries you visit may decide to implement travel restrictions with very little notice, impacting your ability to return to campus.</li>
<li>Airlines may cancel/limit flights in or out of a country or region.</li>
<li>Additional quarantine measures may be applied by the U.S. and other countries.</li>
<li>Re-entry to the U.S. could be restricted â some areas are posting a 14-day self-isolation requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>Safeguards regarding the spread of Coronavirus</strong></p>
<p>Person-to-person spread of the Coronavirus in the United States has been detected. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. Practice these good prevention strategies:Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer if you donât have soap and water.</li>
<li>Cover coughs with your elbow and sleeve.</li>
<li>Stay away from others if you or they are sick.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>The Washtenaw County Health Department has prepared <a title="Go to Washtenaw County Health Department Coronavirus Information" href="https://www.washtenaw.org/DocumentCenter/View/15099/Novel-Coronavirus-COVID-19PDF" target="_blank">background information and frequently asked questions [PDF]</a> to better inform the public about Coronavirus. In addition, the health information office at <a title="Go to UC Davis video about Coronavirus" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLpOe4-ucc&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">UC Davis produced a helpful video about Coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>A reminder:Â anyone experiencing symptoms should contact their health provider or the <a title="Go to IHA Health Center website" href="https://ihacares.com/locations/mi/ypsilanti/iha-urgent-care-@-emu" target="_blank">IHA Health Center @ EMU</a> atÂ 734.896.4110Â to speak to medical personnel who can assess and guide your next steps.</p>
<p><strong>University encourages use of sanitizers, disinfectant wipes</strong></p>
<p>Effective immediately, the University has approved the use of p-cards for the purchase of hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes to use in classrooms, offices and other public spaces, and encourages all employees to use them daily to wipe down frequently touched surfaces such as door and drawer handles.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor this evolving situation and provide further updates as warranted.</p>

<h3>A message for you from EMU Dean of Students and OISS about the coronavirus outbreak</h3>
</td>
<span class="visuallyhidden">Expand dropdown</span><div id="d30e90-31" class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><td style="width: 80%;">
<p>Dear International Students from China,</p>
<p>Last Friday, you received an email from EMU President Smith about the recent Novel Coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. We want to reinforce to you that the University is closely monitoring this outbreak and is following the recommendations of the <a title="Go to the CDC site." href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, as well as the <a title="Go to the WHO site." href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>.</p>
<p>Health officials and administrators throughout the University will continue to work closely with the <a title="Go to the Washtenaw County Health Department site." href="https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=800" target="_blank">Washtenaw County Health Department</a> to prepare for, screen and prevent the spread of illness. As this situation continues to develop, we will provide updates and information to help you stay healthy.</p>
<p>We wanted to reassure you that Eastern Michigan University has systems in place to monitor, identify and respond swiftly to any potential case of coronavirus. For now, it is important to know when and how to access care:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have traveled from China or a surrounding Asian countryÂ â or have been in contact with someone who hasÂ â within the past 14 days and you subsequently develop a cough, fever greater than 100.4 degrees and shortness of breath, you will need to seek medical attention.</li>
<li>Call the <a title="Go to the IHA site." href="https://ihacares.com/locations/mi/ypsilanti/iha-urgent-care-@-emu" target="_blank">IHA Health Center @ EMU</a> at <a href="tel:+1-734-896-4110">734.896.4110</a> to speak to medical personnel who can assess and guide your next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we are also at the height of the influenza season, here are some tips to decrease your risk of contracting influenza of which we are seeing many active cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get vaccinated against influenza! It is not too late. As in other years, the coverage is not 100 percent effective, but it can reduce symptoms for those who do become infected and decrease the risk of severe complications. Your flu shot is covered by the <a title="Go to the EMU Student Insurance policy page." href="/uhs/student-insurance/index.php">EMU Student Insurance policy</a>.</li>
<li>Wash your hands frequently for 20 seconds or more with soapy water and donât touch your face.</li>
<li>If you are sick, do not go to classes, cover your cough and seek help, especially with severe symptoms or if you are at high risk for complications due to such conditions as asthma or diabetes.</li>
<li>Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with saliva, whether in your living or social environments.</li>
<li>Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.</li>
<li>Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to ensure a healthy immune system.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recognize that many of our students and employees are natives of China and/or have family and friends in the country and may be concerned about their well-being. Please know that the University community supports and cares about you, and we send our best wishes for the health of your loved ones.</p>
<p>Two offices on campus, in particular, can serve as helpful resources should you find yourself in need of support. You may call <a title="Go to the CAPS site." href="https://www.emich.edu/caps/index.php" target="_blank">Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</a> at <a href="tel:+1-734-487-1118">734.487.1118</a> if you would like to speak to a counselor. For other assistance, consider talking with a staff member at the <a title="Go to the OISS site." href="/oiss/index.php" target="_blank">Office for International Students and Scholars (OISS)</a> at <a href="tel:+1-734-487-3116">734.487.3116</a> or by stopping in the Office at 240 Student Center.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ellen Gold<br>Assistant Vice President for Student AffairsÂ and Dean of Students</p>
<p>Esther Gunel<br>Director of the Office for International Students and ScholarsÂ  Â </p>

<h3>Coronavirus update</h3>

<span class="visuallyhidden">Expand dropdown</span><div id="d30e90-32" class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><td style="width: 80%;">
<p>To students, faculty and staff:</p>
<p>The Universityâs leadership team continues to closely monitor escalating global developments regarding the Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the <a title="Go to the WHO site." href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> announced that it has classified Coronavirus as a global health emergency and the U.S. State Department elevated its <a title="Go to the travel site." href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html" target="_blank">China travel advisory</a> to its highest-level warning, Level 4, which recommends a <strong>âDo Not Travelâ to China</strong> due to the illness.</p>
<p>The Eastern Michigan University health and wellness team, under the direction of Dean of Students <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb9e97979e95d59c94979fbb9e96929893d59e9f8ec4888e99919e988fc6">Ellen Gold</a>, is involved in ongoing dialogue with state and local public health officials, primarily the <a title="Go to the Washtenaw County Health Department site." href="https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=800" target="_blank">Washtenaw County Health Department</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that no suspected cases of Coronavirus have been reported on our campus or among any of our students, faculty or staff. No cases have been confirmed in Washtenaw County or in the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>Given the heightened warnings from the WHO and the State Department, we have taken important steps to ensure the safety and well being of our community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student programs with planned travel to China through the end of summer are being assessed, with the possibility of being redirected.</li>
<li>All university-related and university-sponsored travel to China is being suspended for the next two months and will be evaluated on a rolling basis to account for changing developments in the course of the emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our utmost priority is the health, safety and well being of our students, faculty and staff, as well as our neighbors in the greater Ypsilanti and Washtenaw communities. This priority will guide our actions in response to this health emergency in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The Washtenaw County Health Department also reminds us that Coronavirus is a travel-related illness, and not an illness associated with contact with Chinese or Asian community members. The Health Department states, âLetâs fight this public health concern with compassion and science, not fear and discrimination.â</p>
<p>The Washtenaw County Health Department has prepared <a title="Download the FAQ [PDF]." href="https://www.washtenaw.org/DocumentCenter/View/15099/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-nCoVPDF" target="_blank">background information and Frequently Asked Questions [PDF]</a> to better inform the public about Coronavirus.</p>
<p>We will provide further updates as necessary.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>James M. Smith, Ph.D.<br>President</p>
