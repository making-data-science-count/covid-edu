    <em>The District will continue to post updates and information on this site.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>April 17, 2020</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dear Cedar Falls Schools’ Families,</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is with a heavy heart that we share the news that our Governor has decided to shut down schools for the rest of this academic year. We miss all of our students and had hoped we would be able to reunite yet this spring, but the safety of our students, staff and families is far more important.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that we know we will not be reconvening this spring, we are making plans for what that means for the rest of this ‘school year’. Our teachers will continue to reach out to all of their students and continuous learning plans will continue. As further decisions are made, we will communicate those with you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, we thank you and ask for your continued patience, support, and flexibility as we work together to navigate this difficult time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please give our students a hug, from all of the District staff. We know many of our students are hurting. Please know their heartbreak is shared. Our teachers and staff feel this pain too; we miss our students and the chance to come to school together every day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We will get through this difficult time and we will get through this together. Thank you for all of your patience and support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">#TigersTogether</p>
<p>
  <strong>April 2, 2020</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">Per the Governor’s announcement today, Cedar Falls Schools will be closed through April 30. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The district will continue to provide instruction and learning opportunities as we work to clarify details with the Iowa Department of Education. What we are currently experiencing is certainly not what any of us had planned for our students, or for our community, as we looked at this school year. Please know how grateful we are for your continued sacrifice, support and care for one another.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As we move forward with continuous learning opportunities, please remember that your student’s teacher(s) will have the best answers if you have questions about login information or specific assignments. Our teachers are working hard to support our families and students during this time. Teachers will continue to be in contact with their students and work with them to ensure additional opportunities are available.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We know there are academic milestones and other events that our students and families were looking forward to this year and as updates are available, we will share them. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past several weeks, our commitment to the students and the families of Cedar Falls Schools has been paramount and we will continue this commitment through the closure. Together, we will all get through this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the challenges we face today, we remain hopeful for the future because we know that we are surrounded by a community of caring people—those who continue to make a positive difference in the lives of children, youth and families in Cedar Falls no matter what. Whether teaching remotely, serving food curbside, providing access to technology, or helping in countless other ways, in Cedar Falls Schools we always take care of one another and remain committed to doing what is right for our students, staff, and families. #TigersTogether #everystudenteveryday</p>

<p><strong>Playgrounds:</strong> Playground equipment on our school sites are closed. Signs have been posted and city staff will be used to help monitor and enforce. The open park areas will not be closed, only the playground equipment due to the potential of community spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Kindergarten parent meeting</strong> has been postponed, a new date will be announced.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kindergarten Prep registration</strong> will still be due April 15.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary parent/teacher conferences dates</strong> will be canceled. Parents, please contact your student(s)’ teachers to ask questions regarding their education.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>All-City Concerts</strong> have been canceled.</p>
<p><strong>Prom:</strong> the high school is not allowed to host prom on the original date of May 9, so it has been rescheduled to Saturday, May 23. We recognize graduation is scheduled for May 24 and are working through those additional questions and concerns with the rescheduled date.</p>

Thank you to the Hearst Center for making it possible to still share our students' artwork. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Free Grab-n-Go Meals:</strong> due to newly-released USDA guidance, caregivers may pick up meals for children at meal sites, effective immediately. USDA recognizes that in this public health emergency, continuing to require children to come to the meal site to pick up meals may not be practical and in keeping with the goal of providing meals while also taking appropriate safety measures. Meals are offered Monday through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. for anyone 18 and under at these three locations:<br>Holmes Junior High, 505 Holmes Drive, west side of the building<br>North Cedar Elementary, 2419 Fern Avenue<br>Orchard Hill Elementary, 3909 Rownd Street </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>DO NOT come to any buildings if you have a fever greater than 100.4, cough or shortness of breath. </strong>If you do have these symptoms, and cannot send another person in your place, call your student's building for directions. </p>

<p>As you are well aware, the response to COVID-19, the Coronavirus Disease, is constantly evolving. Seemingly with each new development, the need to take further precautions takes another step. With the Governor’s recommendation, all schools in Cedar Falls are closed for students until Monday, April 13, including all activities and athletics, as well as community use and rental of facilities. We understand and appreciate that this decision creates additional challenges for our families. At the same time, we feel compelled to do all that we can to protect the health and safety of our community.<br><br>Our district’s emergency response team will be meeting regularly to address specific items and will continue to share more information, including expectations for staff, food programs, educational support, etc.<br><br>At this time the State’s recommendation to close schools extends until at least April 13. Throughout the coming weeks, we will continue to provide information about the plans for the reopening of our schools, including our plans regarding activities and athletics.<br><br>We continue to appreciate your support and understanding during this incredibly unique and uncertain time in our history.<br><br>If there is something you need from us, please do not hesitate to reach out, and we will do what we can to support you and your family. We will continue to provide updates through our messaging system, website, and social media.</p>

<p>As we near Spring Break scheduled from March 14-22, Cedar Falls Community School District (CFCSD) continues to follow the global outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus. Many staff and families may have planned trips out of state or even out of the country, which could impact the spread of the virus.<br><br>As of March 10, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identified four countries around the world as being at high risk for the spread of Coronavirus: China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea.<br><br>The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) recommends that anyone who visits those countries voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days upon their return.<br><br>Families who plan to travel to any of these areas should notify their school to make arrangements for the student’s re-entry to school. In addition, families who visit any destination the CDC has identified as high risk for Coronavirus should follow its <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584461002243000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoiThxtb9h04ok-RMPs9p4GCMgTw" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" target="_blank">public health recommendations</a>.<br><br>There are currently no other travel advisories or restrictions pertaining to Coronavirus, either internationally or within the United States. However, at this time, Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in nearly 100 countries and 35 states, including Iowa. Before traveling, be sure to stay informed.<br><br>This is a fluid situation and although we do not have all the answers right now, we will continue to stay in communication.</p>
