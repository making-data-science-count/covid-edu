					We have received word from the New York State Department of Education that due to the closure of schools the deadline for parental requests for transportation to charter and nonpublic schools for next school year has been extended to April 15, 2020.
					<a href="/district/forms/rft/">
						Please see additional information regarding this extension on this page.
					</a></p>
<p>
					Just as a reminder the food pantry is open tomorrow from 10am-12pm at Wisdom Lane Middle School. Island Harvest will also be there distributing perishable meals to families. As another reminder breakfast and lunch are distributed to students who need them at Salk Middle School on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12pm-3pm.

					We have heard from some of our vendors about scams in which individuals are attempting to contact families, saying that they owe money for school items, such as yearbooks and class rings.
					<strong>
						Please do not provide any credit card information over the phone.

					We hope you are doing well today. We have now learned that the Governor has closed schools up to April 15th. Since this falls during our Spring break, our schools will plan to open on April 20th, assuming that there are no further Executive Orders issued by the Governor. Remote learning will not take place during the scheduled Spring break (April 9-April 17). Of course we will be in touch with you if any of this changes.
				</p>
<p>
					We have received many questions about how 3rd quarter averages will be calculated for students in grades 6-12. Teachers will use grades that were from assignments and assessments that were administered prior to the closing of the district on March 13th. Teachers may use grades from online assignments, postings and assessments only if they improve a student's overall average. Students who are missing work from prior to March 13th should contact the classroom teacher to receive information about how to make up that work.
				</p>
<p>
					The third quarter for middle and high school students ends Friday, April 3rd. We do expect a slight delay in the posting of final third quarter averages. We will send an additional message with the new date.
				</p>
<p>
					Some people have inquired as to our plan for 4th quarter averages. Since the 4th quarter only begins on April 6th, we are going to wait a little longer before we finalize those plans.
				</p>
<p>
					2nd Trimester grades for elementary students will be available the week of April 6th.
				</p>
<p>
					For parents who are first responders or critical health care workers, please see the information on our website regarding free child care for your children.

					Please know we continue to keep you and your family in our thoughts and we hope you have a wonderful weekend.

					Dear Students,
				</p>
<p>
					We have been thinking about you and how you are doing.  We can't wait until you are back in our buildings.  They are not the same without you.
				</p>
<p>
					As you continue to work on your assignments, please know that we are only looking for you to do your best. We know that this is not what you are used to, but you are doing great and we are very proud of you.
				</p>
<p>
					Remember to get up and get some fresh air. The weather is getting better and there's nothing like sunshine to lift your mood.
				</p>
<p>
					Dear Parents and Guardians,
				</p>
<p>
					Please remember that our food service is available again on Thursday at Salk from 12 - 3, if you are in need. Also our food pantry at Wisdom Lane will be open next on Thursday from 5pm - 7pm.  Our Board members have been working to make sure that all who need food can get it.
				</p>
<p>
					This is a stressful time for us all.  If your child is experiencing anxiety, please feel free to use the resources we have on our website for social emotional learning.  These can be found on our Coronavirus resource page, along with other helpful links.
				</p>
<p>
					We want to balance our desire to keep you informed with our realization that a call every evening might become intrusive,  therefore, unless there is an important message, you may not hear from us on this issue on a regular basis.  We will be updating our website regularly, so please do check for updates.  Contact information is also listed there for your use.
				</p>
<p>
					Be safe and healthy.

						CORONAVIRUS IN OUR COMMUNITY
					</strong><br>
					We are beginning to hear of a few self-reported cases of individuals testing positive for the Coronavirus.  We have been in contact with the NYS and County Departments of Health and have been told that at this point, there is no reason to panic as schools have already been closed for 10 days,  As you know, the scientific community has said that the maximum incubation period for this virus is 14 days.  That puts us 4 days away from any possible contact that could have happened in our schools.  Given the executive order by our Governor and the order by our County Executive, everyone should be self-quarantined at this point.  If anyone has symptoms, such as a cough or a fever of at least 100.4 degrees they should contact their doctor and follow his or her directions.
				</p>
<p>
					We continue to think about our school community and are here to help if you are in need.  You may reach us by using  the contact sheet which is on our Coronavirus resource page, or by clicking on individuals listed under "faculty and staff" on each of the schools' pages.
				</p>
<p>
					We hope that you stay safe and healthy during this trying time.

Edmodo is working to resolve this issue.  For now, a suggestion would be to have your child log in a little later in the day - perhaps around lunch time.  Just because assignments are posted at 10am, it does not mean that they need to be completed immediately.

						REMOTE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES
						<br></strong>
					Thank you for your continued patience, flexibility and understanding.  Our commitment to our students' well-being is first and foremost.  As you know, we are in the process of transitioning our learning opportunities for our students onto the Edmodo platform.  Our staff has been working tirelessly to ensure learning opportunities will be continued for our students, although we all know that remote learning can never take the place of a teacher.  This is a measure devised to keep students' minds engaged until schools reopen.  We have done our best to devise lessons that are not overly burdensome.  If your child would like additional work for enrichment, please have them contact their teacher through Edmodo.
				</p>
<p>
					By 10am Wednesday, all teachers will have their Edmodo virtual classrooms established. Students should log in on school days after 10am to complete the lessons posted by their teachers. If you have questions about Edmodo classes, please email your child's teacher. Teachers will be available to answer questions during the hours of the regular school day.  Students receiving services such as speech or counseling, will receive a separate class code to join on the Edmodo site.  Please note that specific instructions must be followed for families who will be using a single device for multiple students.  That information is on our coronavirus resource page.
				</p>
<p>
					Parents of students in grades K-5 will receive a letter in the mail with their child's log in information.   If you have not received this letter by Friday, please email your school's principal. If you have a child in the middle or high school, who does not know their log in information, please email your school's principal.

As you know, the Governor has suspended in-person instruction and extra curricular activities, including sports as a result of concerns over the spread of the coronavirus (Covid 19).  The Board of Education and District Administration are united in working towards providing support to our school families at this difficult time.
				</p>
<p><strong>
						FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH
					</strong><br>
					Families who are eligible for the free and reduced price meal program are encouraged to participate in our meal pick up program, which will begin on Tuesday March 17th.  Grab and go meals (Breakfast and Lunch) will be available every Tuesday and Thursday from 12PM to 3PM at Salk Middle School in the back parking lot by the cafeteria.  Every Tuesday, students will be able to pick up two days of meals and every Thursday there will be 3 days of meals available.  This will continue for the duration of the suspension of in-person instruction as mandated by our Governor.  We will also have free/reduced applications available for those whose financial situation has changed due to the current COVID-19 health emergency. To protect the safety of all families, as well as our staff who are distributing the meals, families are asked to remain in their vehicles for passenger window delivery. As we must track the meals served in accordance with our normal school lunch service, families will be asked to provide the student ID number before service.
					If you are in need of food from our food pantry, please contact the main office at Wisdom Lane.  Conversely, if you are able to donate food, you may also contact Wisdom to set up a time to drop it off.
				</p>
<p><strong>
						CHILD CARE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AND CRITICAL HEALTH CARE WORKERS:
					</strong><br>
					The Governor has tasked us to provide child care for our first responders and critical health care workers.  We are happy to support our community in this way.  If you fall into this category of workers and are in need of child care, please contact your child's school Wednesday, March 18th by 1 pm. We will compile a list and get back to you as soon as we can with details.
				</p>
<p><strong>
						ACCESS TO SCHOOL BUILDINGS
					</strong><br>
					Your child's principal will be sending out an automated call on Tuesday, March 17th (tomorrow), advising you of the schedule they have set up so that students can pick up essential items they may need during this time.  You should receive this call by 12:00 noon.  This information will also be posted on the schools' webpage after 12:00 noon.
				</p>
<p>
					If you have provided a supply of medication for your child to be stored in our buildings, please be advised that the school nurse will contact you tomorrow (March 17th).  If you do not receive a call, please contact the nurse directly.

						REMOTE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES
					</strong><br>
					The District continues to work with teachers to develop remote learning opportunities during the time that in-person instruction has been suspended by the Governor.  While many teachers have already begun posting assignments, we expect that all teachers will have remote learning opportunities posted by the end of the week.     You will receive a Connect-Ed call by Wednesday, March 18th, providing further information about how to access your child's virtual classrooms.  This message will also provide information for students who are having trouble accessing virtual resources.  However if you already know that you are having difficulty with access, please contact your school for assistance, beginning on Tuesday, March 17th, so that we can begin troubleshooting for your child.

					Schools are in the process of being thoroughly cleaned today and Monday in accordance with CDC regulations. Our current plan is to close school for students on Tuesday, March 17th in order to meet with teachers to ensure they have all of the necessary resources to provide remote learning opportunities in the event of a long term closure. This means students will return to school on Wednesday, March 18th.  All activities between Friday March 13th through Tuesday March 17th are canceled, including our Saturday Dance program.
				</p>
<p>
					Please know that we continue to be in contact with the Department of Health and will update you as necessary, following their guidance.
				</p>
<p>
					As always the safety and wellbeing of our school community is our utmost priority. We appreciate your understanding during this challenging time.

						Coronavirus Update: (03/12/2020)
					</h3>
</div>
<p>
					We have been notified by the Nassau County Department of Health that a GC Tech staff member has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). As mandated by the New York State Health Department, GC Tech will be closed on Friday, March 13 and Monday, March 16.
				</p>
<p>
					Since GC Tech is located at Levittown Memorial, and our students attend this program, the Levittown School District will also close all district schools on Friday and Monday out of an abundance of caution to clean and disinfect all of our schools.
				</p>
<p>
					Please note that although this individual is not a Levittown Employee, we feel strongly that this is a prudent course of action.
				</p>
<p>
					Since we did not use any snow days this winter, these two days will be counted as snow days and instruction will resume on Tuesday, March 17th.  Therefore, we will have school on Friday, May 22nd.
				</p>
<p style="color: #d90000; font-weight: bold;">
					As Friday March 13th and Monday March 16th are considered as snow days, there is no requirement for teachers or students to log into Edmodo for remote learning. If a long term closure becomes necessary we will provide additional information regarding remote learning.
