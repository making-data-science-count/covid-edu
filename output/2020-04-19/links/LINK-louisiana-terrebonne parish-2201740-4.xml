Please call the Council on Aging at 985-868-8411, then dial 0 for assistance. Because of a large number of calls, seniors may be asked to leave their name and phone number and a Council on Aging staff member will return their call as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Terrebonne Council on Aging (TCOA) has implemented the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>All local senior centers and lunch centers have been closed until further notice.</li>
<li>All home visits by TCOA have been cancelled.</li>
<li>Senior citizens who receive home delivered meals will continue to receive home delivered meals and all senior citizens who utilized the senior centers and lunch centers for meals and are in need of meals will be added to the home delivery list to receive meals.</li>
<li>All senior center and lunch center managers will conduct check-up calls to registered senior citizens every other day.</li>
<li>All information and assistance requests will be conducted via telephone. If a senior citizen needs information or assistance, they should call the Council on Aging office at 985-868-8411.</li>
<li>All assessments for senior citizens will be conducted by telephone.</li>

<p><u>Disinfecting of Gas Pump Handles</u></p>
<p>Parish President Gordon Dove would like to remind convenience stores, retail stores with gas stations and self-serve gas stations to regularly disinfect gas pump handles with a disinfectant solution. He also would like to remind citizens to use a disinfectant wipe, paper towel or other item to hold the gas pump handle and to use hand sanitizer or wash your hands with soap and water after pumping gas.</p>
<p>Everyone should continue to practice social distancing. You may have coronavirus with no symptoms (asymptomatic) and spread the virus to others or others that think they do not have coronavirus because they do not have symptoms may spread it to you. Please stay at home unless you need essential items and do not visit family or friends unless necessary.</p>
<p>Do your part, wash your hands, cough or sneeze into the crease of your elbow, stay at home, stop the spread, flatten the curve.</p>
<p><u>Requirement of Hand Sanitizer and Disinfectant Procedures for Retail Stores</u></p>
<p>Parish President Gordon Dove is requiring that convenience stores, gas stations, dollar stores, truck stops, seafood markets and all retail stores have hand sanitizer available to customers as they enter the store. Businesses are also required to disinfect all surfaces that customers may have contact with, such as door handles, cooler door handles, and other self-service vending items to be disinfected on a regular basis. Businesses should continue to practice the required social distancing between customers and employees.</p>
<p><u>Closure of Gas Stations, Truck Stops and Convenience Stores at 10 p.m.</u></p>
<p>By executive order, Parish President Gordon Dove has ordered that all gas stations, truck stops and convenience stores to close at 10 p.m. and may reopen at 5 a.m. Those gas stations, truck stops and gas stations with “pay at the pump” capabilities can continue to sell fuel after 10 p.m.</p>
<p><u>24-Hr Pharmacy Operations</u></p>
<p>Only pharmacies with drive thru window capability can remain open 24-hrs with drive thru operations only. All other pharmacies must close the store to customers by 10 p.m. and may reopen at 5 a.m.</p>
<p><u>Terrebonne Parish Assessor’s Office</u></p>
<p>The Terrebonne Parish Assessor’s Office hours are from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Thursday. The office will be closed on Fridays. These hours will be in effect till the end of April.</p>
<p><u>City Court of Houma Information</u></p>
<p>Per the Louisiana Supreme Court’s order dated April 6, 2020 and the Governor’s Proclamation dated April 2, 2020, City Court of Houma has suspended all civil trials, hearings and court appearances until no earlier than May 4, 2020.

<p><u>Bounce Houses and Water Slides Use Prohibited</u></p>
<p>Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government is prohibiting the rental of bounce houses and water slides. Companies that rent these items are not essential businesses as per Governor Edwards executive order or the US Department of Homeland Security CISA guidelines. The use of bounce houses and water slides encourage gatherings of people and does not promote social distancing, increasing the risk of spreading the coronavirus.</p>

Customers wishing to pay their utility bills should use the drive thru service, Monday thru Thursday, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Utility bills may also be paid online at <a href="http://www.mytpcg.org">www.mytpcg.org</a> or by telephone by calling 844-331-8341.</p>
<p><u>2020 Census</u></p>
<p>Getting an accurate census count is essential for the parish. The census determines the allocation of representatives to serve in the legislative bodies of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Louisiana State Legislature, and within voting districts.

<p>One hour before our normal distribution times, those in need may line up in their vehicles on Commerce Street entering from Lafayette Street. Vehicles will need to line up on the extreme right side of Commerce Street. We ask that vehicles pull all the way up to the stop sign at intersection of Church Street and Commerce street. Once the process begins, a screener will approach your vehicle and ask you a few questions though your driver side window. Once the brief screening process is complete you will be asked to pull around to Magnolia Street to a section clearly marked in front of the food bank. Once in that section, you will simply have to unlatch your trunk, and someone will load the food items in your trunk and close it. Then you will safely reenter Magnolia Street and exit on Lafayette Street. You will not exit your car at any time though this process. There will be signs providing directions all along the route.</p>
