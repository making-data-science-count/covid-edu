Distance Learning for ALL
<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="distancer" id="distancer"><strong>What about students who are immigrants and/or refugees that might have language barriers at home, how are they being supported? </strong> (April 16)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: First and foremost, the focus needs to be on student and family safety (emotional and physical) and secure access to food and shelter. Additionally, there is a lot of fear and distrust among our immigrant and/or refugee population so it is critical that outreach and contact be initiated by people that are known and trusted within the community. Ideally, this may be a teacher or community liaison.  This includes honoring home language and culture and considering the strengths and needs of students we name in the introduction and in the equity and access section of this guidance. As educators we have now become guests in the homes and communities of the students and families we serve.  We ask that districts work from a place of honoring and harnessing assets including home language, family (siblings and extended family), and culture. And, district leaders should seek out other districts who are doing this well and learn from them. </p>

<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="distanceq" id="distanceq"><strong>Has there been any conversation allowing a very small number of students (who are failing or who do not have phone or internet access) to come to campus? </strong> (April 16)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: We are unable to have any physical interaction with students that may jeopardize health and safety (per OHA). After a review by the Oregon Health Authority (OHA), schools may NOT provide instruction to any K-12 students at physical school sites for any reason or for any duration of time--regardless of size of group or number of students. </p>
<p>
The only exception to this guidance will come in the form of ways districts meet the Executive Order 20-08 to provide child care for front line staff, such as health care workers and emergency responders. Two links are relevant in providing childcare: Temp changes to child care rules and this ELD Toolkit for districts. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Essential Skills and Personalized Learning requirements for the Class of 2021 will be suspended (Career Related Learning Experiences (CRLEs), Extended Application, and Education Plan and Profile). Districts may choose to add local graduation requirements for the class of 2021, including  Personalized Learning requirements. <strong>Note: This will require future State Board of Education action and OAR revision.</strong> </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A:  Yes. Teachers’ professional judgement counts and will be critical to determining student proficiency.  If grading software doesn’t reflect student student learning as of the March 13 date, teachers should make changes with clear notes or documentation to support their determination. </p>

<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="distancem" id="distancem"><strong>What does "pass" mean? should a criteria be set for this as a whole? </strong> (April 16)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p> 
A:  In order to approach student progress with care, connection, and continuity of learning, educators will pursue supportive, flexible options to allow students to demonstrate what they know and can do in reference to Oregon’s standards. See Question #3 for ODE’s Credit Options guidance.  If a teacher determines that a student receives a “Pass”, it means the student meets or exceeds the minimum criteria for learning as established by the teacher. If a student meets or exceeds the minimum criteria for learning as established by the teacher, credit is earned. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: ODE’s guidance will supersede local decision making as authorized by Executive Order 20-08 in response to COVID-19. All of Oregon’s districts will assign Pass/Incomplete to students for any coursework completed during the COVID-19 school closure. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Educators (counselors included) are charged with reaching out to students and families through their districts determined processes. Contact is not limited to use of the internet. Phone calls are encouraged. The key focus is making a connection to each student to ensure they and their family have what they need for food and care with learning to follow while complying with the Stay Home Stay Safe expectations. </p>

<p>
A: This is an option ODE encourages districts to pursue with their local access channels. We are currently researching all of the public television and radio stations to determine how to maximize that as a possible solution. </p>

Graduation Pathways 2020

I must work over the summer and now to support my family financially, how can I get help? </strong> (April 16)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: We know that many high school students have to work right now and into the summer. It will be essential for districts to harness all creative solutions and options to meet students needing to navigate completing school, family safety, and getting basic needs met. Ideas include work-study credit, developing audio recordings or podcasts that could be engaged with while working (if safe to do so), or encouraging and supporting taking the GED for credit. Oregon regulations allow for multiple Credit Options at OAR 581-022-2025, as well, and ODE is making performance assessment materials available for educators to pursue these flexible credit-bearing options on ODE’s Credit Options webpage. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: This crisis illuminates a deeper need to bolster translation services, speed, and quality. Translation services are held and contracted in different ways by ODE and different school districts. In some communities, partnerships with CBOs for translation supports can and should be pursued. Where there are strong and existing contracts with translation service providers, it is a new opportunity for the state and districts to solve how to move more quickly and effectively to provide translations of essential documents. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A:  First and foremost, the focus is student safety and access to food.  Once that is established, districts are encouraged to contact and get expertise from their McKinney-Vento Act liaison. The following resources can also be helpful: </p>
<ul>
<li>Oregon’s regional Continuums of Care are networks of state and local programs assisting community members with housing and other services. </li>
<li>211-Info connects people with social and health services, shelter and transitional housing, food banks and homelessness assistance. </li>
<li>Community Action programs in many areas are providing assistance to families and individuals navigating poverty. </li>
<li>The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness has posted recommendations for planning, preparation and mitigation of coronavirus spread. </li>
<li>School House Connection’s website provides excellent resources for schools and early learning programs to address homelessness during this time. </li>
</ul>
<p>
With regard to instruction and engagement, it will require a collective community and district effort to pursue any and all options to meet students needing to navigate completing school, safety, and getting basic needs met. Ideas include work-study credit, developing audio recordings or podcasts that could be engaged with while working (if safe to do so), or encouraging and supporting taking the GED for credit. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Districts will be  focusing support and effort to ensure students have the greatest access to learning that will allow them to gain credits required for graduation. In this case, the student would need to make up the 10th grade English course. Given the  failing grade and the English credit is required for graduation, the student would need to enroll in credit-recovery or consider an alternate pathway (i.e., flexible Credit Options, additional schooling for the 2020-2021 school year, high school equivalency programs like the GED, etc.). </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Student GPAs will be generated based on the “freezing” of grades as of March 13, following the guidance outlined. The Office of Student Access and Completion (OSAC) is allowing students who would have otherwise raised their cumulative, unweighted GPA to 2.50 or higher to be considered for Oregon Promise as a result of school district actions relative to local or state emergency orders. </p>
<p>
High school registrars will use the GPA verification system and include the students where it would have been mathematically possible to raise their GPA to the 2.50 limit as MET. The deadline to submit GPA verifications is Friday, July 10. </p>
<p>
If a high school does not participate in GPA verification, the high school will need to include a cover letter when providing students with their final high school transcript to submit to OSAC. The cover letter must indicate that it would have been mathematically possible for the student to raise their GPA to the 2.50 limit if they earned letter grades for their final high school term. </p>
<p>
Additionally, encourage all seniors to complete the 2020-21 FAFSA or ORSAA as soon as possible (deadline is June 1 for high school seniors) so they are considered for federal, state and institutional financial aid. The Oregon Promise application deadline is June 1, 2020 for students graduating between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Districts may need to make plans for staff to verify student GPA during summer 2020. School staff can reach out to the staff at OSAC with any questions or for assistance. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Potentially, yes. And, this will likely be true for student transcripts across the nation as nearly every senior is affected by COVID-19 school closuresTranscripts can reflect Pass/Incomplete indicators without having negative impact for students’ future pathway. Districts should consider how they present student transcripts, including the possibility of attaching a letter that indicates the Pass/Incomplete status, as reflective of the COVID-19 school closure. This practice has also been used by districts in the case of closures for natural disasters, such as the New Orleans Hurricane Katrina</p>

<p>
A: Yes, students under this guidance in a trimester system are awarded credits based on prior coursework. However, the grade that is utilized should come from the preceding trimester which would be the 2nd trimester, not the first. In some cases, where coursework is offered in the first and third trimester (skipping the 2nd) then yes, you would use the first trimester grade. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: The senior would not likely pass the course and credit would not be awarded. If the course and/or credit was required for graduation, the student may need to enroll in credit-recovery or consider an alternate pathway (i.e., additional schooling for the 2020-2021 school year, high school equivalency programs like the GED, etc.).  However, in some cases districts may determine that credit should be awarded if there is a larger achievement pattern that deserves consideration. Upon review of the totality of the student’s educational experience, if it is determined that credit is justified, the decision should be supported with documentation. </p>

 </div>
<p>
A: Yes. Here’s a quick distillation of what’s in the full guidance on this subject: </p>

<li>Reach out to students and their families, by April 30, 2020, to affirm Oregon Diploma 2020 credit requirements have been met. Outline a plan to continue senior’s learning and transition to career and college. For seniors on an IEP who are graduating with a regular diploma, this must include notice of termination of IEP services upon commensurate with graduation date or the transition services offered during the closure. Seniors participating in Dual Credit, AP, IB, and other accelerated learning courses should continue and complete these courses to earn the college credit associated with the courses. </li>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: One of the strengths of this question is its attention to learning beyond a grade or a credit. To honor this question, we are giving you our best response, even if not fully satisfying. Learning is our natural state and students at all developmental ages are learners. Grades and credits are proxies for learning. Students enter college coursework in transitions that don’t match their prior knowledge or methods of learning a subject with how the college offers the same or similar content. The transitions required now for the Class of 2020 asks something of all educators, those sending and those receiving, and of the students to focus on what learning they need to make the critical connections and find their way forward.  We also ask community colleges and universities to be creative and caring in addressing the unintended learning gaps that this global crisis is causing. </p>

A: The Office of Student Access and Completion (OSAC) is allowing students who would have otherwise raised their cumulative, unweighted GPA to 2.50 or higher to be considered for Oregon Promise as a result of school district actions relative to local or state emergency orders. The GPA requirement is still a cumulative, unweighted, 2.50 GPA.

<div>
 </div>
<p> 
A: We are not in a position to predict how each institution of higher education will respond or what action they may take. However, we are in conversations with many public universities who are pledging care and support to the Class of 2020. We do anticipate there will be flexibility for seniors from higher education. Additionally, colleges and universities across the country are temporarily updating their admissions requirements to accept  (without disadvantaging students) Pass/No Pass grades in lieu of letter grades for all courses completed while schools are closed. This ensures the health and safety of our communities remains a priority during the COVID-19 response without penalizing students. Institutions of higher education (e.g., Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission, California university and college system, Stanford University, and Harvard University) continue to issue statements outlining these revised admissions policies.

Students Who Experience Disability

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Students protected under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) require further consideration under the law. In determining status towards graduation using the Pass/Incomplete status, districts must consider the additional guidance below to ensure our commitment to equity and access for students with IEPs. </p>
<p>
Seniors with IEPs On Track to Graduate</p>
<ol>
<li>Communicate with the family regarding:
<ul>
<li>Oregon Diploma: Termination of Services</li>
<li>Modified or Extended Diploma: Transition Services offered during closure</li>
<li>Certificate of Completion: Transition Services offered during closure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the student earns an Oregon Diploma, the district’s FAPE obligation to that student will end. The student will no longer receive K-12 educational services, including those prescribed by the IEP. 
<ul><li>If the parent/guardian wants the student to continue to receive special education services through the originally planned graduation date, the IEP team will need to meet to discuss the continued need for special education services pending graduation. Teams can make a decision, with implications for graduation:
<ul>
<li>The student continues to require services and will not graduate at this time. The IEP team must develop a plan to provide credit earning options under Distance Learning for All that enables the student to graduate by August 31, 2020. FAPE must continue to be provided until graduation. </li>
<li>The student no longer requires services and can graduate. Parent retains rights under Procedural Safeguards. </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additional Considerations for Seniors with IEPs who may Need Credits to Graduate</p>
<ol><li>The district must ensure appropriate services and supports were provided before classifying the senior as not on track. At a minimum, this includes:
<ul>
<li>Reviewing IEP records to ensure that district provided FAPE; </li>
<li>Gathering evidence from each teacher/course that an appropriately developed IEP was fully implemented. Such documentation shall include, but is not limited to evidence that all:
<ul>
<li>Specially designed instruction (SDI) was delivered as intended by the IEP team, consistent with the initiation, frequency, and duration required;</li>
<li>Accommodations, related services and supplementary aids and services were delivered as intended by the IEP team; and</li>
<li>Evidence that the IEP team worked towards the measurable annual goals contained within the IEP, including progress monitoring data specific to those goals; and</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensuring that the parent, guardian, or person in a parental relationship was afforded the opportunity to meaningfully participate in the IEP process, including any meetings where student progress towards graduation was reviewed.</li>
</ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
<i>Documentation for requirements in 1a-1c above in which the senior was considered not on track must be provided. If such documentation cannot be provided, the district shall hold that student harmless during the closure.</i> </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A:For students who experience disability and have an IEP, there are several procedural safeguards in place that are protected under federal law. These remain in effect when a district implements “Distance Learning for All”.  The closure of schools and the shift to Distance Learning for All ensures that each district has an obligation to the provisions of FAPE for all students protected under IDEA. This will require strong partnership and flexibility as we all work together to meet the needs of our students during this emergency school closure. </p>

<p>
A: Modified and Extended Diploma options remain available choices for school teams. The Graduation Pathways 2020 guidance includes specific requirements for IEP teams when a student finishes with a modified or extended diploma. Students who are working toward a modified and extended diplomas deserve personalized attention and prioritized support as they may be particularly vulnerable during this time of school closure. </p>

However, if worn by a sick person, particularly with respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, they could reduce the spread of the virus. </p>

<p>
Essential education workers including nutrition personnel and bus drivers should follow more closely to the guidance for healthcare personnel. </p>

<p>
The most effective strategies to prevent infection include the physical distancing measures mandated by the Governor’s Executive Orders, along with basic hand hygiene and cough etiquette. Following CDC recommendations, OHA recognizes that use of cloth face coverings may reduce the spread of virus and help prevent those who have the virus but do not have symptoms from passing it to others. </p>

<p>
Nonetheless, face coverings do NOT change the need to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid all social and recreational activities in which a distance of 6 feet between individuals cannot be maintained;</li>
<li>Maintain at least 6 feet of distance from others during any necessary trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, or healthcare entities; </li>
<li>Cover one’s cough or sneeze with a tissue and discard it immediately; or cough or sneeze into one’s upper sleeve rather than into one’s hands; </li>
<li>Avoid touching one’s eyes, nose, mouth, or face; </li>
<li>Clean your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if handwashing is not possible; and</li>
<li>If sick, isolate oneself and stay away from work, family, and friends until 72 hours after both fever and cough have resolved, without the use of fever-reducing medication. </li>
</ul>
<p>
This guidance is dynamic and evolving; we will continue to provide additional clarity if we learn more about best practices in the workplace or specifically to schools. Here’s CDC guidance dated April 3rd. Here’s OHA guidance issued April 4th. </p>

<div>There are a couple of options for districts to get additional information. The first is the Oregon School Facilities Management Association (OFSMA).

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: First and foremost, the focus needs to be on student and family safety (emotional and physical) and secure access to food and shelter. Additionally, there is a lot of fear and distrust among our immigrant and/or refugee population so it is critical that outreach and contact be initiated by people that are known and trusted within the community. Ideally, this may be a teacher or community liaison.  This includes honoring home language and culture and considering the strengths and needs of students we name in the introduction and in the equity and access section of this guidance. As educators we have now become guests in the homes and communities of the students and families we serve.  We ask that districts work from a place of honoring and harnessing assets including home language, family (siblings and extended family), and culture. And, district leaders should seek out other districts who are doing this well and learn from them. </p>

<p> 
A:  In order to approach student progress with care, connection, and continuity of learning, educators will pursue supportive, flexible options to allow students to demonstrate what they know and can do in reference to Oregon’s standards. See Question #3 for ODE’s Credit Options guidance.  If a teacher determines that a student receives a “Pass”, it means the student meets or exceeds the minimum criteria for learning as established by the teacher.

<p>A: The “Distance Learning for All” Guidance provides a Distance Learning Capacity Framework which is a conceptual framework to help districts assess capacity for distance learning. Remember that distance learning does not always mean online learning. It is designed to provide multiple entry points based on readiness, to inform planning, and to create a trajectory for future progress. We stand at the ready to support your implementation. We understand that every district or community will move at different paces. At ODE, we will meet every district where they are at and ask that you show progress, and make a good faith effort. </p>

<p>A: You will not be asked to submit a written plan and ODE does not intend to collect a plan. We ask that you use the tools provided, assess your starting point, and begin actively implementing what you can by April 13th while continuing to phase in and strengthen what you can offer as resources and conditions allow. We want your efforts focused on doing the best you can to equitably serve your students. We anticipate asking for a user-friendly simple self-report in the upcoming months. </p>

<p>A: The “Distance Learning for All” guidance is intended to support school districts to successfully implement distance learning through a range of effective strategies. ODE recognizes schools are at various entry points in their capacity to provide learning resources for schools and families. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Distance learning does not mean online learning alone. While Distance Learning may include online options for some students, it does not require technology or the internet to result in successful learning. For many of our 197 districts in Oregon, distance learning may not include online experiences. Students engaging in distance learning have access to appropriate educational materials and receive ongoing interaction with their licensed and/or registered teacher(s). It is important to note that distance learning includes multimedia communication and blended learning strategies, not just digital/online learning. Learning may or may not be separated in time (asynchronous vs. synchronous). As schools transition to distance learning, successful approaches will be centered on care and community. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Key elements of distance learning for every student, educator and parent to know: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Every student regularly connects with their teacher(s). </li>
 <li>Teachers and students prioritize time together to focus on the most important or relevant learning. </li>
 <li>Teachers, families, and caregivers work as a team, anchored in partnership. Together, teachers and families co-facilitate learning, design consistent routines, and establish the learning environment. </li>
 <li>Teachers continue to monitor, report and record each student’s progress towards learning goals and standards, encouraging critical problem solving, collaboration, communication and creativity. </li>
 <li>Schools provide multiple, flexible opportunities -- for our high school students in particular – to earn credit on their pathway to graduation. </li>
</ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>As a foundation for successful “Distance Learning for All” our students, our schools have a critical responsibility to: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Continue to focus on student belonging, care, connection, well-being and mental and social-emotional health. </li>
 <li>Actively engage and nurture relationships with students, families, and community. </li>
 <li>Center equity in all outreach and communication efforts with parents and caregivers. </li>
 <li>Encourage, support and provide opportunities for active collaboration and communication between school leaders, teachers and all school staff. </li>

<p>A: The “Distance Learning for All” guidance is meant for alternative education and charter school programs as well. Centering on care and connection while providing learning for each and every learner matters. Alternative education programs and charter schools are generally providing differentiated and unique approaches to learning which can and should be brought forward even while we respond and support learning from a distance. You know your communities best and ODE hopes the guidance we’ve provided allows you the room to move forward leveraging your own strengths. </p>

<p>A: Instructional assistants are powerful resources who can work in concert with licensed instructors in making contact with students and families and help implement the guidance and instructional supports. Many are treasured staff members to the students and can help in providing the necessary care and connection. They can also assist in logging the connections as a reference tool to track the touch points to ensure all students are contacted. </p>

<p>A: If you already operate an online program, offering credit recovery for seniors in particular is an allowable and much needed path to take.

Federal Programs
</h4>
<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="federalcc" id="federalcc"><strong>Are we still monitoring Federal Programs? </strong>(March 20) </a><br>A: The Oregon Department of Education would like to thank districts for their diligent and committed work during this time. The Department believes that districts and schools should be focused on responding to the needs of their students, families, and communities at this time, rather than preparing for and participating in monitoring visits. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Accordingly, given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Governor’s Executive Order 20-08, the Department has cancelled all on-site and desk monitoring scheduled for all federal programs, including for all programs under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This effort is an attempt to alleviate any unnecessary hardship to school districts and the families they serve and allow you to focus your efforts on supporting your students, families, and communities.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Federal Grants include: IDEA Part B, Title Grants under ESSA including: I-A, I-C, I-D, II-A, III, IV-A, IV-B, REAP, RLIS McKinney-Vento, Private Schools, and Foster Care components; and Perkins. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>This cancellation will continue through the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. In addition, all trainings, conferences, and on-site technical assistance are cancelled effective immediately. </p>

If an activity is different than what is stated within the approved CIP budget narratives, then an amendment must be submitted. If the LEA needs more or less funds for an activity already approved within a grant, an overage of up to 10% for any allowable grant activity is automatically approved and no amendment is needed. All activities must be reasonable, allocable, and necessary. A district can elect to revise an approved current year budget narrative to allow for expenditures to support students in the district following the Governor’s Executive Order 20-08 or utilize the carry-over process for federal funds. All expenditures are required to follow allowable expenditures guidelines.</p>

That means that any funds allocated for Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2019-2020 that are not used by September 30, 2020 will be available to the district through the carry-over application and expenditure process. The Department will allow districts to carry-over all funds that are remaining from the school year 2019-20 allocation due to COVID-19.

If the LEA treats its non-federally funded employees the same as its federally funded employees (2 CFR 200.431(a)), then federally funded staff can continue to be paid as normal despite school closures and work duties not able to be completed. This does not require any amendments to your grants. This includes certified and non-certified staff at both public and non-public schools. </p>

What is ODE’s recommendation for utilizing Title II-A funds when in-person professional learning cannot be the focus? </strong>(March 20) </a><br>A: Many districts engage in job-embedded professional learning such as coaching, mentoring, and professional learning communities that require regular contact. ODE encourages districts to consider how virtual tools might be used, where possible and appropriate, to maintain these collaborative learning opportunities. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>While travel to external professional learning is restricted, districts might consider shifting the focus to internally supported professional learning and systemic planning. For example, Title II-A allows districts to use funds to support flexible time for collaborative planning and curriculum writing as well as to develop, implement, and improve rigorous, transparent, and fair evaluation and support systems. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Title II-A also allows for the purchase of technology for professional learning purposes, so districts could choose to use some of their II-A funds to ensure that staff are connected to opportunities for professional learning during the school closure.

Creative models are being developed across the state to support our students and families during school closures. A program in partnership with school districts can elect to offer services and utilize staff in these efforts aligned with the Governor’s Executive Order 20-08. Assisting with food distribution and/ or providing enrichment opportunities, when schools are closed due to the Executive Order, are allowable activities. </p>

<p>All activities provided by 21st CCLC staff must align to program goals and the intent of grant. Comprehensive 21st CCLC services may not be possible due to reduced staff availability and students who choose not to participate. </p>

<ul>

<p>A: If a district is considering this option, they should consult ODE to consider a wide variety of factors including: Instructional time, compliance with FAPE, Division 22 standards, OHA guidance, and Executive Order 20-08. </p>

<p>A: The Governor’s Executive Order 20-08 states, “Continue to regularly pay all employees of public schools. A public school subject to this Executive Order may require school employees to report to work to assist with the provision of supplemental services and emergency management activities.” The Governor’s exercise of her powers under the state of emergency statutes may impact how existing collective bargaining agreements are administered. School districts may have to delay bargaining on modifications to their agreements given the need to immediately implement the directives of the Governor's Executive Order. School district officials should work with their general counsel and Human Resources staff to evaluate timing considerations for bargaining where traditional bargaining models are infeasible and emergency exceptions to bargaining may apply. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>The determination of which staff may be needed to work from home or onsite, with appropriate measures in place, sits with the school district leadership. They are receiving direction and requests from the state leadership and local sources. The districts need the support of state and local association leadership to fulfill the responsibilities of the Governor’s Executive Order so that they can maintain the flow of state school funding and continue to regularly pay all school district staff. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>At this time we have asked school districts to focus on: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Delivery of “Distance Learning for All” </li>
 <li>Provision of school meals. </li>
 <li>Provision of supplemental services and emergency management services, including but not limited to, the provision of child care for first responders, emergency workers, health care professionals, and other individuals, consistent with any guidance and requirements provided by the Oregon Department of Education. </li>
 <li>Continue to regularly pay all employees. </li>
</ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Schools must adjust to providing the requirements of <a href="/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-08.pdf">Executive Order 20-08</a> (out-of-school “Distance Learning for All”, school meals, and emergency child care) by: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Facilitating telework and work-at-home by employees, to the maximum extent possible. Work in buildings is prohibited whenever telework and work-at-home options are available, in light of position duties, availability of teleworking equipment, and network adequacy. This is clearly not possible for meal preparation and delivery or for the provision of child care. However, in some districts this will be possible for delivery of “Distance Learning for All” and related professional development to support teachers in this new way of delivering education. </li>
 <li>When telework and work-at-home options are not available, school districts, ESDs, and charter schools must designate an employee or officer to establish, implement, and enforce social distancing policies, consistent with guidance from the Oregon Health Authority. Such policies and activities must also address how the school will maintain social distancing protocols to the greatest extent possible for essential visitors and delivery of services. </li>
 <li>Employees in at-risk categories or who have an at-risk member of their household should not be required to physically report to a worksite. They may be assigned duties through telework or work-at-home. </li>

If the board is voting on any issue, OSBA recommends the Chair use roll call type of voting process to ensure each member’s vote is accurately captured.

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: We know that many high school students have to work right now and into the summer. It will be essential for districts to harness all creative solutions and options to meet students needing to navigate completing school, family safety, and getting basic needs met. Ideas include work-study credit, developing audio recordings or podcasts that could be engaged with while working (if safe to do so), or encouraging and supporting taking the GED for credit. Oregon regulations allow for multiple Credit Options at OAR 581-022-2025, as well, and ODE is making performance assessment materials available for educators to pursue these flexible credit-bearing options on ODE’s Credit Options webpage. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: This crisis illuminates a deeper need to bolster translation services, speed, and quality. Translation services are held and contracted in different ways by ODE and different school districts. In some communities, partnerships with CBOs for translation supports can and should be pursued. Where there are strong and existing contracts with translation service providers, it is a new opportunity for the state and districts to solve how to move more quickly and effectively to provide translations of essential documents. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A:  First and foremost, the focus is student safety and access to food.  Once that is established, districts are encouraged to contact and get expertise from their McKinney-Vento Act liaison. The following resources can also be helpful: </p>
<ul>
<li>Oregon’s regional Continuums of Care are networks of state and local programs assisting community members with housing and other services. </li>
<li>211-Info connects people with social and health services, shelter and transitional housing, food banks and homelessness assistance. </li>
<li>Community Action programs in many areas are providing assistance to families and individuals navigating poverty. </li>
<li>The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness has posted recommendations for planning, preparation and mitigation of coronavirus spread. </li>
<li>School House Connection’s website provides excellent resources for schools and early learning programs to address homelessness during this time. </li>
</ul>
<p>
With regard to instruction and engagement, it will require a collective community and district effort to pursue any and all options to meet students needing to navigate completing school, safety, and getting basic needs met. Ideas include work-study credit, developing audio recordings or podcasts that could be engaged with while working (if safe to do so), or encouraging and supporting taking the GED for credit. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Districts will be  focusing support and effort to ensure students have the greatest access to learning that will allow them to gain credits required for graduation. In this case, the student would need to make up the 10th grade English course. Given the  failing grade and the English credit is required for graduation, the student would need to enroll in credit-recovery or consider an alternate pathway (i.e., flexible Credit Options, additional schooling for the 2020-2021 school year, high school equivalency programs like the GED, etc.). </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Student GPAs will be generated based on the “freezing” of grades as of March 13, following the guidance outlined. The Office of Student Access and Completion (OSAC) is allowing students who would have otherwise raised their cumulative, unweighted GPA to 2.50 or higher to be considered for Oregon Promise as a result of school district actions relative to local or state emergency orders. </p>
<p>
High school registrars will use the GPA verification system and include the students where it would have been mathematically possible to raise their GPA to the 2.50 limit as MET. The deadline to submit GPA verifications is Friday, July 10. </p>
<p>
If a high school does not participate in GPA verification, the high school will need to include a cover letter when providing students with their final high school transcript to submit to OSAC. The cover letter must indicate that it would have been mathematically possible for the student to raise their GPA to the 2.50 limit if they earned letter grades for their final high school term. </p>
<p>
Additionally, encourage all seniors to complete the 2020-21 FAFSA or ORSAA as soon as possible (deadline is June 1 for high school seniors) so they are considered for federal, state and institutional financial aid. The Oregon Promise application deadline is June 1, 2020 for students graduating between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Districts may need to make plans for staff to verify student GPA during summer 2020. School staff can reach out to the staff at OSAC with any questions or for assistance. </p>

<p>
A: Potentially, yes. And, this will likely be true for student transcripts across the nation as nearly every senior is affected by COVID-19 school closuresTranscripts can reflect Pass/Incomplete indicators without having negative impact for students’ future pathway. Districts should consider how they present student transcripts, including the possibility of attaching a letter that indicates the Pass/Incomplete status, as reflective of the COVID-19 school closure. This practice has also been used by districts in the case of closures for natural disasters, such as the New Orleans Hurricane Katrina</p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Yes, students under this guidance in a trimester system are awarded credits based on prior coursework. However, the grade that is utilized should come from the preceding trimester which would be the 2nd trimester, not the first. In some cases, where coursework is offered in the first and third trimester (skipping the 2nd) then yes, you would use the first trimester grade. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: The senior would not likely pass the course and credit would not be awarded. If the course and/or credit was required for graduation, the student may need to enroll in credit-recovery or consider an alternate pathway (i.e., additional schooling for the 2020-2021 school year, high school equivalency programs like the GED, etc.).  However, in some cases districts may determine that credit should be awarded if there is a larger achievement pattern that deserves consideration. Upon review of the totality of the student’s educational experience, if it is determined that credit is justified, the decision should be supported with documentation. </p>

 </div>
<p>
A: Yes. Here’s a quick distillation of what’s in the full guidance on this subject: </p>
<ul>
<li>All of our seniors, regardless of credit status, deserve our personal attention, encouragement, and consistent emotional support.</li>
<li>Reach out to students and their families, by April 30, 2020, to affirm Oregon Diploma 2020 credit requirements have been met. Outline a plan to continue senior’s learning and transition to career and college. For seniors on an IEP who are graduating with a regular diploma, this must include notice of termination of IEP services upon commensurate with graduation date or the transition services offered during the closure. Seniors participating in Dual Credit, AP, IB, and other accelerated learning courses should continue and complete these courses to earn the college credit associated with the courses. </li>

<div>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: One of the strengths of this question is its attention to learning beyond a grade or a credit. To honor this question, we are giving you our best response, even if not fully satisfying. Learning is our natural state and students at all developmental ages are learners. Grades and credits are proxies for learning. Students enter college coursework in transitions that don’t match their prior knowledge or methods of learning a subject with how the college offers the same or similar content. The transitions required now for the Class of 2020 asks something of all educators, those sending and those receiving, and of the students to focus on what learning they need to make the critical connections and find their way forward.  We also ask community colleges and universities to be creative and caring in addressing the unintended learning gaps that this global crisis is causing. </p>

 </div>
<p>
A: The Office of Student Access and Completion (OSAC) is allowing students who would have otherwise raised their cumulative, unweighted GPA to 2.50 or higher to be considered for Oregon Promise as a result of school district actions relative to local or state emergency orders. The GPA requirement is still a cumulative, unweighted, 2.50 GPA. However, there will be flexibility provided for students who would have mathematically had the opportunity to raise their GPA to the 2.50 limit if letter grades were assigned for their final high school term. </p>
<p>
Please encourage all interested students to apply for Oregon Promise by the appropriate deadline, and submit the 2020-21 FAFSA or ORSAA. </p>
<p>
High school registrars will use the GPA verification system and include the students where it would have been mathematically possible to raise their GPA to the 2.50 limit as MET. The deadline to submit GPA verifications is Friday, July 10. Please visit OregonPromise.org for more information, or contact OregonPromise@hecc.oregon.gov with questions. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p> 
A: We are not in a position to predict how each institution of higher education will respond or what action they may take. However, we are in conversations with many public universities who are pledging care and support to the Class of 2020. We do anticipate there will be flexibility for seniors from higher education. Additionally, colleges and universities across the country are temporarily updating their admissions requirements to accept  (without disadvantaging students) Pass/No Pass grades in lieu of letter grades for all courses completed while schools are closed. This ensures the health and safety of our communities remains a priority during the COVID-19 response without penalizing students. Institutions of higher education (e.g., Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission, California university and college system, Stanford University, and Harvard University) continue to issue statements outlining these revised admissions policies. The Oregon public universities have committed to ensuring that applicants and prospective students are considered fairly in light of the educational interruption they have endured. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>A: In an emergency situation, where all children are to be served through distance learning for a period of time, serving children with disabilities with distance learning for that same period of time is not a substantial change in placement or material change in services and does not require consent, a prior written notice, amendment, or placement change. The district is simply responding to the Governor’s Executive Order to close school buildings and move to distance learning for an extended period of time. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>This was not a district or IEP Team decision. This is similar to a contingency plan being created for a student during the time a student is in a juvenile detention center or psychiatric residential treatment facility. The district did not act to place a student in that environment. The district is simply recording within the contingency learning plan the way in which it will provide special education services to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances until the student returns to their typical educational environment. Because the decision to close school buildings was not the district’s decision, any distance learning plan developed for a student does not constitute a material change in services or a substantial change in placement.

<div>
 </div>
<p>A: The Oregon public universities are committed to ensuring that new students who intend to enroll at our institutions are considered fairly in light of the educational interruption they have endured. No student admitted to our institutions for fall 2020 will have their admission rescinded due to changes in grading policy or the inability to complete their coursework, so long as they still graduate. Students who apply to our institutions are still subject to a review process that focuses on one's ability to succeed in college, but now recognizes that some situations are beyond their control. We look forward to supporting students and high schools through this challenging time, both now and with future graduating classes impacted by the pandemic.</p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>A: Building wi-fi access points are typically attached to the building and not mobile devices. However, if a library has mobile hotspot available, it may be possible to remain CIPA compliant through the use of a hot-spot device. ODE would advise that if a district wishes to pursue this, to consult with an ESD/District Network Administrator or Engineer to see if the hot-spot can run its traffic through a single tunnel to the SD/ESD external IP address into the SD/ESD Gateway. If this is possible, then traffic may be routed through the district/ESD filtering systems that meet CIPA compliance. Again, this is best advised by an ESD/District Network Administrator or Engineer. </p>

<p>A: The Governor’s Executive Order 20-08 states, “Continue to regularly pay all employees of public schools. A public school subject to this Executive Order may require school employees to report to work to assist with the provision of supplemental services and emergency management activities.” The Governor’s exercise of her powers under the state of emergency statutes may impact how existing collective bargaining agreements are administered. School districts may have to delay bargaining on modifications to their agreements given the need to immediately implement the directives of the Governor's Executive Order. School district officials should work with their general counsel and Human Resources staff to evaluate timing considerations for bargaining where traditional bargaining models are infeasible and emergency exceptions to bargaining may apply. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>The determination of which staff may be needed to work from home or onsite, with appropriate measures in place, sits with the school district leadership. They are receiving direction and requests from the state leadership and local sources. The districts need the support of state and local association leadership to fulfill the responsibilities of the Governor’s Executive Order so that they can maintain the flow of state school funding and continue to regularly pay all school district staff. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>At this time we have asked school districts to focus on: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Delivery of “Distance Learning for All” </li>
 <li>Provision of school meals. </li>
 <li>Provision of supplemental services and emergency management services, including but not limited to, the provision of child care for first responders, emergency workers, health care professionals, and other individuals, consistent with any guidance and requirements provided by the Oregon Department of Education. </li>
 <li>Continue to regularly pay all employees. </li>
</ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Schools must adjust to providing the requirements of <a href="/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-08.pdf">Executive Order 20-08</a> (out-of-school “Distance Learning for All”, school meals, and emergency child care) by: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Facilitating telework and work-at-home by employees, to the maximum extent possible. Work in buildings is prohibited whenever telework and work-at-home options are available, in light of position duties, availability of teleworking equipment, and network adequacy. This is clearly not possible for meal preparation and delivery or for the provision of child care. However, in some districts this will be possible for delivery of “Distance Learning for All” and related professional development to support teachers in this new way of delivering education. </li>
 <li>When telework and work-at-home options are not available, school districts, ESDs, and charter schools must designate an employee or officer to establish, implement, and enforce social distancing policies, consistent with guidance from the Oregon Health Authority. Such policies and activities must also address how the school will maintain social distancing protocols to the greatest extent possible for essential visitors and delivery of services. </li>
 <li>Employees in at-risk categories or who have an at-risk member of their household should not be required to physically report to a worksite. They may be assigned duties through telework or work-at-home. </li>
</ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>In the same way that food supplies are an emerging issue, so too might be workforce capacity. In the meantime, if available, hiring substitutes remains a local decision and is a reasonable response.

<p>A: Distance learning does not mean online learning alone. While Distance Learning may include online options for some students, it does not require technology or the internet to result in successful learning. For many of our 197 districts in Oregon, distance learning may not include online experiences. Students engaging in distance learning have access to appropriate educational materials and receive ongoing interaction with their licensed and/or registered teacher(s). It is important to note that distance learning includes multimedia communication and blended learning strategies, not just digital/online learning. Learning may or may not be separated in time (asynchronous vs. synchronous). </p>

<p>ODE has sent a survey to every district. The hope that ODE can use this data in three ways to support your access to technology: </p>

<li>Work with philanthropy and business &amp; industry to identify and support needs </li>
 <li>Work with state procurement contracts to ease purchasing barriers and costs </li>
 <li>Identify any available state funds and federal stimulus funds to support district purchasing efforts. </li>

<p>A: In order to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect our students and educators, Governor Brown issued Executive Order 20-08 that closed schools through April 28. Our state’s response to COVID-19 has responsibly and necessarily evolved with the use of data and knowledge of effective suppression measures. As we continue the effective measures of Governor Brown’s “Stay Home, Save Lives” order, we also foresee the strong possibility that our students may not come back through our school house doors this academic year, but that decision remains in the jurisdiction of the Governor. Right now, we cannot predict what is allowable for end of year activities and recognize the impact it will have on time honored celebrations and transitions. </p>

If a home schooling option will be temporary (less than 18 months), the home school testing requirement will not apply. However, for students who need to maintain eligibility to participate in athletics, there may be additional requirements on behalf of the OSAA (<i>guidance on this forthcoming</i>).</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>For high school seniors, home schooling has slightly different implications. Most importantly, there is not a home school diploma. For students who have plans to attend a college or university, check with the institution’s registrar and verify admission requirements. One option for home schooled students is to <a href="/highered/institutions-programs/ccwd/pages/hs-equivalency.aspx">take the GED test</a> as four-year institutions accept GED scores for admission; local testing centers can offer details regarding availability.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>The following information is intended to help guide parents and guardians considering home schooling:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with your school district and let them know of your plans to home school temporarily</li>
 <li>Notify your local <a href="/ode/learning-options/HomeSchool/Pages/default.aspx">Education Service District (ESD)</a> of your intent to home school temporarily. Most ESDs have an electronic form on their Home School webpage. ORS 339.035(2)</li>
 <li>Consider connecting with other parents in your community who are home schooling or connect to a home school network such as <a href="http://www.ohen.org/frequently-asked-questions/">Oregon Home Education Network (OHEN)</a>
</li>
 <li>Review <a href="/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx">Oregon’s academic content standards</a> for the appropriate grade(s) to ensure your child(ren) stays on track to graduate</li>
 <li>Maintain communication with your child(ren)’s neighborhood school</li>

<div>
 </div>
<p>A: Schools have a great deal of freedom to respond in creative ways at this time. However, if you want federal reimbursement a voucher program like this isn’t currently reimbursable. ODE’s Child Nutrition Program will follow-up with USDA to get additional guidance on this or ways it might work at a very local level. </p>

 </div>
<p>Meanwhile, the Federal Pandemic EBT Program (P-EBT) has been applied for by DHS in conjunction with ODE Child Nutrition Programs. This will be a coordinated effort from ODE to collect student information from the Enrollment System and provide it to DHS to open benefit accounts. The benefits are worth $5.78 per child per day. For schools in the Federal Nutrition Program, students eligible for free/reduced meals, and all students in non-pricing schools will be receiving funds at their home address. This is an opt-in program, benefit cards need to be activated before use. </p>

<strong>SSO and SFSP sponsors can serve and claim breakfast and lunch if/when offered at the same time</strong> <br>This was originally approved for SFSP sponsors only. USDA provided approval for SSO sponsors as well.</li>
 <li>
<strong>School Food Authority sponsors of SFSP and SSO sites can claim meals directly served to children’s homes</strong> <ul>
<li>Schools that have been approved for non-congregate feeding through SFSP or SSO may be reimbursed for meals delivered directly to children’s homes.</li>
 <li>Schools electing to deliver meals may serve only children who are in area eligible locations or who are eligible for free or reduced price meals.</li>
 <li>Schools operating a closed-enrolled site may enroll children who are certified as eligible for free or reduced price meals, and deliver meals only to the enrolled, eligible children.</li>
 <li>Delivery may include more than one meal, e.g. a breakfast and a lunch, per delivery location as ODE CNP previously received USDA approval to waive mealtime restrictions in SFSP and SSO.</li>
 <li>Delivery may include meals for multiple days, up to one week at a time. </li>
 <li>When meals are delivered, children do NOT need to be present at the time of delivery as long as the school has obtained written consent from households that they want to receive delivered meals.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
 <li>
<strong>Meals can be offered and claimed through the SFSP/SSO or the National School Lunch Program (NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP) if school facilities are closed but schools continue to operate.</strong> <ul>
<li>SFSP/SSO option - If school buildings are closed unexpectedly during the school year due to COVID-19, USDA considers this an unanticipated school closure. Even if the district is operating or providing online school, if the building is closed and students cannot attend their physical school location for classes, SFAs and community organizations (COs) may operate SFSP and SSO programs as permitted under program requirements.</li>
 <li>NSLP/SBP option - If an SFA considers a school to be operating and wishes to continue offering NSLP and SBP during such building closures, non-congregate meals can be offered. Schools would continue to claim and be reimbursed for meals based on the eligibility status of the individual student. All other NSLP and SBP requirements would apply.</li>

Governor Brown called for districts to meet this challenge and has charged ODE to help. We have created <a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-Food-Resources.aspx">a page with links to district websites</a> outlining their plans for feeding children during school closure.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>There are options available to continue meal service at school and non-school sites through the Summer Food Service Program or Summer Seamless Option. The Oregon Department of Education Child Nutrition Programs (ODE CNP) encourages sponsors participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and/or the School Breakfast Program (SBP), Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to use Program flexibilities to help ensure that there is no lapse in food security during a closure.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>ODE has received approval from USDA on the following waivers:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<ol>
<li>To operate the SFSP or SSO at school sites (meaning any place meals are delivered) during unanticipated school closures. This opens up more sites for sponsors to offer meals for reimbursement. This waiver is in effect through June 30, 2020 or upon expiration of the federally-declared public health emergency, whichever is earlier.</li>
 <li>To allow for non-congregate meals to be served during unanticipated school closures through SFSP and SSO. This means sponsors can serve meals through Grab and Go like services and be reimbursed for the meals. These meals must be distributed directly to children. This prohibits meal service that would gather people into a room. This waiver is in effect through June 30, 2020 or upon expiration of the federally-declared public health emergency, whichever is earlier</li>
 <li>To serve meals without mealtime restrictions during the unanticipated school closures. This means that meals provided through SFSP may include a breakfast and a lunch, or a lunch and a snack served at the same meal service and claim both for reimbursement. This waiver is approved by FNS through April 30, 2020.</li>
 <li>To waive the first week site visit for returning SFSP sites that have operated successfully in the previous year. This will reduce the burden of conducting a first week visit at returning SFSP sites. This waiver is approved by FNS through April 30, 2020.</li>
</ol>
<div>
 </div>
<p>ODE is seeking waivers and/or verification from the federal government to do the following:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Provide reimbursement for meals served to sites that are not area eligible</li>
 <li>Provide reimbursement for meals that are delivered directly to homes</li>
 <li>Provide reimbursement for meals that are provided when a child is not present</li>
 </ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Please review the <a href="/ode/students-and-family/childnutrition/MemoDocuments/Meal%20Service%20During%20Unanticipated%20School%20Closures.pdf">December 24, 2019 ODE CNP memo on Meal Service During Unanticipated School Closures</a> for additional information.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Generally speaking, districts should follow their SFSP and SSO processes in accordance with the memo linked above.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Continue to watch for updates to this response, ODE is actively and regularly seeking waivers as well as state resources to ease district efforts to feed our children.</p>

While the Governor’s order did not include direction to private schools, many private schools across the state had already closed and/or transitioned to distance learning based on the same public health imperative and guidance from the CDC. These actions taken together should serve as strong encouragement for all private education providers to consider similar action. Private schools and education providers seeking further guidance for appropriate social distancing protocols or facility closure decisions, should consult their county public health officer.</p>

<p>A: Yes.  While closed under <a href="/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-08.pdf">E.O. 20-08</a>, school districts must enroll resident students who request enrollment. School districts may choose to enroll non-resident students under current laws such as interdistrict transfers.

<p>A: Yes.  Public charter schools may choose to enroll students based on their school policies, charter agreements and state law. Public charter schools must provide educational services to all enrolled students pursuant to <a href="/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-08.pdf">E.O. 20-08</a> and the <a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Documents/Distance%20Learning%20for%20All%20Guidance%20March%202020.pdf">Distance Learning for All</a> guidance.

</div>

<p> A: Possibly. If a public charter school has a policy which restricts enrollment beyond its cap such as to a particular date range or a lower cap then the public charter school may deny enrollment based on its policy. If a public charter school has no policy further restricting enrollment and wishes to restrict enrollment then the school may either work with its sponsor to amend its charter to restrict enrollment or adopt a policy to restrict enrollment. Regardless of its policies or charter agreement, a public charter school may not discriminate in enrollment pursuant to ORS 338.125(2)(c).</p>

</strong> (April 15)</a><br>
</div>
<p>A: Yes. School districts have the option to deny a student’s enrollment in a virtual charter school if more than 3% of the district’s student population is currently enrolled in virtual charter schools located in other districts. Districts should maintain careful record keeping and provide clear communication with families enrolling in virtual charter schools. When a parent gives the school district notice of intent to enroll a student in a virtual charter school and receives a notice of denial, a parent may appeal the decision of a school district to deny a student’s enrollment at a virtual charter school to the Oregon Department of Education (ODE).

</div>
<p>A: Yes. Although a school may only drop a student from the active enrollment list if the school has received notice from a parent of the withdrawal or the public school has knowledge (e.g. records request or other formal acknowledgement from the other district/school) that the student is receiving services from another school. Students may also be withdrawn if the student is registered with an education service district as a homeschooled student or to enroll in a private school. </p>

<p> A: No. Enrollment or withdrawal of a student will not impact a school district’s or public charter school’s ADMw during the time of school closure. State School Fund allocations for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year will be based on the school district’s and charter school’s ADM in the 2nd period ADM data collection as of December 31, 2019.

</div>
<p> A: During the time school facilities are closed and students are not under the guidance and direction of teachers, per the definition of Day in session per OAR 581-023-0006(f), these days would not be considered a session day. However, schools and districts will still need to track contact with students enrolled at their school(s), to the extent practical, in an attempt to provide distance learning while schools are closed. Per the Executive Order 20-08, schools shall continue to receive allocations from the State School Fund for the period of closure when they meet the five provisions on page 3, Section 4, parts a-e. While there is no expectation that schools track attendance through previously used mechanisms, schools should create a system that logs student contact so they can estimate the number of students engaged during this time, and most importantly, understand which students they are not able to reach through <a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Documents/Distance%20Learning%20for%20All%20Guidance%20March%202020.pdf">Distance Learning for All</a>.

</div>
<p>A: Assuming the relative is not a legal guardian or a person in parental relationship to the student, the school district that most recently enrolled the student is still responsible for general education services. You can help by alerting the school district of the student’s new location.  If the relative is a legal guardian or a person in parental relationship to the student as defined in ORS 339.133 then you must enroll the student as a resident student upon request and begin serving the student. </p>

</div>
<p>A: Annual Cumulative ADM is the primary source for graduation, completion, and dropout events for our students. School districts must report all graduation and completion events that occurred during the 2019-20 school year and, to the best of their ability, the other outcome events for students enrolled through March 13th, 2020. For the next State School Fund reconciliation in May 2021 ODE will not use the 2019-20 Annual ADM data collection; however, there are still a lot of data in the collection used for other purposes. Therefore, it is very important to complete the Annual ADM collection using the March 13, 2020 cutoff date for these other needs.

</div>
<p>A: Days present and days absent are only reported while school is in session. This means that no days present or days absent will be reported in Cumulative ADM during the period of school closure, including the period during which districts are implementing <a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Documents/Distance%20Learning%20for%20All%20Guidance%20March%202020.pdf">Distance Learning for All</a>.

<p>While no attendance data will be reported for the period when schools are closed, schools and districts will still need to track with students enrolled at their school(s), to the extent practical, in an attempt to provide distance learning while schools are closed, starting April 13th.

</div>
<p>A: For students in a non-standard program (ADMProgram types ‘04’ to ’10’) report the hours of instruction received from the start of the school year through March 13.  Do not include any instructional hours for the period that schools are closed by the Governor, including the period where districts are implementing <a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Documents/Distance%20Learning%20for%20All%20Guidance%20March%202020.pdf">Distance Learning for All</a>.     </p>

<p>However, schools and districts must still track the time spent interacting with every student enrolled at their school(s), to the extent practical, in an attempt to provide distance learning while schools are closed, starting April 13th.  Additional guidance on this is forthcoming.

</strong> (April 15)</a><br>
</div>
<p> A: A school district will receive funding for the second-half of the school year at the same rate it received funding through the 2nd period for students being reported with hours of instruction. The ADM formula for part-time students using hours of instruction takes into account only half of the year, or the state average of 73 days. E.g., Large Group Instruction shall be computed by multiplying total hours of instruction given all students during the reporting period by a factor of .167 and dividing the product by 73 for the July 1 to December 31 period cumulative report.

</div>
<p> A: For those students eligible for Expanded Options, Post Graduate Scholars and College Coursework (other) you should report the college credits earned during the Spring Term, as applicable. Please only submit records for those students enrolled on March 13.  </p>

</div>
<p>A: ADM End Date codes should reflect the status of the student at the time the district ceases to provide Distance Learning for All during the 2019-2020 school year.  For example, students who were served for the duration of the Distance Learning for All timeframe and are expected to return to the school in the following school year should be coded as ‘1A’. As another example, students who earn a diploma or other credential on or before June 30, 2020 should have this outcome reported in their End Date Code. This will allow ODE to correctly calculate graduation rates. </p>

<p>Remember that diplomas awarded between July 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 will be included in 2019-20 cohort graduation rate calculations. They should be reported in First Period 2020-21 with a Program Type 14 record. If a student receives the credential after the end of the district’s period of Distance Learning for All (say June 10) but before June 30, submit a program type 14 record for the student’s outcome in the Annual 2019-20 collection.</p>

<p>We realize that districts may have incomplete information for some students at the time Annual ADM is submitted. Districts should anticipate using the Exit Adjustment window in Fall 2020 to update Annual ADM records, as more information becomes available for their students.</p>

<p> A:  Students are still receiving services through Distance Learning for All, even though these days do not count as session days. In order to better understand enrollment, and to receive accurate dates of graduation and other outcome events, the ADMEndDt should reflect either the outcome date for the student or the last day that Distance Learning for All is conducted by the district. (Remembering that the submitted ADMEndDt is the first weekday after the actual event.) </p>

<p>Remember that no session days will be reported while the Distance Learning for All is in operation.</p>

</strong> (April 15)</a><br>
</div>
<p> A:  In general, you would not report in Cumulative ADM any enrollment for students who were first enrolled after March 13th.  However, important exceptions exist. </p>

<p>If a student enrolls in your district after March 13th and has any one of the following outcomes, please submit an ADM program type 14 record for this student: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled in another district (2A) </li>
<li>Enrolled in non-public school or setting, including homeschool (2B) </li>
<li>Enrolled in another state or country (2C) </li>
<li>Enrolled in a Public Agency (2D) </li>
<li>Awarded a High School Diploma (4A) </li>
<li>Received a certificate of completion (4C) </li>
<li>Received a GED (4E) </li>
<li>Met requirements for a high school diploma, but not yet awarded (4F) </li>
<li>Met requirements for a high school diploma, but continuing as a Post Graduate Scholar (4G) </li>
<li>Enrolled in a Foreign Exchange Program (5C) </li>
<li>Died or permanently incapacitated (6A) </li>
<li>Returned after receiving a credential and exited again (6B) </li>
</ul>
<p>This information is extremely important and will help ODE calculate accurate graduation rates for 2019-20.  These records can be submitted with Annual ADM, or through the Exit Adjustment window in Fall 2020.</p>

</strong> (April 15)</a><br>
</div>
<p> A: It is important for ODE to have information on these events, since we cannot calculate accurate graduation, completion, or dropout rates without it.  In these cases, districts will need to submit an ADM record with program type code ‘14’ and the appropriate ADM End Date Code. See the previous question for more details.

</div>
<p>A: No. Essential Skills have been suspended for this year’s seniors, defined as students who first enrolled in ninth grade in the 2016-2017 school year or earlier (including 5th or 6th year seniors), and for students who first enrolled in ninth grade in the 2017-2018 school year or later that have an early graduation plan for 2019-2020 that was approved before the Executive Order (EO 20-08) was issued on March 17, 2020.  </p>

<p>Due to this suspension, the Essential Skill fields will allow “0 – Not Applicable” to be used for graduation records. If a student has completed their essential skills you can still provide that information in their graduation record, but you will not receive an error for using “0 – Not Applicable” when completing the records</p>

<p>If you choose to enter an essential skills code, you must submit the corresponding essential skills date.

</div>
<p>A:  Report ADMFTE based on the FTE of the student’s enrollment through March 13th. Students who were scheduled (while schools were open) in more than one-half of the full-day program are given an FTE of 1.0. Students who were scheduled for one-half or less of the full-day program are given an FTE of 0.5. We realize that this may require adjustments to programming at the local level. </p>

</div>

<p>A: The short answer is possibly. A parent may request this from their local school district but ultimately grade placement is a school district decision. ODE encourages families to put what’s unfolding now into context in making this decision. As districts offer “Distance Learning for All” and as students move through learning together with peers, we would generally see more value for students and for the school and school system to move together (even into a new grade) through these times. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>A: There is no expectation that schools track attendance through previously used mechanisms. Schools should create a system that logs student contact so they can estimate the number of students engaged during this time, and most importantly, understand which students they are not able to reach through “Distance Learning for All”. It is important for schools to know which students they need to seek alternative methods to communicate with. This is the key priority for attendance. Accountability related to attendance has been waived for the 2019-20 school year. </p>

Governor Brown has assembled an economic taskforce to assess and advice on economic implications from taking public health action. One of the biggest variables is an unknown time horizon. ODE’s current approach is to be clear-eyed and walk two paths at the same time, keeping work moving that keeps open the possibility for these programs and aims for them to still come to fruition while also navigating the real financial uncertainties and making prudent assessments. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>Districts receiving allocations from the SSF during the closure period must: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Deliver <a href="/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/Distance-Learning-for-All.aspx">Distance Learning for All</a>. </li>
 <li>Provide school meals in non-congregate settings through the Summer Food Service Program and Seamless Summer Option, consistent with requirements provided by the Oregon Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </li>
 <p>Pupil Transportation services and equipment may be used by public schools for delivery of meals in non-congregate settings to eligible school sites. These transportation costs are eligible for partial reimbursement per the Administrative Rules for the State School Fund Transportation Grant found in OAR 581-023-0040. The Governor’s Executive Order 20-08 permits these expenses as allowable costs eligible for reimbursement during this emergency, or until further notice. </p>
 <p>Accounting for these transportation expenses should follow the normal protocol found in the chart of accounts in the Program Budget and Accounting Manual. There is interest to monitor this impact, so please keep track of mileage for these trips associated with providing meals. </p>
 <li>Provide for supplemental services and emergency management services, including but not limited to, the provision of child care for first responders, emergency workers, health care professionals, and other individuals, consistent with any guidance and requirements provided by the Oregon Department of Education. Public schools may use transportation grant funds from the State School Fund for school district transportation services to support the transportation of children to and from school-based child care. </li>
 <li>Develop plans for the operation of essential, non-educational services, including food services, to students and families. </li>
 <li>Continue to regularly pay all employees of public schools. A public school subject to this Executive Order may require school employees to report to work to assist with the provision of supplemental services and emergency management activities. </li>

<p>A: Extended ADMw would help districts experiencing reduced average daily membership due to students being out for extended periods of time. Even if a district’s ADMw changes during the 2019-20 school year due to COVID – 19 absences, their ADMw could never dip below the extended ADMw. </p>

<p>District extended ADMw (extADMw) is current ADMw or ADMw of the prior year, whichever is greater. The 2019-20 SY is comparing 2018-19 against 2019-20 ADMw and using the higher of the two for the state school fund payment calculation. </p>

A public school subject to this Executive Order may require school employees to report to work to assist with the provision of supplemental services and emergency management activities.”</p>
<div>

<p>The Governor’s exercise of her powers under the state of emergency statutes may impact how existing collective bargaining agreements are administered.

<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="staffe" id="staffe"><strong>Governor Brown directed school districts on March 12, 2020 to have staff come back to school on March 30 and 31 to prepare for students returning to school. With the issuance of Executive Order 20-08 , must school districts still bring back staff physically to school on March 30 and 31? </strong>(April 6)</a><br> A:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p><i>Initial Closure<br></i>On March 12, Governor Brown initially announced a school closure of two weeks for staff and two weeks and two days for students. This initial closure was in consideration of staffing challenges and health concerns due to the public health threat of coronavirus. This closure was replaced and superseded by <a href="https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-extends-statewide-school-closure-until-april-28-publishes-full-executive-orders" style="font-size:8pt">Executive Order 20-08</a>. The initial announcement should no longer serve as guidance; districts are no longer required to bring all staff physically onsite on March 30 and 31.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p><i>Current Closure</i> <br><span style="font-size:8pt">On March 17, all public schools, including those operated by school districts, education service districts (ESDs), and public charter schools were closed through April 28 under Governor Brown’s <a href="https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-extends-statewide-school-closure-until-april-28-publishes-full-executive-orders" style="font-size:8pt">Executive Order 20-08</a>. This order is consistent with the mitigation strategies recommended by the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) with regard to COVID-19, in order to slow the spread of the disease and to protect Oregonians at the highest risk of contracting the disease.</span></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Under this order schools will continue to receive allocations from the SSF during the closure period if they perform the following services:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Deliver <a href="/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/Distance-Learning-for-All.aspx">"Distance Learning for All"</a> to students to the extent practical through independent study and other appropriate options.</li>
 <li>Provide school meals, consistent with requirements provided by the Oregon Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Transportation grant funds from the SSF may be used by public schools for delivery of meals.</li>
 <li>Provide for supplemental services and emergency management services, including but not limited to the provision of child care for first responders, emergency workers, health care professionals, and other individuals, consistent with any guidance and requirements provided by the Early Learning Division. Public schools may use transportation grant funds from the SSF for school district transportation services to support the transportation of children to and from school-based child care.</li>
 <li>Develop plans for the operation of essential, non-educational services, including food services to students and families.</li>
 <li>Continue to regularly pay all employees of public schools. A public school subject to this Executive Order may require school employees to report to work to assist with the provision of supplemental services and emergency management activities. However, this should not be construed to require public school employees in at-risk categories, or public school employees who have an at-risk member of their household, to take action inconsistent with public health recommendations or the advice of the employee’s physician.</li>
</ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Simply put, schools are closed for normal operation and, instead, they must pay staff their regular wages to perform new tasks, under new circumstances, in service to their community in unprecedented times. During the closure, schools must provide Distance Learning for All, school meals and emergency child care. Staff must be available to fulfill these obligations to earn their regular wages.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p><i>Stay Home. Save Lives. <br></i>On March 23, Governor Brown issued <a href="/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a>, titled “Stay Home, Save Lives.” As part of an ongoing effort to mitigate the spread and impact of COVID-19, this order places restrictions on the activities of all Oregonians.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>This order does not change the requirements of Oregon’s school closure under <a href="https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-extends-statewide-school-closure-until-april-28-publishes-full-executive-orders">Executive Order 20-08</a>. However, it may change the way school districts, ESDs, and charter schools go about implementing the requirements under the school closure.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Schools must adjust to providing the requirements of <a href="https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-extends-statewide-school-closure-until-april-28-publishes-full-executive-orders%20(">Executive Order 20-08</a> <a href="/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/Distance-Learning-for-All.aspx">"Distance Learning for All,"</a> school meals, and emergency child care) by:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Facilitating telework and work-at-home by employees, to the maximum extent possible. Work in buildings is prohibited whenever telework and work-at-home options are available, in light of position duties, availability of teleworking equipment, and network adequacy. This is clearly not possible for meal preparation and delivery or for the provision of child care. However, in some districts this will be possible for delivery of Distance Learning for All and related professional development to support teachers in this new way of delivering education.</li>
 <li>When telework and work-at-home options are not available, school districts, ESDs, and charter schools must designate an employee or officer to establish, implement, and enforce social distancing policies, consistent with guidance from the Oregon Health Authority. Such policies and activities must also address how the school will maintain social distancing protocols to the greatest extent possible for essential visitors and delivery of services.</li>
 <li>Childcare must be carried out in maximum stable groups of 10 or fewer children (“stable” means the same 10 or fewer children are in the same group each day), and in a classroom that cannot be accessed by children outside the stable group.</li>
 <li>Schools must prioritize the childcare needs of first responders, emergency workers and health care professionals, followed by critical operations staff and essential personnel, consistent with guidance provided by the Oregon Department of Education, Early Learning Division.</li>
 <li>Employees in at-risk categories or who have an at-risk member of their household should not be required to physically report to a worksite. They may be assigned duties through telework or work-at-home.</li>
 </ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p><i>Key Points</i></p>
<div>
 </div>
<ol>
<li>The original school closure was superseded by <a href="https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-extends-statewide-school-closure-until-april-28-publishes-full-executive-orders">Executive Order 20-08</a>. There is no requirement for districts to assign all staff to physically return to work on March 30 and 31.</li>
 <li>
<a href="https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-extends-statewide-school-closure-until-april-28-publishes-full-executive-orders">Executive Order 20-08</a> closed schools through April 28. This closure date will be reviewed in April as more is known about the spread of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts.</li>
 <li>During the closure schools must pay staff to work differently to provide Distance Learning for All, school meals, and emergency child care.</li>
 <li>Schools must also adhere to provisions of <a href="/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a>, titled “Stay Home, Save Lives.” by facilitating telework and work-at-home whenever possible, enforcing social distancing measures when staff must be onsite, and ensuring employees who are at-risk or have household members at-risk are not required to physically report to a worksite.</li>

Her powers under a state of emergency are set out in ORS 443.441 and 401.165 through 401.236. During a state of emergency, the Governor has broad powers to control state agencies and state resources.

<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="staffb" id="staffb"><strong>What guidance or advice can ODE offer for districts navigating work requirements or expectations for staff? </strong>(April 6)</a> <br>A: Through <a href="https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-extends-statewide-school-closure-until-april-28-publishes-full-executive-orders">Executive Order 20-08</a>, Governor Kate Brown addressed a number of specific questions school leaders have been asking regarding the implications of school closure. Below we’ve attempted to answer what districts can do, noting that most of the questions in this domain are local decisions within the context of the Executive Order. Districts continue to be advised to work directly with their Human Resource Departments and use your existing Human Resources policies and collective bargaining contracts as guides when implementing the Governor’s Executive Order. As you navigate through the meeting the directives set out by the Governor, work with your local bargaining units to come to agreements that may adjust your existing contracts.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>While you navigate what steps to take in an ever-changing reality, please keep in mind the Governor’s directive on ensuring employee safety within Executive Order 20-08:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p><i>Nothing in this Executive Order should be construed to require public school employees in at-risk categories, or public school employees who have an at-risk member of their household, to take action inconsistent with public health recommendations or the advice of the employee’s physician.</i></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Given this encouragement and the Governor’s directives, ODE would <strong>expect</strong> districts would maintain or even re-deploy staffing to support: </p>
<div>
 </div>
<ul>
<li>Nutrition Services</li>
 <li>Transportation Services</li>
 <li>Maintenance, custodial, and building cleaning/sanitizing</li>
 <li>Payroll and other essential business functions</li>
 <li>Answering phones and keeping website information and communications updated, particularly in support of sharing information about meal access, childcare, and caring for first responders and health care providers</li>
 <li>Providing <a href="/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/Distance-Learning-for-All.aspx">"Distance Learning for All" </a>to students</li>
</ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>District employees might, where possible, complete some of the above activities while working remotely in accordance with district policies while complying with all other guidance and directives, including social distancing practices.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Like ODE, ESDs, and other public institutions, school districts have important local policy decisions to make regarding how to handle remote work options, staff requests to take leave or work from a distance based on exposure, concerns of exposure, childcare needs, or being in the identified population of those most vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Local districts will also need to work closely with their labor associations through their collective bargaining agreements to deploy needed services.</p>

<h4>Students Who Experience Disability </h4>

<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="studentsee" id="studentsee"><strong>I'm concerned about students on IEPs and students with disabilities, what are the additional support for these students and families? </strong> (April 16)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Students protected under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) require further consideration under the law. In determining status towards graduation using the Pass/Incomplete status, districts must consider the additional guidance below to ensure our commitment to equity and access for students with IEPs. </p>
<p>
Seniors with IEPs On Track to Graduate</p>
<ol>
<li>Communicate with the family regarding:
<ul>
<li>Oregon Diploma: Termination of Services</li>
<li>Modified or Extended Diploma: Transition Services offered during closure</li>
<li>Certificate of Completion: Transition Services offered during closure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the student earns an Oregon Diploma, the district’s FAPE obligation to that student will end. The student will no longer receive K-12 educational services, including those prescribed by the IEP. 
<ul><li>If the parent/guardian wants the student to continue to receive special education services through the originally planned graduation date, the IEP team will need to meet to discuss the continued need for special education services pending graduation. Teams can make a decision, with implications for graduation:
<ul>
<li>The student continues to require services and will not graduate at this time. The IEP team must develop a plan to provide credit earning options under Distance Learning for All that enables the student to graduate by August 31, 2020. FAPE must continue to be provided until graduation. </li>
<li>The student no longer requires services and can graduate. Parent retains rights under Procedural Safeguards. </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additional Considerations for Seniors with IEPs who may Need Credits to Graduate</p>
<ol><li>The district must ensure appropriate services and supports were provided before classifying the senior as not on track. At a minimum, this includes:
<ul>
<li>Reviewing IEP records to ensure that district provided FAPE; </li>
<li>Gathering evidence from each teacher/course that an appropriately developed IEP was fully implemented. Such documentation shall include, but is not limited to evidence that all:
<ul>
<li>Specially designed instruction (SDI) was delivered as intended by the IEP team, consistent with the initiation, frequency, and duration required;</li>
<li>Accommodations, related services and supplementary aids and services were delivered as intended by the IEP team; and</li>
<li>Evidence that the IEP team worked towards the measurable annual goals contained within the IEP, including progress monitoring data specific to those goals; and</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensuring that the parent, guardian, or person in a parental relationship was afforded the opportunity to meaningfully participate in the IEP process, including any meetings where student progress towards graduation was reviewed.</li>
</ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
<i>Documentation for requirements in 1a-1c above in which the senior was considered not on track must be provided. If such documentation cannot be provided, the district shall hold that student harmless during the closure.</i> </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A:For students who experience disability and have an IEP, there are several procedural safeguards in place that are protected under federal law. These remain in effect when a district implements “Distance Learning for All”.  The closure of schools and the shift to Distance Learning for All ensures that each district has an obligation to the provisions of FAPE for all students protected under IDEA. This will require strong partnership and flexibility as we all work together to meet the needs of our students during this emergency school closure. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A: Modified and Extended Diploma options remain available choices for school teams. The Graduation Pathways 2020 guidance includes specific requirements for IEP teams when a student finishes with a modified or extended diploma. Students who are working toward a modified and extended diplomas deserve personalized attention and prioritized support as they may be particularly vulnerable during this time of school closure. </p>

<a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="studentsaa" id="studentsaa"><strong>Regarding students who experience disability, does “Distance Learning for All” require a change of placement? Do we need to make that change on the IEPs? </strong> (April 6)</a> </div>
<p>A: In an emergency situation, where all children are to be served through distance learning for a period of time, serving children with disabilities with distance learning for that same period of time is not a substantial change in placement or material change in services and does not require consent, a prior written notice, amendment, or placement change. The district is simply responding to the Governor’s Executive Order to close school buildings and move to distance learning for an extended period of time. This was not a district or IEP Team decision. This is similar to a contingency plan being created for a student during the time a student is in a juvenile detention center or psychiatric residential treatment facility. The district did not act to place a student in that environment. The district is simply recording within the contingency learning plan the way in which it will provide special education services to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances until the student returns to their typical educational environment. Because the decision to close school buildings was not the district’s decision, any distance learning plan developed for a student does not constitute a material change in services or a substantial change in placement. Here are key guidance documents for Special Education Services and please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:candace.pelt@ode.state.or.us">reach out to Candace Pelt</a> as she is meeting regularly with the Special Education Directors. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="studentsy" id="studentsy"><strong>Is a district and/or school or ECSE program required to continue to provide FAPE to students who experience disabilities during a school closure caused by COVID-19? </strong>March 18 </a><br>A: It would be helpful to read the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-coronavirus-fact-sheet.pdf">guidance from the US Department of Education</a>. During closures for schools, districts, and programs due to the COVID-19, where there are no other educational programs or educational services offered to the general student population (or in the case of ECSE, to all students in the program), schools, districts, and programs are not required to provide services to students who experience disability during that period of time, unless such services are specifically required by the student’s IFSP or IEP (e.g., Extended School Year services).</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Once the school or ECSE program resumes, the district and/or school or ECSE program must make every effort to provide special education and related services to the student in accordance with the student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) or, for students entitled to FAPE under Section 504, consistent with a plan developed to meet the requirements of Section 504. The Department understands there may be exceptional circumstances that could affect how a particular service is provided.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>In addition, an IEP/IFSP Team and, as appropriate to an individual student who experiences a disability, the personnel responsible for ensuring FAPE to a student for the purposes of Section 504, would be required to make an individualized determination as to whether compensatory services are needed to make up for any skills that may have been lost because of an extended school closure.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>If a district and/or school can comply with <a href="/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=36192">Governor Brown’s guidance</a>, then, a district and/or school or ECSE program can continues to provide educational opportunities to the general student population during a school closure (or in the case of ECSE, to some students in the program), the school or ECSE program must ensure that students who experience disabilities also have equal access to the same opportunities, including the provision of FAPE. (34 CFR§§ 104.4, 104.33 (Section 504) and 28 CFR § 35.130 (Title II of the ADA)). SEAs, LEAs, schools, and ECSE programs must ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, each student who experiences a disability can be provided the special education and related services identified in the student’s IEP/IFSP developed under IDEA, or a plan developed under Section 504. (34 CFR §§ 300.101 and 300.201 (IDEA), and 34 CFR § 104.33 (Section 504))."</p>

Also, please refer to guidance from the US Department of Education via the following links. There is rich and important information embedded within them:</p>

 </ul>
<div>
 </div>
<p>When a student who experiences a disability is classified as needing homebound instruction because of a medical problem, as ordered by a physician, and is home for an extended period of time (generally more than 10 consecutive school days), an Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting or Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) meeting is necessary to change the student’s placement and the contents of the student’s IEP/IFSP, if warranted.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Further, if the IEP/IFSP goals will remain the same and only the time in special education will change, then the IEP/IFSP Team may add an amendment to the IEP/IFSP stating specifically the amount of time to be spent in special education.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>If a student with a disability is absent for an extended period of time because of a COVID-19 infection and the school or ECSE program remains open, then the IEP/IFSP Team must determine whether the student is available for instruction and requires homebound services such as online or virtual instruction, instructional telephone calls, and other curriculum-based instructional activities, to the extent available. In so doing, school and ECSE personnel should follow appropriate health guidelines to assess and address the risk of transmission in the provision of such services. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>The Department understands there may be exceptional circumstances that could affect how a particular service is provided.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>If a student does not receive services after an extended period of time, a school or ECSE Program must make an individualized determination whether and to what extent compensatory services may be needed, consistent with applicable requirements, including to make up for any skills that may have been lost.</p>

<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="studentsv" id="studentsv"><strong>May an IEP/IFSP Team consider a distance learning plan in a student’s IEP/IFSP as a contingency plan during the closure and after district, schools, and EI/ECSE providers reopen? </strong>March 18</a> <br>A: Yes. IEP/IFSP teams may, but are generally not required to, include distance learning plans in a student’s IEP/IFSP that could be triggered and implemented during any unexpected closures, including those due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Such plans would only be required if the IEP or IFSP team determined it was necessary in order to provide the student with FAPE. These plans give the student’s service providers and the student’s parents an opportunity to reach consensus as to what circumstances would trigger the use of the student’s distance learning plan and the services that would be provided during the closure. If developed, such plans may include the provision of special education and related services at an alternate location or the provision of online or virtual instruction, instructional telephone calls, and other developmental or curriculum-based instructional activities, and may identify which special education and related services, if any, could be provided at the student’s home. Districts, schools, and programs are not required to create a distance learning plan during the Statewide School Closure announced on March 12, but should implement any such plans that already exist. </p>

Days when schools, districts, or ECSE programs are closed (e.g., during the Statewide School Closure announced on March 12) <strong>do not </strong>count towards the timeline, similar to snow days.

During this time period, a student’s parent or other IEP/IFSP team member may request an IEP/IFSP meeting to discuss the potential need for services if the exclusion is likely to be of long duration (generally more than 10 consecutive school days). For long-term exclusions, an LEA or ECSE program must consider placement decisions under the IDEA’s procedural protections of 34 CFR §§ 300.115 – 300.116, regarding the continuum of alternative placements and the determination of placements.</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>Under 34 CFR § 300.116, a change in placement decision must be made by a group of persons, including the parents and other persons knowledgeable about the student and the placement options. If the placement group determines that the student meets established high-risk criteria and, due to safety and health concerns, the student’s needs could be met through homebound instruction, then under 34 CFR §300.503(a)(1), the public agency must issue a prior written notice proposing the change in placement.

<p>For students who experience disabilities protected by Section 504 who are dismissed from school during an outbreak of COVID-19 because they are at high risk for health complications, compliance with the procedures described above and completion of any necessary evaluations of the student satisfy the evaluation, placement and procedural requirements of 34 CFR §§ 104.35 and 104.36. The decision to dismiss a student based on his or her high risk for medical complications must be based on the individual needs of the student and not on perceptions of the student’s needs based merely on stereotypes or generalizations regarding their disability.</p>

For example, a district or ECSE program may use IDEA Part B funds to disseminate health and COVID-19 information that is specifically related to students who experience disabilities, to develop emergency plans for students who experience disabilities, or to provide other information (e.g., guidance on coordination of the provision of services in alternate locations as described in Question A-5) to parties who may need such information, including school or ECSE staff responsible for implementing IEPs/IFSPs, parents of eligible students, and staff in alternate locations where special education and related services may be provided.

<div>
 </div>
<p>
A:  Homemade masks are not known to be effective in protecting the wearer against infection. Therefore, OHA does NOT recommend that healthcare personnel wear these masks when taking care of sick patients. However, if worn by a sick person, particularly with respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, they could reduce the spread of the virus. </p>

<p>
Essential education workers including nutrition personnel and bus drivers should follow more closely to the guidance for healthcare personnel. </p>

<p>
The most effective strategies to prevent infection include the physical distancing measures mandated by the Governor’s Executive Orders, along with basic hand hygiene and cough etiquette. Following CDC recommendations, OHA recognizes that use of cloth face coverings may reduce the spread of virus and help prevent those who have the virus but do not have symptoms from passing it to others. </p>

<p>
Nonetheless, face coverings do NOT change the need to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid all social and recreational activities in which a distance of 6 feet between individuals cannot be maintained;</li>
<li>Maintain at least 6 feet of distance from others during any necessary trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, or healthcare entities; </li>
<li>Cover one’s cough or sneeze with a tissue and discard it immediately; or cough or sneeze into one’s upper sleeve rather than into one’s hands; </li>
<li>Avoid touching one’s eyes, nose, mouth, or face; </li>
<li>Clean your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if handwashing is not possible; and</li>
<li>If sick, isolate oneself and stay away from work, family, and friends until 72 hours after both fever and cough have resolved, without the use of fever-reducing medication. </li>
</ul>
<p>
This guidance is dynamic and evolving; we will continue to provide additional clarity if we learn more about best practices in the workplace or specifically to schools. Here’s CDC guidance dated April 3rd. Here’s OHA guidance issued April 4th. </p>

Is this a concern I need to worry about? What can I do to assure staff that every precaution is taken for their safety? </strong> (April 7)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>A: If the school will be the distribution site, set up a system to maintain social distance. Have “grab and go” packets to minimize contact. Follow CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/guidance-for-schools.html">Interim Guidance for Administrators of US K-12 Schools and Childcare Programs</a> which has information on maintaining a healthy and safe school environment during this COVID pandemic. While there is a theoretical risk that virus can be present on paper and other surfaces, this risk should be managed by encouraging strict handwashing by both school staff as well as students before touching their faces. This would be true for both educational packets as well as food distribution. </p>

The following excerpt most directly answers this question:</p>
<div>
 </div>
<p><em>Although educational agencies and institutions can often address threats to the health or safety of students or other individuals in a manner that does not identify a particular student, FERPA permits educational agencies and institutions to disclose, without prior written consent, PII from student education records to appropriate parties in connection with an emergency, if knowledge of that information is necessary to protect the health or safety of a student or other individuals. 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(1)(I); 34 C.F.R. §§ 99.31(a)(10) and 99.36. This “health or safety emergency” exception to FERPA’s general consent requirement is limited in time to the period of the emergency and generally does not allow for a blanket release of PII from student education records. Typically, law enforcement officials, public health officials, trained medical personnel, and parents (including parents of an eligible student) are the types of appropriate parties to whom PII from education records may be disclosed under this FERPA exception.</em></p>

<br><h4>Transportation</h4>
<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="transportd" id="transportd"><strong>Given Governor’s Executive Order 20-08, what are allowable expenses that can be reimbursed under the Transportation Grant in the State School Fund? </strong> (April 7)</a><br></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>A: School districts should first review their contracts with legal counsel to identify what they are responsible to pay when contracted transportation services are not provided due to school closures outlined in Executive Order 20-08. If a district determines they are liable to pay a portion, or the full amount of the contract, this would be considered an allowable expense under the Transportation Grant in the State School Fund. Because of the variety of contracts and agreements around the state, it will be difficult for ODE to provide a universal response or legal advice to address every situation; therefore, this should be a local decision guided by legal review. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>There are options to continue some level of transportation service while schools are closed. The Executive Order 20-08 allows the State School Fund’s Transportation Grant to be used for providing school meals in non-congregate settings through the Summer Food Service Program and Seamless Summer Option and for delivery of items in Section 4a of Executive Order 20-08, including learning materials, technology, and wifi access. Also, public schools may use the Transportation Grant to support the transportation of children to and from school-based child care. </p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>In addition to the Transportation Grant, additional funds will be provided through the Federal CARES Act. While there will be more information provided in the upcoming weeks, the CARES Act will provide for an Education Stabilization Fund that provides resources to help school districts in the continuity of education services to Oregon’s students and addresses challenges created through the current coronavirus emergency. The Act states that “to the greatest extent practicable” districts shall “continue to pay its employees and contractors during the period of any disruptions or closures related to coronavirus.” </p>

<p><a href="/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Pages/COVID-19-FAQ.aspx" class="odeJumpBuffer" name="transportc" id="transportc"><strong>If a district’s contract does not require them to pay their provider during school closure, but the district wants to pay them anyway to assure that the provider can maintain its services in the future, are those payments reimbursable? </strong> (April 7)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>A: Within Governor Executive Order 20-08, provisions are provided to extend school closures until April 28, 2020. Based on this Order, school districts must assume that schools will reopen on April 29, 2020, at which time transportation services will be necessary to continue education services. As such, transportation service contractors, similar to school employees, must be maintained in order to ensure these services are readily available when school reopens. Therefore, school districts may use the Transportation Grant in the State School Fund to reimburse these contracts (up to the applicable percentage) through the closure period so long as the contracts can be used to provide transportation services, in accordance to the Order, for delivering meals in non-congregate settings to eligible school sites (meaning any place meals are delivered); transporting children to and from school-based child care; and/or helping facilitate distant learning through the Governor’s directive. Additionally, because of the variety of contracts and agreements around the state, it will be difficult for ODE to provide a universal response or legal advice to address every situation; therefore, decisions should be guided by legal review. </p>

<div>
 </div>
<p>A: The maximum number of students transported at any one time would be dependent on the size of the transport vehicle and the current recommendations from either local, state and/or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for social distancing. Currently, CDC recommendations advise maintaining a distance of approximately 6 feet from others when possible and students should be seated in a manner that aligns with current guidance. </p>

With the latest guidance from Governor Brown, are we still ok to do so? We will practice the six foot rules.</strong> (April 7)</a></p>
<div>
 </div>
<p>A: Under Executive Order 20-08, the Governor has authorized the use of transportation services to assist in the delivery of meals and childcare. Additionally, the Order, under Section 4a, directs school districts as part of receiving State School Funds, to deliver supplemental education and learning support to the extent practical through independent study and other appropriate options. Under Section 5 of the Order that directs ODE to provide further guidance in the execution of Section 4, the Department has determined that the Transportation Grant, a funding source within the State School Fund, may be used to reimburse transportation services for not only the delivery of meals and childcare as specifically identified in the Order, but also to facilitate the delivery of supplemental and distant learning such as educational learning materials, technology, and wi-fi. Therefore, school districts may use their bus routes to deliver meals, technology, and learning packets to students, and treat it as reimbursable expense through the State School Fund’s Transportation Grant.</p>
