			<span class="text rteSpan">Please use the file that is attached below for clickable links.  The information has been cut and pasted below so that users can access the content via different languages and formats.<br><br>Q:  What will become of the spring sports season?<br>A:  On Tuesday, April 21, Nassau and Suffolk County school superintendents and athletic administrators announced the cancellation of the spring sports season amid health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 outbreak.  With includes the remainder of the high school season and entire middle school season.<br><br>Q:  Can school district construction projects continue through the pandemic?<br>A:  It depends.  Schools are considered government entities and essential services, and thus we continue to operate on a limited basis.  Construction projects may continue, provided that the vendor and district can maintain appropriate social distancing and cleaning/disinfecting protocols.  Thus, a few of our essential construction projects will continue.<br><br>Q:  Are there Smithtown Library resources that students and parents can access at home?<br>A:  Yes.  In Suffolk, most libraries have extended their Wi-Fi into their parking lots, so if a child does not have access at home, he/she may go to the parking lot of the library to gain access.  There are services, like Hoopla, that are now free. Hoopla is an online database where you can borrow unlimited books, music, and/or digital movies, with your library card https://www.hoopladigital.com/.  <br><br>The public library also has a large number of online databases that students and teachers can access.  Click on the following link to access a list of the elementary databases available: https://smithlib.org/resources/databases/homework-help.html    There are also many online databases for the middle and high school level students as well.<br><br>Q:  Can I still get a Chromebook for my child?<br>A:  Unfortunately, right now the answer is no.  Given the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases presently in Kings Park and numerous Executive Orders by the Governor, we are not able to accommodate any additional requests at the present time. <br><br>Q:  When might school reopen?<br>A:  On April 16, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York’s stay-at-home measures, including closing schools, will continue either until or through May 15 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The continued shutdown will be done in coordination with six other states in the Northeast (CT, DE, MA, NJ, PA, RI).  The prior executive order closed schools through April 29, suggesting the closure will be through Friday, May 15. In that case, schools would reopen the following Monday, May 18, unless otherwise ordered by the governor or other authorities.  <br><br>Q:  Can I come up to school and get something for my child?<br>A:  Generally, no.  By Executive order from the Governor, our schools are closed, and we only have a skeleton crew of essential staff in and out of our buildings on a daily basis.  However, if your child needs something essential, we may be able to arrange for a quick pick-up.  Please note that there is a vast difference between want and need.  Only requests for essential items will be considered.  Please note that we have not emptied any lockers.  They are still very much safe and secure.    <br><br>Q:  When will the school district budget vote and elections be held?<br>A:  The Governor has postponed school district budget votes and board elections until “at least June 1.”  The April 7, 2020 Budget Adoption presentation was postponed and will be rescheduled.  We will continue to work on developing the 2020-2021 school district budget once we receive more direction from the state.<br><br>Q:  Is the district continuing to provide meals for students that qualify for free or reduced priced lunch?<br>A:  Yes.  During the crisis, the school district has been providing upwards of 250 meals daily.  The School District is running a “Grab and Go” breakfast/lunch program in the main lobby at Kings Park High School.  This service is being provided from 8:00 – 10:00 a.m. Monday – Friday.  In addition, for families without transportation or a way to get to KPHS to grab and go, we are running a Breakfast Bus Monday – Friday, also from 8:00 – 10:00 a.m.  If you would like more information regarding how you might be added to the Breakfast Bus’s schedule, kindly email either Joanne Allyson (allysonj@kpcsd.org) or Dr. Colby-Rooney (colbyd@kpcsd.org).  Again, the bus is only for those families with no way to get to KPHS to grab and go.  <br><br>Q:  Are food pantries operating in the Kings Park area?<br>A:  Yes.<br>Island Harvest Food Pantry has many sites in the surrounding area.<br>Go to their website, https://www.islandharvest.org and search by zip code to find a location nearby. Please find below a listing of a few of the closest pantries to Kings Park. <br><br>Salvation Army - East Northport; 631-368-1170; 319 Clay Pitts Road, East Northport, NY 11731 (Tuesday and Thursday 10AM-3PM)<br><br>Manna Ministries; 631-334-1612; 782 Larkfield Road, East Northport, NY 11731 (Wednesday 6PM-8:30PM)<br><br>St. Francis of Assisi - St. Vincent de Paul; 631-651-2655; 29 North Gate Drive, Greenlawn, NY 11750 (Monday through Friday 9AM-3:30PM)<br><br>To those families that wish to contribute: If you would like to contribute towards those in need at this time, please refer to the Island Harvest website. You can volunteer or donate funds from the comfort of your own home if you so choose. https://www.islandharvest.org <br>Additionally, LI CARES has been able to make arrangements to dispatch mobile units as well, as a large number of local restaurants are looking to donate food. People can call (631) 582-FOOD. <br><br>LI Cares needs volunteers at all our locations to help sort and pack food. They are accepting small groups (less than six), creating schedules to avoid overlapping, and to keep people safe and comfortable. Potential volunteers can call (631) 582-FOOD.<br><br>Q:  How is the school district providing for continuity of learning during the COVID-19 crisis?<br>A:  In accordance with the guidance provided by The State Education Department, our teachers have developed plans to best provide for continuity of learning while our schools are closed.  As shared by the Superintendent in prior correspondences, we are leveraging teacher and school websites, various online applications, Remind, Google Classroom, Zoom videoconferencing, and email for communication and posting of learning activities.  It is important for our students to understand that there is work for them to complete, and work will be graded where possible and applicable.  If you have any questions, please email your child’s teacher directly.  They have been instructed to post daily activities for students and check email regularly while working from home.  You can also email your school’s principal.  Each principal has been communicating with parents and sharing information specific to their school via eblast.  On the website, each school has a “Contact Us” tab on the top right side of the homepage.  Scroll down to “Teacher &amp; Staff Directory.”  You can then click on an individual staff member to access their personal webpage and email contact information.<br><br>Q:  What should I do if I can’t find my teacher’s email address?<br>A:  The email account convention that we use here in Kings Park is last name followed by the first initial of the person’s first name @KPCSD.org.  So, Thomas Smith would become smitht@kpcsd.org.  <br><br>Q: How are teachers communicating with students and parents regarding assignments, new material, testing, etc.<br>A: Teachers are communicating with parents and students via Google Classroom, email, apps like Remind, phone, through postings to their individual websites, and through synchronous and asynchronous video.  <br><br>Q: Will teachers be checking and answering emails daily?<br>A: Yes, teachers are checking their emails. The frequency depends on the needs of the students and their own health.<br><br>Q:  What is going to happen with Quarters 3 and 4 on the secondary level, and how will grades be calculated?<br>A:  We will be following the district calendar and ending the 3rd Quarter on April 7th. Numeric grades will be assigned for students for all classes for Quarter 3. A "do no harm" plan will be used for Quarter 3. Teachers have discretion and flexibility to include graded online learning assignments between March 13 and April 7 if it helps the student.  Additionally, Quarter 3 course grades that harm a student’s overall average will be taken out of a student's final grade for the year. Quarter 4 will begin as planned.  Information on Quarter 4 grading, specifically special area classes, will be coming soon.<br><br>Q:  What do I do if we do not have Wi-Fi at home?<br>A:  Altice (Optimum) is allowing all residents to connect to their hot spots. This means any Optimum Wi-Fi signal you can “see” on your device (in Settings: Wi-Fi options) will be available for you to use free. The number to call is 1-866-200-9522 to set this up. <br><br>Another option for Wi-Fi may be to call your cell phone provider and ask them to "enable mobile hotspot" on your plan. I am told that Sprint and AT&amp;T have already enabled this at no cost to customers. To check to see if you have it, go to your device Settings and Connections and turn on “Personal Hotspot” or "Mobile Hotspot." It may not be available without subscription from some providers, but it can't hurt to call your provider and ask!<br><br>Q:  What do I do if I need technology assistance?<br>A:  Even though our schools and offices are closed, we are still reachable to assist you with technology issues.  You can get help by: <br>•	Visiting this newly created help page:  https://sites.google.com/kpcsd.org/remote-learning-help<br>As suggested, we have included a few screencasts to help students and parents navigate through some of the things that were causing some confusion and difficulties. Edits and additions will be made as time goes on, so please don’t hesitate to continue to send suggestions and input for us to include. We also added a link to this site on our district website which can be found on the “Digital Learning Tools &amp; Applications” page under the Parents and Students menu and as a link under Technology. <br>•	Calling (631) 269-3318 	Leave a message, with a brief summary of the issue and a phone number or email where you can be reached.  We will then contact you to assist.<br>•	Emailing helpdesk@kpcsd.org <br><br>Q:  If I am a first responder of healthcare worker, how do I find childcare?<br>A:  Please see the specific guidance that is provided in the “News and Announcements” section on the website, or simply click HERE.<br><br>Q:  What is the status of the Kings Park Spring Adult Education Program?<br>A:  Based on the most recent guidance from the Department of Health, the spring semester of adult education has been cancelled.  The school district will be issuing full refunds.  We understand this is disappointing news for all who planned on participating.  However, at this time, the health and safety of our community is our priority. Thank you in advance for your patience, as we have to issue over 300 individual checks.  This may take 6 to 8 weeks, as it is a lengthy process.<br><br>Q:  What happens to my MySchoolBucks (School Lunch) account while school is not in session?<br>A:  Please be advised that if there are currently funds within your child(ren) MySchoolBucks account(s), the balance will carry forward until we return to school. This is also the case at the end of each school year. Any balances are carried forward into the following school year. <br><br>Q:  Is the Board of Education continuing to meet during the COVID-19 crisis?<br>A:  Yes.  The Board of Education will continue to meet during the COVID-19 crisis for the purpose of conducting the business of the school district.  Please visit our website for details.<br><br>Q: Will the district lose April break?<br>A: Essentially, yes.  The Governor directed school districts to continue to provide three essential services, even if the district was scheduled to be on “recess” in April.  These three essential services are:  continuity of learning, meals for students, and childcare for first responders and healthcare workers.  Since none of us are likely traveling in the coming weeks, keeping busy and mentally and physically engaged is essential.  Families and employees should take time for religious observance.  <br><br>Q:  If schools reopen, will students be required to test negative for COVID-19 or submit proof of vaccination/inoculation in order to return to school?<br>A:  Schools are required to follow Education Law and guidance from the New York State Department of Health.  We would certainly need to implement any changes in the law or directives that we receive from our government related to COVID-19.<br><br>Q: Will students go to school past the current last day of school in June?<br>A: Although the Governor has provided information about the 180-day requirement, there are still many unknowns with regard to the school calendar determination for the remainder of this school year. At this point it is unlikely that the school year would extend past June 26, but we will need to wait for specific guidance from the Governor and The State Education Department.<br><br>Q:  What is the status of the NYS Grades 3-8 testing program for 2019-2020?<br>A:  That State Education Department has cancelled ALL grades 3-8 examinations scheduled for this spring.<br><br>Q:  What is the status of Regents Exams for this June?<br>A:  On April 6, NYS Board of Regents Chancellor Betty Rosa announced that Regents Examinations for this June will be cancelled.  The following additional guidance was received from The NYS Department of Education on Tuesday, April 7.  <br>Students who, during the June 2020 examination period would have taken one or more Regents examinations, will be exempted from passing the assessments in order to be issued a diploma.  To qualify for the exemption, students must meet one of the following eligibility requirements:<br>•	The student is currently enrolled in a course of study culminating in a Regents examination and will have earned credit in such course of study by the end of the 2019-20 school year; or<br>•	The student is in grade 7, is enrolled in a course of study culminating in a Regents examination and will have passed such course of study by the end of the 2019-20 school year; or<br>•	The student is currently enrolled in a course of study culminating in a Regents examination and has failed to earn credit by the end of the school year. Such student returns for summer instruction to make up the failed course and earn the course credit and is subsequently granted diploma credit in August 2020; or<br>•	The student was previously enrolled in the course of study leading to an applicable Regents examination, has achieved course credit, and has not yet passed the associated Regents examination but intended to take the test in June 2020 to achieve a passing score.<br><br>Further information on this topic from The NYS Education Department can be found here:<br>•	announced the cancellation of the June 2020 administration of Regents Exams and <br>•	released guidance on modifications to requirements for students to graduate and earn their high school diplomas, credentials and endorsements.<br>•	frequently asked questions document<br><br>There has been no decision about the August 2020 schedule of Regents examinations. <br><br>Q:  What is the status of SAT and ACT testing for later this spring?<br>A:  Below is a summary of what we have received from both the ACT and College Board to date:<br>•	April 4 ACT @ KPHS – CANCELLED by ACT<br>•	May 2 SAT @ KPHS – CANCELLED by College Board<br>•	June 6 SAT @ KPHS – TBD <br>•	June 13 ACT @ KPHS – TBD<br><br>Q: What is the status of Advanced Placement (AP) testing later this spring?<br>A: We received the following information from the College Board on April 3.

Students will need to write and submit their responses within the allotted time for each question. <br>•	Students will be able to take exams on any device they have access to—computer, tablet, or smartphone. They'll be able to type and upload their responses or write responses by hand and submit a photo via their cell phones.  <br>•	For most subjects, the exams will be 45 minutes long, plus an additional 5 minutes for uploading. Students will need to access the online testing system 30 minutes early to get set up. <br>•	Certain courses—Art and Design: 2D; Art and Design: 3D; Computer Science Principles; Drawing; Research; and Seminar—will use portfolio submissions and will not have a separate online exam. All deadlines for these submissions have been extended to May 26, 2020, 11:59 p.m. ET. Teachers and students may receive separate course-specific communications.<br>•	Students taking world language and culture exams will complete two spoken tasks consistent with free-response questions 3 and 4 on the current AP Exam. Written responses will not be required. We'll provide additional details in the coming weeks to help students prepare.<br><br>Exam Scores and College Credit<br>•	As usual, students' work will be scored by our network of college faculty and AP teachers, and will be reported on a 1–5 scale. We anticipate releasing scores as close to the usual July timeframe as possible.<br>•	We're confident that the vast majority of higher ed institutions will award college credit as they have in the past. We've spoken with hundreds of institutions across the country that support our solution for this year's AP Exams.<br><br>Exam Security<br>•	Like many college-level exams, this year's AP Exams will be open book/open note. The exam format and questions are being designed specifically for an at-home administration, so points will not be earned from content that can be found in textbooks or online. However, students taking the exams may not consult with any other individuals during the testing period. We'll take the necessary steps to protect the integrity of each exam administration, as we do every year.<br>•	We're confident that the vast majority of AP students will follow the rules for taking the exams. For the small number of students who may try to gain an unfair advantage, we have a comprehensive and strict set of protocols in place to prevent and detect cheating. While some of these practices are confidential to maximize their effectiveness, students and education professionals can learn more about our security measures.<br>•	At a minimum, test takers should understand that those attempting to gain an unfair advantage will either be blocked from testing or their AP scores will be canceled, and their high school will be notified as will colleges or other organizations to which the student has already sent any College Board scores (including SAT® scores). And they may be prohibited from taking a future Advanced Placement® Exam as well as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests™, or CLEP® assessments.<br><br>Q:  How do I submit my request for private and parochial transportation for 2020-2021?<br>A:  April 1 is typically the deadline, but please note that due to the closure of schools pursuant to the Executive Order(s) issued by the Governor for the COVID-19 crisis and recognizing that such requests need to be incorporated into a school district’s budget, NYSED directed all public school districts to accept all parental requests for transportation to charter and nonpublic schools submitted on or before April 15, 2020.   The deadline is usually April 1.  NYSED deems such Executive Order(s) be a reasonable excuse for a delay under Ed. Law 3635.  You can either mail your request and make sure it is postmarked April 15 or earlier, or scan and email your request to:  lees@kpcsd.org.</span><br><ul class="fbList">
