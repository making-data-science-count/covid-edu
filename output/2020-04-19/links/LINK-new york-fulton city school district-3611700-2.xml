<br><strong>April 3, 2020</strong><br>
 <br><strong>Dear Fulton City School District Families:</strong><br>
 <br>
It is hard to imagine that our schools have been closed for three weeks as of today. We have definitely missed our students and families during this time. Although our school buildings are closed, our faculty and staff are working hard to provide learning at home and school meals for our students, as well as regular check-ins to help us maintain our sense of belonging within our school community. We are learning to build our growth mindset and try new things every day!<br>
 <br><strong><em>Please read our updates carefully, check our web site at </em></strong><a href="http://www.fultoncsd.org/"><strong><em><u>www.fultoncsd.org</u></em></strong> </a><strong><em>and do not hesitate to contact us at 315-593-5509 with any questions.</em></strong><br>
 
<h3><u>Spring Break</u></h3>
Due to the extended school closure ordered by Governor Cuomo as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, <strong>we will continue to provide school meals and learning at home resources during the time that was originally scheduled as spring break (April 6-10 and April 13). </strong>We will also work with our community partners to ensure there are plans in place for child care for essential workers. This action is required, by Executive Order, to ensure that our schools will continue to be eligible for all allocated state aid, which makes up the majority of our school district funding.<br>
 
<h3><u>Schedule for Schools To Reopen</u></h3>
At this time, the Governor’s order closes schools until April 15. The Governor has stated that he will review and extend closures as needed in two week time periods. We will provide updates as we receive them.<br>
 
<h3><u>School Meals</u></h3>
Please note that beginning the week of April 6, school meals will be distributed on <strong>Tuesdays and Thursdays</strong>. <strong>Meals will not be distributed on Fridays</strong>. An updated <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PE3xFlxLca7pEfvYqyP_bPBWcCpD-FSa/view?usp=sharing">meal schedule </a>is enclosed.<br>
 <br><strong><u><a href="https://sites.google.com/fulton.cnyric.org/fcsdlearningathome">Learning at Home</a></u></strong><br><br><strong>Week 3 (April 1 - April 10)</strong><br>
Materials for week three were posted (Grades 3-12) or mailed (K-2) on April 1. The learning activities provided this week should be completed by Monday, April 13. This time frame includes our originally scheduled spring break, which will now be used to continue learning. No materials will be posted or mailed on April 8, as the materials for week three are intended to extend through April 10.</div>
<br clear="all"><strong>Week 4 (April 13-17): </strong>In anticipation that schools may remain closed beyond April 15, we have planned to begin <strong>new learning and a new weekly schedule </strong>on Monday, April 13.

<ul>
<li>Materials and learning activities will be posted using Google Classroom and can be accessed through our <a href="https://sites.google.com/fulton.cnyric.org/fcsdlearningathome">Learning at Home </a>site. We will continue to mail materials to students in grades K- 2 and others without internet access.</li>
	<li>Also beginning the week of April 13, teachers will hold office hours Monday-Friday so families can contact them with questions and for additional support with learning. Office hours will be posted on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/fulton.cnyric.org/fcsdlearningathome">Learning at Home </a>site for each class/grade next to teacher contact information.</li>
</ul>
 <br><strong>Grading for students in grades 7-12: </strong>Students in grades 7-12 will receive pass/fail grades <strong><em>for assignments posted beginning April 13</em></strong>. In cases where a student might not receive a “pass” on an assignment, teachers will provide additional support.<br>

 <br><strong>Technology Helpdesk</strong>: If you have difficulty with a district-issued Chromebook, please call our helpdesk at 315-593-9214.<br>
 
<h3><u>School Playgrounds and Fields</u></h3>
We have worked with the City of Fulton to put safety measures in place for our facilities that are consistent with the City’s plan. All school playgrounds, tennis courts and fields are closed at this time. While we encourage all FCSD families to get out in the fresh air to exercise their bodies and minds, use of school playgrounds and fields do not allow for appropriate physical distancing to occur. Thank you for your understanding.<br>
 <br>
We wish you well as we all continue to follow health and safety guidelines to stay at home whenever possible. As our district vision states, we will continue to work together to <strong>“<em>foster hope and resilience for the future</em></strong>.<strong>” </strong>Thank you for your kindness and support through this time.<br>

There is no question that all of us have had to adjust our routines and daily life.

 <br><strong>Third Quarter Grades and Assignments for Grades 7-12 (as of March 27) </strong><br>
 <br>
The third marking period is scheduled to end on April 3. Given that schools were closed prior to the end of the third marking period, many teachers did not have an opportunity to enter grades or give remaining assignments and quizzes. Therefore, when school resumes, the third marking period will be extended to April 24 for students in grades 7-12. It is important to note the following:<br>
 
<ul>
<li>Throughout the period of the emergency closing (March 16-April 14), students need to be working on all assignments that were assigned and due up to and including March 13. SchoolTool will be updated to include these assignments once submitted.</li>
	<li>No new teacher instruction will take place during the period of March 16- April 14 (except as required for AP and college classes).</li>
</ul>
 <br><strong>Third Quarter Grades for Grades K-6 (as of March 27) </strong><br>
 
<ul>
<li>In grades K-6 we <strong>will not </strong>be submitting third quarter grades. We will wait and combine the third and fourth quarters. This will allow us to resume our regular instructional routine when we transition back to school.</li>
</ul>
 <br><strong>School Meals </strong><br>
 <br>
Starting the week of March 30, school meals will be distributed on <strong>Tuesdays and Fridays only</strong>. For schedule and locations, please see below. School meals will continue to be available during the timeframe that is scheduled as spring break (April 6-13).<br>
 <br><strong>Child Care for Essential Workers </strong><br>
 <br>
NYS has asked all school districts to send out a survey to families in order to determine the need for emergency child care services in our community. The Office of Child and Family Services (OCFS) is collecting information from this survey in order to help families find the high-quality child care that they need. <strong>If you are a parent or caregiver who needs child care in order to work in an essential job, please complete this <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3HSNNYJ">survey</a></strong>. Please go to our website at <a href="http://www.fultoncsd.org">http://www.fultoncsd.org</a> to take the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3HSNNYJ">survey</a>.

However, we know that plans can change rapidly based directives from local, state and federal level officials as they respond to this public health crisis. We will keep you posted regarding any changes as we learn about them.<br>

Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID 19 in our community, Oswego County has declared a state of emergency out of an abundance of caution to slow or reduce the spread of COVID-19.<br><br><b>Therefore, all schools will be closed beginning tomorrow, Monday, March 16 through and including Monday, April 13. All activities and events in this time frame are cancelled. At this time, we plan to resume a regular school schedule on Tuesday, April 14. We will communicate any changes to this plan as the situation unfolds.<br><br>
While school is closed, we have planned to provide meals, educational resources and community-based social emotional resources to Fulton City School District students.<br><br>
If you have questions or concerns, please call 315-593-5509.</b><br><br><strong><u>Beginning on March 17</u></strong>, free meals will be provided to all students enrolled in the Fulton City School District each week day between the hours of 8:30 am and 11:30 am in the locations listed below. Meal distribution will occur outside the buildings in the parking lots. All children under the age of 18 are eligible for these free meals as long as one child in the household is enrolled in Fulton City Schools.</p>

<br><br><strong>Medication</strong><br><br>
All Fulton City School District health offices will be open from 11:00 am - 3:00 pm on March 16 for parents/guardians to pick up any necessary medications that are kept at school.<br><br><strong>Learning at Home</strong><br><br>
District teams have planned for the possibility of a school closure by preparing collections of paper-based educational resources that will be mailed to all students’ homes early this week.<br><br>
Each student mailing will contain grade-level specific academic activities that are designed to help students continue their learning while at home. The activities are extensions of the learning that your children participate in each day at school. Each mailing will include:<br><br>
• one week’s worth of daily activities in ELA, Math, and SEL for grades K-8; and practice/ preparation resources aligned with Regents Exams for high school students<br>
• answer keys and support resources for parents<br>
• a list of additional suggestions for online and other educational resources<br><br>
Please also continue to check www.fultoncsd.org for updated information and resources.<br><br><strong>Social Emotional Health</strong><br><br>
We share your concerns about how coronavirus (COVID-19) is impacting your family and our community. Many are feeling anxious and overwhelmed by the health, social and financial impacts of the virus and efforts to prevent its spread. During school closures we want you to know that we will still be here to provide support and help you make connections to the community organizations that can assist in times of crisis. We have attached a list of frequently requested contacts.<br><br>
We hope that you will stay well and that you will reach out to us if we can assist you.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br><br><strong>Brian T. Pulvino</strong><br>
Superintendent
