 </p>

<p>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease that can result in serious illness or death. It is caused by a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans and easily spread from person to person. There is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for this disease.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On March 10, 2020, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services identified the first two presumptive-positive cases of COVID-19 in Michigan. On that same day, I issued Executive Order 2020-4. This order declared a state of emergency across the state of Michigan under section 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, the Emergency Management Act, 1976 PA 390, as amended, MCL 30.401-.421, and the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945, 1945 PA 302, as amended, MCL 10.31-.33.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the three weeks that followed, the virus spread across Michigan, bringing deaths in the hundreds, confirmed cases in the thousands, and deep disruption to this state’s economy, homes, and educational, civic, social, and religious institutions. In response to the widespread and severe health, economic, and social harms posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I issued Executive Order 2020-33 on April 1, 2020. This order expanded on Executive Order 2020-4 and declared both a state of emergency and a state of disaster across the state of Michigan under section 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, the Emergency Management Act, and the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Emergency Management Act vests the governor with broad powers and duties to “cop[e] with dangers to this state or the people of this state presented by a disaster or emergency,” which the governor may implement through “executive orders, proclamations, and directives having the force and effect of law.” MCL 30.403(1)-(2). Similarly, the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945 provides that, after declaring a state of emergency, “the governor may promulgate reasonable orders, rules, and regulations as he or she considers necessary to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation within the affected area under control.” MCL 10.31(1).</p>

<p> </p>
 

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has already required, among other things, the closure of elementary and secondary schools throughout the state. Given virus’s aggressively persistent spread and potentially fatal consequences, in-person instruction in our schools is too dangerous to resume in the near future, and very likely for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. Nonetheless, as section 1 of article 8 of the Michigan Constitution provides, “schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” In the face of this pandemic, the education of K-12 students must continue as fully and effectively as possible. While there is no substitute for a highly trained and experienced teacher interacting with students in a classroom, schools must continue to provide, and students must continue to receive, the highest level of educational opportunities possible under the difficult circumstances now before us. To do so, schools and students alike must be enabled to innovate and adapt, and those efforts must not be unduly inhibited by requirements or restrictions that are misplaced in this time of unprecedented crisis.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Accordingly, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, protect the health and safety of this state and its residents, and ensure the ongoing encouragement of education enshrined in this state’s constitution, it is reasonable and necessary to temporarily suspend in-person instruction of K-12 students and provide limited and temporary relief from certain restrictions and requirements so that K-12 education may continue by the best alternative means possible.</p>

<p> </p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>Acting under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:</p>

<p> </p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in;"><strong>I.   Suspension of in-person K-12 instruction for the remainder of 2019-2020 school year</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">A.  Except as provided in section III of this order, in-person instruction for pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 (“K-12”) is suspended for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year and school buildings used for the provision of K-12 education must remain closed for the purpose of providing K-12 education in person for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year, unless restrictions on public gatherings and use of school buildings are lifted before the end of the 2019-2020 school year. K-12 school sports activities and other in-person extracurricular school activities are suspended while any state of emergency or state of disaster prompted by COVID-19 is in effect. This section I.A applies to all public, nonpublic, and boarding schools in the state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">B.  For a district implementing a Continuity of Learning and COVID-19 Response Plan (“Plan”) pursuant to section II of this order, all of the following apply:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">1.   Strict compliance with rules and procedures under subdivisions (d) to (f) of subsection (3) of section 101 of the State School Aid Act of 1979 (“School Aid Act”), 1979 PA 94, as amended, MCL 388.1701(3)(d) to (f), is temporarily suspended for the period beginning on March 11, 2020 and ending on the last day of the 2019-2020 school year, so as to waive any requirement that a district have a minimum number of the district’s membership in attendance on any day of pupil instruction and waive any requirement that a district report the percentage of the district’s membership in attendance to the Department of Education (“Department”).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">2.   Strict compliance with rules and procedures under sections 101(3)(a), 101(3)(b), 101(4), 101(6), and 101(10) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701(3)(a), 388.1701(3)(b), 388.1701(4), 388.1701(6), and 388.1701(10), requiring a district to provide at least 1,098 hours and 180 days of pupil instruction, is temporarily suspended so as to provide for the following additional exceptions to the requirement to provide at least 1,098 hours and 180 days of pupil instruction that must be counted as hours and days of pupil instruction:</p>

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">(a)  In addition to counting as hours and days of pupil instruction under section 101(4) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701(4), the first six days or the equivalent number of hours for which pupil instruction is not provided because of conditions not within the control of school authorities, the Department shall count up to 13 additional days or the equivalent number of hours for which pupil instruction is not provided due to a closure of schools pursuant to an executive order issued by the governor in response to the COVID-19 state of emergency and/or state of disaster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">(b)  Under section 101(10) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701(10), a district also may count an additional five days or the equivalent number of hours used for the purpose of preparing to provide and providing instruction by alternative modes of instruction pursuant to a Plan as days or an equivalent number of hours of pupil instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">3.   Strict compliance with rules and procedures under section 101(9) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701(9), is temporarily suspended so as to permit a district that has a Department-approved alternative education program or another innovative program approved by the Department under MCL 388.1701(9) and that does not use a 100% online model of delivery approved before the effective date of this order to use the additional exceptions provided for in section I.B.2 of this order in satisfying the number of days and hours of instruction required under a waiver granted by the Department under section 101(9).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">4.   Strict compliance with rules and procedures under section 101(9) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701(9), is temporarily suspended so as to waive the minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction required under section 101(3) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701(3), for any district with a Plan approved under section II of this order. A district with a Plan approved under section II of this order will be considered to be operating a Department-approved alternative education program or another innovative program approved by the Department for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year only. A district with a Plan approved under section II of this order is not subject to forfeiture of money under section 101 of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701. If the district does not comply substantially with the terms of the Plan, the amount of any forfeiture under MCL 388.1701 will be calculated based upon a comparison of the number of hours and days of pupil instruction provided to the minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction required under MCL 388.1701(3), as affected by this order. A district with a Plan approved under section II of this order is not required to report to the Center the pupils enrolled in a Department-approved alternative education program under MCL 388.1701(9).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">C.  A school of excellence that is a cyber school, as defined in section 551 of the Revised School Code (“School Code”), 1976 PA 451, as amended, MCL 380.551, and is in compliance with section 553a of the School Code, MCL 380.553a, may continue to educate pupils in a manner consistent with section I.A of this order, and continues to be exempt from the requirements of subsections (3) and (8) of section 101 of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1701(3) and (8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">D.  If before March 11, 2020, a district was providing nonessential elective courses to nonpublic school and/or homeschool pupils at either a district, intermediate district, or nonpublic school site pursuant to section 166b of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1766b, and is able to continue to offer the nonessential elective courses through alternative modes of instruction, then the district may, to the extent feasible, provide for such courses in its Plan and continue to offer the nonessential elective courses to nonpublic school and/or homeschool pupils through alternative modes of instruction for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">E.  Nothing in this order alters the inapplicability of subsections (3) and (8) of section 101 of the School Aid Act, MCL 380.1701(3) and (8), to eligible pupils enrolled in a dropout recovery program that meets the requirements of section 23a of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1623a. As used in this section I.E, “eligible pupil” means that term as defined in MCL 388.1623a.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">F.   The approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (“Superintendent”) or the Department is not required for a district to make use of a waiver provided for under section I.B of this order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">G.  Strict compliance with rules and procedures under section 6(7)(b) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1606(7)(b), is temporarily suspended to eliminate the requirement during the 2019-2020 school year for a district or intermediate district maintaining school during the entire school year to use the fourth Wednesday in April as a pupil membership count day.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">H.  Strict compliance with rules and procedures under sections 1284 and 1284a of the School Code, MCL 380.1284 and 380.1284a, is temporarily suspended as necessary to facilitate implementation of this section I.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">I.    Strict compliance with rules and procedures under 104b(4)(b) of the School Aid Act, MCL 388.1704b(4)(b), is temporarily suspended as necessary to permit a district to include each day that a pupil is deemed in attendance under this section I or pursuant to a Plan under section II of this order as a day the pupil was in attendance at school during the 2019-2020 school year for purposes of MCL 388.1704b(4)(b).</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">D.  A district may contract with one or more providers for implementation of a Plan.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">E.  If a district lacks the capacity to implement a Plan on its own, a district may partner with one or more other districts or intermediate districts. A district may enter into one or more cooperative agreements under section 11a(4) of the School Code, MCL 380.11a(4), to provide for implementation of a Plan.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">F.   For a district that is not a public school academy, the district’s Plan must be approved by the intermediate superintendent of the intermediate district in which the district is located. For a district that is a public school academy, the district’s Plan must be approved by the authorizing body of the public school academy or the authorizing body’s designee for the purpose of administering contracts with public school academies. For a public school academy that by agreement provides public educational services for the residents of a district that does not directly provide public educational services to the residents on its own, the public school academy’s Plan must be approved by the intermediate superintendent of the intermediate district in which the public school academy is located. If an intermediate district educates K-12 students, the intermediate district may adopt a Plan for those activities and implement the Plan once adopted. A school of excellence that is a cyber school, as defined in section 551 of the School Code, MCL 380.551, and is in compliance with section 553a of the School Code, MCL 380.553a, may continue to educate pupils under its charter contract which will be that school’s Plan.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">G.  An intermediate district or an authorizing body shall approve a Plan submitted by a district if the Plan complies with the requirements of this section II and if the intermediate district or authorizing body believes the Plan represents a good-faith effort to provide adequate alternative modes of instruction given the limitations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying response efforts. Intermediate districts and authorizing bodies must allow for flexibility and presume that a Plan submitted by a district will be implemented to the best of the district’s ability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">H.  Intermediate districts and authorizing bodies shall transmit copies of approved Plans to the Superintendent and to the State Treasurer. If a district or intermediate district maintains a public internet site, the district or intermediate district shall post its approved Plan on the internet site.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">I.    An intermediate district may enter into a cooperate agreement with one or more other intermediate districts for the purpose of reviewing and approving Plans under this order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">J.   An intermediate district or authorizing body that reviews and approves or disapproves Plans on its own or with others pursuant to this section II will be eligible for any additional funding appropriated to support these activities. An intermediate district or authorizing body that does not review and approve or disapprove Plans will not be eligible for any additional funding appropriated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">K.  Intermediate districts and authorizing bodies must be prepared to review and approve or reject Plans beginning on April 8, 2020.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">L.   A district with an approved Plan is eligible to receive continued payments from the State School Aid Fund for the 2019-2020 school year.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">M.  A district that is not a public school academy may amend its Plan with the approval of the intermediate superintendent of the intermediate district in which the school district is located. A district that is a public school academy may amend its Plan with the approval of its authorizing body or its designee. For a public school academy that by agreement provides public educational services for the residents of a district that does not directly provide public educational services to the residents on its own, the public school academy’s Plan may be amended with the approval of the intermediate superintendent of the intermediate district in which the public school academy is located.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">N.  Decisions regarding the awarding of credit, the issuance of grades, and the use of pass or fail designations will be made at the district level by districts with due recognition of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:
">O.  State-approved nonpublic schools and parents and guardians homeschooling students are encouraged to do all of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.75in;">3.   Assist eligible nonpublic school students to complete postsecondary dual enrollment courses, to the extent feasible, under the Postsecondary Enrollment Options Act, 1996 PA 160, as amended, MCL 388.511 to 388.524, and the Career and Technical Preparation Act, 2000 PA 258, as amended, MCL 388.1901 to 388.1913.</p>
