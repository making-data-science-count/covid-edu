            <p class="subheading"><strong>April 17, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Dear KASD Families, </p>

<p>On April 16, Governor Evers announced that schools will be closed for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. Although this was not the outcome we had hoped for, we are grateful to have this direction so we can move forward in planning for a successful end to the school year for our students, including exploring avenues for honoring our seniors.</p>

<p>We acknowledge continued school closures are difficult for students, staff, families and our entire community.  In simplest terms, students miss their friends and teachers, and we miss our students. I am extremely proud of the way our students, teachers and families have worked together to continue meeting our students’ educational and emotional needs.</p>

<p>The extended closure raises numerous questions for students and families. We are working to answer your questions as soon as possible. In the meantime, here is what we know at this time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distance learning will continue through June 4. We are committed to continuing to partner with families and community to support our students’ learning while they are at home.</li>
	<li>We will continue to prioritize support for our high school seniors to ensure they have what they need for graduation and post-secondary transitions. </li>
	<li>We will continue to provide meals to all children during school closure. Meals are free to all children 18 years or younger.  Pickups are available at Kimberly High School or Westside Elementary School.</li>
	<li>All events, including athletics, dances and scheduled school trips, are cancelled. We are collaborating with students and staff to come up with creative alternatives to celebrate milestones such as awards night and graduation. We will keep students and families updated.</li>
	<li>We will schedule dates to pick up personal belongings and to return school materials at a later date.</li>
	<li>We are waiting for information from the Governor on whether schools will be open for summer school. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to delivering the very best education possible under these unique circumstances while also doing all we can to support students’ well-being. If you have questions, please contact your child’s teacher or school principal. </p>

<p>Thank you for your continued support and patience.</p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Robert S. Mayfield, Ed.D.<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p class="subheading"><strong>District Learning Plan</strong></p>

<p>As you know the district is closing due to the novel coronavirus. We know that many of you are asking, “What does this mean for my child and learning?” We care about your child, your family, and our community.

If you do not have a device (i.e. a computer), the district is working on getting one for you. The district is also working on a way to get supplies and books to you during the closure.  If your child receives special education services, your child's case manager will connect with you individually with the plan for services during the school closure. Please continue to read your email daily and check Infinite Campus for updates. Please stay healthy, and follow the advice of our local health department. Together we can make it through this!</p>

<p>Grade 2 - Grade 4<br>
Starting Monday, March 23, 2020, teachers will be communicating with your child through Google classroom. During the day today, we worked with your child on how to access this online platform.

This will help you stay on top of what is being asked of your child during our closure. The learning expectations during this time will be very reasonable.

<p>Dear KASD Families, <br><br>
As I am sure you are all aware, Governor Evers ordered the closure of all K-12 Wisconsin schools, public and private, as part of our efforts to respond to and contain the spread of COVID-19 in Wisconsin. The mandated closure will begin on Wednesday, March 18.<br><br>
Currently, the Kimberly Area School District does not have a confirmed case of coronavirus or COVID-19 in our schools; but it is important that our families and staff know that KASD is keeping track of this situation.</p>

<p>School will be held Monday, March 16, and Tuesday, March 17. During this time, we will be preparing students for the transition to online learning. Please know we are committed to providing available resources to support our families and more information will be shared next week.  </p>

<p>As a parent, you make the final decision on whether your child should attend school. Please consult with your healthcare provider for their recommendations if you feel your child is at greater health risk from contracting the COVID-19 virus. </p>

<p>We will continue to seek information and guidance from our local, state, and national officials as we move forward. Please continue to check our district website at <a href="http://www.kimberly.k12.wi.us/updates">www.kimberly.k12.wi.us/updates</a> and your emails regularly for updates going forward.</p>

<p>These decisions have not been made lightly but in the best interest of the safety of our students and staff. We appreciate your support and patience during these unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>Dear KASD Families:</p>

<p>We are actively monitoring the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) status and working with local and state health officials. Each day the status of the virus changes significantly. Currently, the Kimberly Area School District does not have a confirmed case of coronavirus or COVID-19 in our schools; but it is important that our families and staff know that KASD is keeping track of this situation.</p>

<p>Due to the changing status of COVID-19, Governor Evers announced a Public Health Emergency to highlight the potential for the significant spread of the virus.  </p>

<p>We will be reviewing recommendations from State and local health officials daily to determine the impact on our schools and your families. You can find the State recommendations here <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/covid-19.htm">https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/covid-19.htm</a>.</p>

<p>The district is preparing a plan for a potential closing should it be necessary. We will provide you detailed information should we need to close a specific school or district. In the meantime, a survey will be sent to your home to determine internet access and computer access for your child. Please complete the survey upon receipt.</p>

<p>As a parent, you make the final decision on whether your child should attend school. Please consult with your healthcare provider for their recommendations if you feel your child is at greater health risk from contracting the COVID-19 virus. Your school nurse will help you address absences due to staying home for health reasons.</p>

<p>Please join me in taking recommended precautions as we work through this challenging issue. The district has put together a webpage to provide you up to date district status reports and COVID-19 resources at <a href="https://www.kimberly.k12.wi.us/updates">https://www.kimberly.k12.wi.us/updates</a></p>

<p>Dear KASD Families:</p>

<p>Kimberly Area School District values the health and well-being of our students, staff and families. We work<br>
daily to promote safe and healthy schools. This is always our priority.</p>

<p>Our school health services staff continue to work with school administrators to plan and respond to emerging communicable disease concerns, including COVID-19, following the guidance of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).  KASD’s plan for pandemic influenza has been reviewed and our District is prepared to respond with the guidance of our local public health department if needed. </p>

<p>A continued theme from the CDC is that it is currently flu season and getting vaccinated for influenza, taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed is recommended.</p>

<p>Here are some of the CDC recommendations to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
	<li>If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home when you are sick.  If you have flu like symptoms (persistent cough, sore throat, temperature greater than 100.4), contact your health care provider.  You should be fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever reducing medication before returning to school.</li>
	<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
