<a id="learning"></a>Update: April 8, 2020</h2>
<h3>School closure extended through April 29, online education plan begins April 15</h3>
<p>As you know, Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced that school closures have been extended through April 29. Although we are eager to have our students back in school, the safety and best interest of our students is always our first priority. We thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>These past few weeks, remote learning opportunities have focused on academic enrichment and engagement in order for students to maintain skills. Effective Wednesday, April 15, the district will begin implementation of an education plan for K-12 students using online instruction. If alternative means of access to materials is necessary, please reach out to your building administrator(s). The remote learning plan directly correlates to New York State Learning Standards and local grade level expectations.</p>
<p>As we begin online instruction, please note the following changes and important items:</p>
<p>New marking period dates and grading policy</p>
<p>As required by the Governor’s executive order, our faculty will continue to provide enrichment opportunities through April 14, including the period of time originally scheduled as spring break.</p>
<p>During this time, some teachers may allow students to make up assignments they may have missed, resubmit assignments for additional credit, and seek guidance about concepts previously taught. This is an important opportunity for you and your child to make sure any work that was due prior to March 13 is submitted. Flexibility will be provided throughout marking period four to ensure that students have had ample opportunity to bolster marking period three grades.</p>
<p>SAS &amp; GIS</p>
<p>Elementary students began trimester three on March 7. Although the remote learning plan will be implemented on April 15, students have already been in trimester three; therefore, students will have an opportunity to resubmit work, if necessary.</p>
<p>Going forward, all student work will be assessed based on the completion and quality of work. Based on this criteria, we are also modifying the third trimester grading system to Pass/Fail for all students K-12. However, it is important to note this may change, depending on when/if school resumes based on guidance from Gov. Cuomo.</p>
<p>For students in grades K-5, the Pass/Fail measure will be utilized. It is imperative that students access their assignments and projects daily and that they are diligent in completing each task assigned. Assignments will be marked as Complete or Incomplete by the classroom teacher.  Although students will not receive grades, feedback will be provided, where appropriate. The feedback provided will be prompt and meaningful. Teachers will utilize the comments area of the report card to provide a narrative regarding student performance. All factors will be used for determining placements and promotion for the 2020-21 school year.</p>
<p>More details will be provided by your child’s teachers and/or principal.</p>
<p>CJH &amp; GHS</p>
<p>Marking Period 3 officially ended Friday, March 13, which was the last day of school before the extended school closure began. Students may have an opportunity to submit past-due work for Marking Period 3 through Tuesday, April 14. Again, flexibility will be provided throughout marking period four to ensure that students have had ample opportunity to bolster marking period three grades.</p>
<p>Marking Period 4 will begin on Wednesday, April 15. This quarter will include new instructional material. We understand that there may be unique issues with distance learning; therefore, teachers have prioritized the most necessary and critical areas of their curriculum. Teachers will utilize this prioritized curriculum map to provide instruction that will allow students to achieve grade level and content area standards.</p>
<p>Going forward, student work will be assessed based on the completion and quality of work. Based on this criteria, we are also modifying our Fourth Marking Period grading system to Pass/Fail for all students K-12. However, it is important to note this may change, depending on when/if school resumes based on guidance from Gov. Cuomo.</p>
<p>For students in grades 6-12, final averages will be primarily calculated using Marking Periods 1, 2, and 3. Effort and completion of assignments in Marking Period 4 may be taken into consideration for final averages as well, depending on your child’s school. The June 2020 administration of the New York State Regents Examinations has been cancelled for students in grades eight through twelve.  Therefore they will not be a part of the final average calculation.  All factors will be used for determining placements and promotion for the 2020-21 school year.</p>
<p>More details will be provided by your child’s teachers and/or principal.</p>
<p>Student expectations</p>
<p>Students are expected to participate in instruction, complete assignments and communicate regularly with their teachers. Students should assume the seriousness and expectations of distance learning to be equal to what takes place in classrooms. We fully understand that it may not be possible to duplicate the normal classroom environment while utilizing remote learning.</p>
<p>Students are prohibited from taking screenshots or pictures of their teacher or fellow students. In addition, students are also prohibited from taking any audio or video recordings. These behaviors violate our policies and could result in disciplinary action. Students are reminded to follow the Goshen Central School District Code of Conduct and Acceptable Use Policies.</p>
<p>Parents/guardian expectations</p>
<p>It is expected that students will be provided a private setting during online instruction or related services. Recording of teachers or other students is prohibited. Additionally, it’s further understood that no party shall be permitted to record their sessions, and that any such recording will be considered a violation of Board of Education policies. In addition, any incidental and/or unintentional viewing/hearing will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>Depending upon grade level, it’s reasonable to expect weekly instruction time and assignments for all subjects will largely match with what is grade level, course specific and age appropriate. Specific expectations will be communicated by the buildings and/or individual teachers. We encourage our parents and guardians to continue to support your children as they embark on this new and unfamiliar way of learning.</p>
<p>Contact information</p>
<p>Parents must make sure their parent/guardian phone numbers and email addresses are accurate in SchoolTool/Parent Portal. If you need to update this information, please contact your building principal. Any necessary contact information changes will be made as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Technology Support</p>
<p>If you do not have internet access or an electronic device, please contact your child’s principal by telephone or the Central Office at 845-615-6720. Additional information will be provided about technology support via email and will be placed on the district website in the near future.</p>
<p>We encourage our families to continue to check the district website for updates. Our goal is to ensure your child’s academic success during this challenging time. We appreciate your continued patience and flexibility as we await guidance from Gov. Cuomo and the State Education Department. We understand that this may not be a perfect process and we are grateful for everyone’s continued support, understanding and resilience.</p>
<h2>
<a id="ed"></a>Update: April 2, 2020</h2>
<h3>Enrichment activities to continue, online education may occur</h3>
<p>As you are likely aware, on March 27, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order closing schools until at least April 15. During this time, as per the Governor’s executive order, schools are required to provide continuity of instruction, meals for students and childcare resources every weekday, including days originally part of the previously scheduled spring break.</p>
<p>The remote learning assignments of the past few weeks have focused on academic enrichment and engagement in order to maintain skills. Please continue to encourage and require your children to complete the learning tasks assigned to them.</p>
<p>Students will return to school on April 15 unless we are directed by the Governor to further extend school closure. We will continue to monitor all available guidance and directives and keep you informed.</p>
<p>If schools are directed to remain closed beyond April 15, the district will begin to implement an education plan using online instruction.  We will continue to provide students with Chromebooks, as needed. More details regarding the plan will be shared in the coming days.</p>
<p>We recognize that this is a stressful and challenging situation and that our families are shouldering many personal and professional responsibilities. We are here to support you, and will relay information as soon as we receive definitive guidance from State Education.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your continued patience, understanding and support. We are grateful for your resilience and flexibility as we navigate through these unprecedented times.</p>
<h2>
<a id="Budget"></a>Update: March 31, 2020</h2>
<h3>Budget vote, Board elections postponed</h3>
<p>New York state school budget votes and board of education elections will be delayed until at least June 1, 2020, according to an executive order released by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday, March 30, 2020. <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20213-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency?fbclid=IwAR2USDjqjnMNfoFvS3Ks0LNGSU0HRD0t8-ipERVPJRw5tdKD_K3dl0Wpfk4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">View the executive order here.</a></p>
<p>The order specifically says, “Any school board, library board, or village election scheduled to take place in April or May of 2020 is hereby postponed until at least June 1, 2020, and subject to further directive as to the timing, location or manner of voting for such elections.”</p>
<p>This change will also impact school districts’ regular notification practices and timelines for sharing information about the vote and election. We will share more information with the community as it becomes available.</p>
<h2>
<a id="april15"></a>Update: March 27, 2020</h2>
<h3>Governor’s school closure order extended to April 15</h3>
<p>Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced today, March 27, that schools in New York state will remain closed until April 15.</p>
<p>Goshen students and staff were to return to school the day prior on Tuesday, April 14, after the conclusion of spring break; they will now return on Wednesday, April 15, as per the executive order. We are closely monitoring the situation at the state and local level and will let you know if that closure needs to be extended.</p>
<p>Sporting practices and events, rehearsals, shows, school events, activities and after-school programs will also continue to be canceled during this time. We will continue providing meals to families during spring recess. <a href="https://www.gcsny.org/2020/03/29/covid19/#meals">Please view the details of our food distribution plan.</a></p>
<p>Child care for essential workers and first responders is available through the YMCA as well as other daycare providers. <a href="https://www.gcsny.org/2020/03/25/ymca-to-offer-emergency-childcare-for-families-of-first-responders-essential-health-workers/">Please click here for more information about the YMCA Emergency Childcare Program</a>.</p>

<h3>View a message from the Superintendent about schools reopening</h3>
<p>Dear members of the Goshen Schools community,</p>
<p>​​​​​​​Although it’s only the second full week of our district’s extended closure, it certainly feels as though schools have been closed for much longer. At this time, I’d like to address the question I know we are all wondering: When will schools reopen?</p>
<p>The short answer: I simply do not know. At this time, our students are scheduled to return to school on Tuesday, April 14, after the conclusion of spring recess; however, as with all things related to the COVID-19 public health crisis, this can change at any moment. We are waiting for guidance from the Governor, who will ultimately decide when it is safe for all New York state students to return to school. Like you, we are taking things day by day.</p>
<p>I realize there is much speculation and rumors circling this issue, and that can be worrisome and overwhelming for our families and employees. District officials are committed to working with you through these issues and to communicate with our school community as soon as we receive definitive information from the Governor’s office.</p>
<p>Please know this – we miss our students tremendously. We miss our busy hallways, athletic fields and cafeterias. We miss seeing kids running in the playgrounds and waving from their buses. We can’t wait to get back to business as usual, but for now, we ask that our families stay positive and more importantly, stay healthy.</p>
<p>If you should have any questions or concerns, please contact me at daniel.connor@gcsny.org.</p>

<h3>AP Exams to be conducted online</h3>
<p>The College Board, which administers Advanced Placement (AP) exams nationwide, has announced that it will conduct online exams for the 2019-20 school year. The exam content will only cover material taught through early March.</p>
<p>This will ensure that students currently enrolled in an AP course and who pass the course will still receive college credit.</p>
<p>The AP tests will be administered as 45-minute online free-response exams at home. Students will be able to take the streamlined exams on any device they have access to—computer, tablet or smartphone, according to The College Board. Taking a photo of handwritten work will also be an option.</p>
<p>Beginning Wednesday, March 25, <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/coronavirus-updates#free-ap-classes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">students and teachers can attend free, live AP review courses</a>, delivered by AP teachers from across the country. These mobile-friendly classes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be used alongside work that may be given by schools.</li>
<li>Will be recorded and available on-demand so teachers and students can access them any time.</li>
<li>Will focus on reviewing the skills and concepts from the first 75% of the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in need of mobile tools or connectivity <a href="https://collegeboard.tfaforms.net/74" rel="nofollow noreferrer">can contact The College Board.</a></p>

<h3>View a letter from the Superintendent about online learning resources</h3>
<p>Dear Goshen families,</p>
<p>I would like to take a moment to thank you all for your patience and resilience during this challenging time. We are continuing to diligently monitor the COVID-19 situation as it unfolds, and to closely follow the guidance provided from the New York State Education Department, public health departments and government officials. Many questions remain unanswered; however, we will continue to communicate factual information to our community members as soon as it is made available.</p>
<p>Goshen educators have been working diligently to create learning materials and resources for students so that they may practice skills, review content and explore topics during the extended school closure. This will require parent guidance, self-direction and some creative thinking. The goal is to minimize regression and keep students sharp for their return to school.</p>
<p>We recognize that we cannot truly replicate the instruction that happens in our classrooms; therefore, these materials should be viewed as enrichment materials. Please note that all deadlines and due dates have been put on hold until further notice. This will be the standard for all of our schools.</p>
<p>Teachers are working hard to provide these learning opportunities and resources and have purposely selected tools that are frequently used in the classroom. If you have questions, teachers will be checking their emails on a regular basis and will respond to inquiries in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that these procedures are subject to change as we await guidance and clarification from education and government officials. We must all remain flexible as we navigate this ever changing situation.</p>
<p>We will all work together to do our best for our students as we continue to navigate these circumstances day by day. Please enjoy your families, be safe and stay healthy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Daniel T. Connor<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<p>The New York State Board of Regents and state Education Department announced Friday, March 20, that the elementary- and intermediate-level state assessments for Grades 3-8 have been suspended for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p>“It is most important that during the time of closure, schools are able to continue to focus their efforts toward local school and community needs, as they have been doing, and not be concerned about state assessments. NYSED has applied for federal waivers for testing, accountability and reporting requirements,” Board of Regents Chancellor Betty A. Rosa and Interim State Education Commissioner Shannon Tahoe said in a statement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education announced Friday that states may cancel any scheduled standardized tests for this school year.</p>
<p>This suspension applies to the following New York state testing programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>New York State Grades 3-8 English Language Arts Test;</li>
<li>New York State Grades 3-8 Mathematics Test;</li>
<li>New York State Grade 4 Elementary-Level Science Test;</li>
<li>New York State Grade 8 Intermediate-Level Science Test;</li>
<li>New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) in Grades K-12; and</li>
<li>New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) for students with severe cognitive disabilities in Grades 3-8 and high school.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updated information about meal distributions</h3>
<p>In a greater attempt to practice social distancing, breakfast and lunch distributions will be reduced to three days per week for Goshen families, beginning Monday, March 23.

<h3>Goshen Schools closed until April 14, 2020</h3>
<p>Dear Goshen families,</p>
<p>Orange County Executive Steven Neuhaus has made the recommendation to close all school districts in Orange County from March 16 to March 27, 2020, as a precautionary measure to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>Given that this is a rapidly evolving public health issue, district officials have decided to extend this closure for a third week, leading up to Spring Recess. Therefore, students will return to school on Tuesday, April 14, pending further instruction from local government and/or health officials. This includes all athletics, extra-curricular and after-school activities.</p>
<p><strong>Again, the Goshen Central School District is closed beginning Monday, March 16 and will reopen on Tuesday, April 14.</strong></p>
<p>Educators have been working diligently to prepare meaningful, at-home learning activities for students in order to limit any adverse effects on academics during this closure. Many materials have been finalized and distributed to students. Online learning channels such as Google Classroom will be utilized in some instances. Beginning next week, more information will be provided to families regarding the specifics of accessing digital materials.</p>
<p>We are also working to finalize plans to continue providing school meals to students who are part of our free- and reduced-lunch program; these plans will be forthcoming as well.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor this situation very closely and follow the guidance of the County Executive, the Orange County Health Department (OCHD), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), and the New York State Education Department (NYSED).</p>
<p>This is a rapidly evolving situation and we will continue to provide our community with updates as soon as information is available. We understand that emotions are high and are grateful to our students, employees and families for their patience and adaptability during this challenging time.</p>

<p>We wanted to let you know that as a precautionary measure, members of a household connected to our school district are in a voluntary, self-imposed quarantine due to recent travel outside of Orange County. <strong>This household is not confirmed to have COVID-19.</strong></p>
<p>Based on conversations with the Orange County Health Department (OCHD), the family is asymptomatic – meaning they are not exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19. These individuals are complying with all of the recommendations from local health authorities and we appreciate their decision to quarantine themselves – a selfless act taken out of an abundance of caution and consideration to others.</p>
<p>Our partners at the health department have emphasized that the general risk to the public is low and that while we all need to be vigilant and cautious, it is also important to stay calm and not contribute to any undue panic. <strong>At the time this letter was written, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the school district or Orange County.  </strong></p>
<p>As with all matters related to public health, we will follow all guidance from the OCHD, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), and the New York State Education Department (NYSED) in relation to this evolving situation.</p>

<p>Regarding travel and quarantine measures, please know that the New York State Department of Health has made quarantine a mandatory measure for individuals returning to the United States from a known high-risk exposure area.
