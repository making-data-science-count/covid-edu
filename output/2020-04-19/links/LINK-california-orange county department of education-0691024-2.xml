<h2>County Supt. Al Mijares offers words of encouragement to parents, teachers and staff</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/409001524?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>With a month of distance learning in the books, Orange County Superintendent Al Mijares offered some words of encouragement for parents, educators and staff.</p>
<p>In a video message posted on Friday, Mijares acknowledged the herculean efforts of parents who are guiding their children through online lessons while managing child care and holding down their regular jobs. Teachers, he said, are operating under similarly strained conditions, with many taking care of their children at home while navigating new communications tools.</p>
<p>“There are tough times in history when the stakes feel impossibly high,” the superintendent said. “But our country has been through tough times before, and I have full confidence we will find our way through this storm.”</p>

<h2>Tustin Unified announces new dates for graduation ceremonies</h2>
<p>A committee of Tustin Unified School District administrators, ASB advisors, teachers and students from district high schools have recommended rescheduling graduation ceremonies from late May to early August.</p>
<p>Tentatively, graduations will be held on Aug. 4, 5 and 6, with two schools per day, officials said. In an effort to avoid the summer heat, graduations will occur at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Below is the high school graduation schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday, Aug. 4: Tustin Adult School and Tustin Connect (times to be determined)</li>
<li>Wednesday, Aug. 5: Foothill at 10 a.m. and Beckman at 6 p.m.</li>
<li>Thursday, Aug. 6: Hillview at 10 a.m. and Tustin at 6 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beckman, Foothill, Hillview and Tustin graduation ceremonies will be held at Tustin High School’s Northrup Stadium, 1171 El Camino Real. Tustin Adult School and Tustin Connect graduation ceremonies will be held in the Beckman High School Performing Arts Center, 3588 Bryan Ave.</p>
<p>The district’s high school graduation ceremonies will be conducted under the social distancing guidelines in place at that time, officials said. More information will be provided in the weeks ahead as plans are developed. Students and parents were notified of the ceremonies through an all-district email.</p>
<p>“High school seniors and their families are excited about the district planning to hold traditional graduation ceremonies during such an unusual school year,” Franklin said in a district press release.</p>

<h2>State superintendent launches task force aimed at closing digital divide</h2>
<p>A new state Department of Education task force will work to close the digital divide for California students who lack access to resources such as internet connectivity and devices, state Superintendent Tony Thurmond announced Thursday.</p>
<p>“This task force signals a new era, that California is now working with focus and urgency to close the digital divide in the most concrete way we have ever seen,” Thurmond said in a news release. “COVID-19 is a public health crisis in California and all around the world, but it’s also revealed other crises like the technology gap that has persisted for too long, leading to opportunity and achievement gaps for California’s students.”</p>
<p>The Closing the Digital Divide Task Force will help facilitate donations, create more publicity and cast a bigger spotlight on those who can help. It also plans to hold a public hearing where internet service providers may be called upon to testify on their efforts to improve internet access during the pandemic, Thurmond said.</p>
<p>State officials have in recent weeks assessed the technology needs for California students and are working with partners to secure devices and WiFi hotspots to close the technology gap. This effort comes as many school districts across California have announced campuses will remain closed to students through at least the end of the school year.</p>
<p>The state also announced last week that it partnered with the Californians Dedicated to Education Foundation, the non-profit partner of the Department of Education since 2011, to create the California Bridging the Digital Divide Fund. The fund is a joint effort of the Governor’s Office, the state Board of Education and CDE Foundation, and is a centralized resource for state leadership to provide essential devices, connectivity and related digital learning supports for pre-K-12 students, teachers and their families.</p>
<p>The California Bridging the Digital Divide Fund is now accepting individual contributions at <a href="https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/cdef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bit.ly/CADigitalDivide</a>. Corporate and institutional donors may contact Mary Nicely at <a href="mailto:mnicely@cde.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mnicely@cde.ca.gov</a>.</p>

<h2>SAT, ACT to shift to digital, at-home versions if school closures stretch into fall</h2>
<p>High schools students will be able to take an at-home, digital version of the SAT if school closures remain in effect through the fall, the test’s publisher <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-15/college-board-to-offer-sat-at-home-if-coronavirus-closures-continue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>The College Board provided few details of what the home version of the exam would look like, which is currently taken on paper in a secure setting under the watchful eye of proctors. The ACT, the SAT’s counterpart, will also be available digitally at home this fall.</p>
<p>The announcements come as colleges across the country — <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-01/uc-to-suspend-admission-requirements-for-sat-minimum-gpas-to-help-students-during-coronavirus-crisis">including the University of California</a> — are making the SAT and ACT standardized tests optional as an admissions requirement for students entering college in fall 2021.</p>
<p>The College Board has already announced that it will administer Advanced Placement tests at home in May because of the virus. The AP tests will be shortened to 45 minutes from about three hours, and will be open book.</p>
<p>The College Board announced the at-home possibility as an option for students who have not been able to take the SAT this spring, or who have concerns about their ability to take it in the fall.</p>

<h2>OC Health Care Agency launches new website to help residents access mental health services</h2>
<p>To help residents cope with fear, anxiety and stress in the COVID-19 era, the OC Health Care Agency has <a href="https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/mental-health-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched a website with a menu of mental health support services</a> that can be accessed by telephone or online.</p>
<p>You can find it here: <a href="https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/mental-health-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/mental-health-support</a></p>
<p>Along with work and school disruptions, the global pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders have brought on feelings of uncertainty and isolation for many, along with financial worries and concerns about loved ones.</p>
<p>The new site was created by the HCA’s Behavioral Health Services division as a way to easily access an array of local resources. It includes a suicide prevention hotline, contact information for a crisis assessment team, counseling resources and an information and referral line.</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.namioc.org/oc-warmline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the OC WarmLine</a>, which offers confidential telephone support for anyone who might be lonely, confused or in need of information about mental health or substance abuse services.</p>
<p>Additional community resources are included, and extended hours of support are available.</p>

<h2>Governor lists six factors the state will consider before modifying stay-at-home orders</h2>
<p>Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday outlined six key indicators that will drive the process of gradually lifting California’s stay-at-home order.</p>
<p>At his afternoon news conference, Newsom noted that social distancing and other COVID-19 interventions have yielded positive results to <a href="https://vimeo.com/398108492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bend the curve</a>, which is critical to keeping the state’s health care systems from being overrun. However, he and other state officials acknowledged these measures are not sustainable long-term and have already impacted California’s economy, poverty levels and overall health.</p>
<p>“While Californians have stepped up in a big way to flatten the curve and buy us time to prepare to fight the virus, at some point in the future we will need to modify our stay-at-home order,” the governor said. “As we contemplate reopening parts of our state, we must be guided by science and data, and we must understand that things will look different than before.”</p>
<p>Lifting the stay-at-home order will be a gradual process, he said, taking into account these <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">six indicators:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to monitor and protect communities through testing, contact tracing, isolating and supporting those who are positive or exposed</li>
<li>The ability to prevent infection in people who are at risk for more severe COVID-19</li>
<li>The ability of the hospital and health systems to handle surges</li>
<li>The ability to develop therapeutics to meet the demand</li>
<li>The ability for businesses, schools and child care facilities to support physical distancing</li>
<li>The ability to determine when to reinstitute certain measures, such as the stay-at-home orders, if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Newsom said there is no precise timeline for restarting public life and businesses but said these six indicators will serve as the basis for making critical decisions. He suggested that a clearer picture could be offered in two weeks if the state continues to see a decline in hospitalization rates and ICU occupancies.</p>
<p>California could look somewhat different as it transitions to a post-COVID-19 society. For example, he said, schools could stagger their schedules so that larger populations do not congregate at once, and restaurants could have fewer tables.</p>
<p>“There’s no light switch here,” Newsom said. “I would argue it’s more like a dimmer.”</p>

<h2>Governor says west coast states are developing a framework for reopening economies</h2>
<p>California, Oregon and Washington are collaborating on a regional plan to reopen west coast economies in a “safe and strategic and responsible way,” Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday.</p>
<p>Details about California’s specific approach will be announced on Tuesday, Newsom said. But the governor said the three states have developed a framework for restarting public life and business based on shared objectives.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to overstate this framework,” he said during an afternoon news conference, “and I don’t want to understate the imperative of meeting this moment by continuing to practice appropriate social distancing and practicing physical distancing so we can continue to bend the curve.”</p>
<p>On Monday, Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee joined Newsom in a joint statement declaring that their states were “acting in close coordination and collaboration to ensure the virus can never spread wildly in our communities.”</p>
<p>The shared approach, they said, will put forth clear indicators for reopening the economy, noting that “health outcomes and science” —  rather than politics — will guide decisions.</p>
<p>“We’ll be driven by facts, we’ll be driven by evidence, we’ll be driven by science, we’ll be driven by our public health advisors,” Gov. Newsom said. “And we’ll be driven by the collaborative spirit that defines the best of us at this incredibly important moment.”</p>
<p>Other developments:</p>

<li>School districts throughout Orange County have been <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/these-oc-districts-are-offering-grab-and-go-meals-at-a-campus-near-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">setting up grab-and-go sites</a> to make sure students continue to have access to healthy meals during the COVID-19 crisis. But in many cases, students aren’t the only ones in need of food. Saddleback Church is among the organizations that <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/saddleback-church-teams-up-with-ocde-to-provide-meals-groceries-for-oc-families/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are stepping in to fill that gap</a>. Since March 9, the church has been working with OCDE’s Alternative Education division to provide groceries to almost 2,000 families a week.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One month ago today, school district leaders in Orange County announced the decision to temporarily close all campuses to students to slow the spread of COVID-19. The OCDE Newsroom has <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/a-month-after-school-closures-began-educators-students-and-families-learning-to-adjust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put together this timeline of what’s happened since</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>County health officials <a href="https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/coronavirus-in-oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported nine new cases of COVID-19</a> on Monday, marking the lowest daily count since March 17. By comparison, there were 55 new cases documented on Sunday and 85 the day before that. To date, there have been 1,283 total cases countywide, resulting in 19 fatalities, according to the OC Health Care Agency’s website. More than 14,000 individuals have been tested tested by the HCA Public Health Lab and commercial labs.</li>

<h2>OC probation staff member assigned to juvenile facility has tested positive for COVID-19</h2>

<h2>OC health officer says workers at essential businesses should wear face coverings</h2>
<p>Orange County’s top health official is strongly encouraging all employees of essential businesses to wear face coverings at work, and all residents engaged in essential activities outside the home are urged to do the same.</p>
<p>The recommendation by County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick is in line with guidance from the California Department of Public Health. The objective is to help slow the spread of COVID-19 by those who are not showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Essential workers, <a href="https://www.covid19.ca.gov/img/EssentialCriticalInfrastructureWorkers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as identified by the state of California</a>, include those supporting schools, colleges and universities to enable distance learning and offer school meals. They also include those who <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/theres-a-website-to-help-essential-workers-find-open-childcare-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supervise the children of employees in critical sectors</a>.</p>
<p>“Residents can make their own face coverings at home from a variety of materials and should refrain from purchasing personal protective equipment that is critical and in short supply for our healthcare workers, such as N95 and surgical masks,” Dr. Quick said.</p>
<p>Face coverings use common materials to cover the nose and mouth. They can be secured to the head with ties or straps, or simply wrapped around the lower face. Face coverings may be factory-made, as well as folded or sewn, and can be improvised using household items like scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts or towels.</p>
<p>“Face coverings are an additional tool that may help protect staff and patrons from COVID-19, but they are not a substitute for proven protective measures like frequent hand washing, keeping your hands away from your face, practicing social distancing and staying home,” said Dr. Quick.</p>
<p>All essential businesses should continue to ensure healthy work environments based on recommendations from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>

<h2>Number of COVID-19 cases in Orange County surpasses 1,000</h2>
<p>Orange County has hit a sobering COVID-19 milestone, surpassing 1,000 cases.</p>
<p>The cumulative total now stands at 1,016, with 91 new cases added Wednesday. To date, there have been 17 deaths.</p>
<p>The first local case of COVID-19 was reported back on Jan. 25, and nearly 11,800 individuals have been tested in Orange County. Of that group, about 8.6 percent have been diagnosed with the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>In an effort to <a href="https://vimeo.com/398108492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flatten the curve</a>, the governor and the state Department of Public Health have ordered Californians to shelter in place, with exceptions for essential workers and those participating in critical activities, such as grocery shopping or picking up prescriptions.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 3, the OC Health Care website <a href="https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ochealthinfo.com/novelcoronavirus</a> began including a hospitalization chart showing cases over time.</p>
<p>“While we want to provide information that best educates our community during this pandemic, it’s important to understand that hospitalization numbers capture a point in time and will fluctuate daily,” said County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick. “Looking at historical data over a period of weeks can give us a better understanding of trends in our community.”</p>

<h2>Governor expresses optimism, introduces playbooks for managing stress</h2>
<p>During a news conference on Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom sought to convey a sense of optimism, saying the social distancing efforts of Californians were slowing the spread of the coronavirus and flattening the curve.</p>
<p>“It is bending, but it’s also stretching,” the governor said.</p>
<p>Newsom said 15,865 individuals have tested positive for COVID-19 in California, representing a 10.7 percent increase over Monday’s rate. The hospitalization rate was up to 2,611, a 4.1 percent increase in 24 hours, and 1,108 patients were in intensive care units, marking a 2.1 percent increase.</p>
<p>“Our modeling shows that we’re not at peak in a week or two, that we are seeing a slow and steady increase,” he said. “But it’s moderate, and it’s moderate, again, because of the actions all of you have taken in terms of the physical distancing.”</p>
<p>Newsom started his press conference by addressing mental health concerns and the secondary physical impacts of sheltering in place. State Surgeon General Dr. Nadine Burke Harris <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/manage-stress-for-health/#top" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has developed new playbooks for managing stress</a> for children and adults, he said.</p>

<h2>In OC, children account for less than 1 percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases</h2>
<p>Local health officials announced 51 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, bringing Orange County’s total to 882, including 14 deaths.</p>
<p>To date, the OC Health Care Agency’s website is reporting just six confirmed cases of children ages 0 to 17 infected by the novel coronavirus, with no fatalities. That amounts to about 0.7 percent of all cases in the county.</p>
<p>By comparison, 41 percent of local COVID-19 cases are ages 45 to 64, 16 percent are between 25 and 34, and 15 percent are in the 35 to 44 age group, according to <a href="https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/coronavirus-in-oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the HCA’s website</a>. The age ranges, though unequal, are intended to group those with a generally similar health risk.</p>
<p>In California, 160 of the 13,438 COVID-19 cases are in the 0-17 age group, for a rate of about 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>“It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs,” <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> says on its website. “There is more to learn about how the disease impacts children.”</p>
<p>Public schools in Orange County have not had students on their campuses since March 13, when district superintendents and school boards made the decision to temporarily suspend in-person attendance. Many districts have moved to <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/ocde-curates-distance-learning-resources-for-educators-counselors-and-families/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distance learning models</a> for the remainder of the school year.</p>

<h2>OC residents encouraged to create family pandemic plans</h2>
<p>We’re often reminded to plan for emergencies like earthquakes and fires, but officials say planning before and during a pandemic is just as critical.</p>
<p>That’s why the county is encouraging local residents to create family preparedness plans in case they’re impacted by COVID-19.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="alignright wp-image-18836" src="https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1.jpg?resize=401%2C567&amp;ssl=1" alt="Graphic encouraging residents to create a family plan" width="401" height="567" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1.jpg?w=1448&amp;ssl=1 1448w, https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1.jpg?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w, https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1.jpg?resize=724%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 724w, https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1086&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1.jpg?resize=1086%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1086w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>So what does a pandemic plan look like? For starters, parents and caregivers should identify trusted family members, friends or neighbors who may be able to take care of children if the parent or caregiver is diagnosed with COVID-19 and requires hospitalization or isolation.</p>
<p>“We want families to be ready in the event a caregiver unexpectedly is diagnosed with COVID-19,” said Debra Baetz, director of Orange County Social Services Agency. “By taking some simple steps, families can help alleviate the stress of an unforeseen health emergency and ensure their loved ones are cared for.”</p>
<p>Here are some important things to consider when putting together a family plan:</p>
<p><strong>Create an alternate caregiver list.</strong> Set up a roster of trusted adults who can step in to provide childcare, being mindful of the unique circumstances surrounding COVID-19. Choose individuals who are not high-risk and who would be able to accommodate an isolation area, should your child need it. Discuss the plan ahead of time with these individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare documents.</strong> Write a letter authorizing your designated caregiver to seek medical treatment for your child, if necessary. Make copies of insurance cards and other important medical documents your alternate caregiver may need.</p>
<p><strong>Write down special instructions.</strong> Be sure to leave a “need-to-know” list for your alternate caregiver. This list may include information such as food allergies, needed medication, nutritional needs or limitations, or any other habits or routines that may help provide consistency of care to your loved one.</p>
<p><strong>Create a kid-friendly “go bag.”</strong> Being separated from a parent or loved one can cause stress and anxiety for children. Pack a bag with some overnight essentials and include a special note from you, a family photo, a favorite book or other personal item that may help comfort your child. Be sure to also pack essentials including toiletries and clothing.</p>

<h2>Health officials issue new guidance on wearing face coverings in public</h2>
<p>State and county health officials have <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-040.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued new guidance on the use of cloth face coverings</a> for those who must leave their homes for essential activities, saying they could reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not have symptoms while reinforcing physical distancing.</p>
<p>The guidance does not require people to wear face coverings, and they shouldn’t be a substitute for far more effective practices like social distancing and hand washing. The California Department of Public Health also does not recommend that Californians wear N-95 masks or surgical masks, which are needed for health care workers and first responders.</p>
<p>“Wearing a cloth face covering when leaving the house for essential activities may help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by residents who are positive but don’t have any symptoms,” said Orange County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick. “However, it’s important for community members to remember that face coverings are not a replacement for prevention measures like social distancing and frequent hand washing, which continue to be the best way to protect yourself.”</p>
<p>Experts say the best defense against COVID-19 is s<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">taying at home and physical distancing; w</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">ashing hands frequently; a</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">voiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; a</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">voiding being around sick people; and st</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">aying home if you’re sick.</span></p>
<p>The state Department of Public Health defines face coverings as cotton, silk or linen used to cover the mouth and nose. Coverings can be homemade or improvised from everyday items such as scarfs, bandanas, T-shirts, sweatshirts or towels.

<h2>State superintendent announces new guidance on grading and grad requirements for seniors</h2>
<p>California education officials have issued <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/gradegraduationfaq.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new guidance on graduation requirements and grading for high school seniors</a>.</p>
<p>Announced late Wednesday by state schools chief Tony Thurmond, the guidance was drafted in collaboration with local districts and higher education institutions.</p>
<p>“We are thinking of our seniors and the impact that the current COVID-19 public health emergency and subsequent physical closure of schools has had on them, and we hope that this guidance will help relieve some stress and anxiety,” Thurmond said. “We are doing everything we can to support all our schools and students, and will continue to address seniors’ needs going forward.”</p>
<p>The California Department of Education has been working with the UC, CSU and community college systems, as well as with private and non-profit universities, on solutions to a number of admissions challenges.</p>
<p>The new guidance covers A-G requirements and provides information relevant to seniors and juniors, addressing such questions as “If an LEA switches to a ‘credit’ or ‘pass’ instead of a letter grade, how will that impact a student’s admission to UC or CSU?”</p>
<p>You can find answers to that and more here: <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/gradegraduationfaq.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/gradegraduationfaq.asp</a></p>
<p>“All seniors who are on track for graduation should be able to graduate,” State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond said in a statement. “This new guidance further illustrates how students can and should be held harmless in grading, and how their work can be acknowledged.”</p>

<p>OC districts temporarily dismissed students on March 13 in response to COVID-19 fears and calls for social distancing. Many initially announced campus closures of two to three weeks but have since extended those timelines based on guidance from state and local health officials.</p>
<p>“This has placed our schools in a holding pattern, and it has been difficult for families to make long-term plans,” Mijares said. “Now, as we enter a new phase in our understanding of the threat, it is time to address the reality that our efforts to <a href="https://vimeo.com/398108492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flatten the curve</a> and keep students safe cannot be accomplished in the span of a few weeks or even a month.”</p>
<p>The superintendent said educators and families have already found innovative ways to communicate and build lessons that support academic continuity, but more must be done to ensure equity, access, support and high-quality learning.</p>
<p>“Fatigued though we may be, the time has come to take a quantum leap by creating online systems that build knowledge and skills, allow for student work to be submitted and graded, support equity and socio-emotional learning, and encourage vigorous interaction between young learners and their teachers,” he said.</p>
<p>The superintendent’s statement, which can be <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/county-superintendent-addresses-student-dismissals-distance-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read here in its entirety</a>, followed a press conference featuring California Governor Gavin Newsom and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond.

<h2>State superintendent says schools, districts should plan on student dismissals extending to summer</h2>
<p>Echoing comments from the governor, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said Tuesday that campuses will likely not reopen to students before summer break.</p>

<p>“Due to the current safety concerns and needs for ongoing social distancing, it currently appears that our students will not be able to return to school campuses before the end of the school year,” Thurmond said in a statement.</p>
<p>The superintendent stressed that this does not mean school is over for the year. Instead, he said districts should put their efforts into strengthening their <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/distancelearning.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distance learning models</a>, adding that the state is supporting this work.</p>
<p>Additional guidance will be released this week to address grading and graduation requirements for high school juniors and seniors, Thurmond said. Meanwhile, a survey sent to districts will help state officials identify technology gaps.</p>
<p>A media briefing is scheduled for Wednesday, April 1.</p>
<p>The state’s schools chief said the California Department of Education is working to “ensure that all students have access to devices and internet if they need it for their distance learning requirements.”</p>
<p>“We are in unprecedented times,” he said, “and it’s hard to tell what the future holds as we are all doing our best to flatten the curve. From what we know right now, our schools will be closed longer than we originally thought, and it will be best if our schools are prepared for that extension, by having their distance learning models prepared to go until the end of the school year.”</p>

<h2>State and national social distancing orders remain in effect</h2>
<p>Orange County’s public health order to suspend non-essential public and private gatherings was originally set to expire on March 31. But county health officials issued a reminder on Monday that <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Governor Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order</a> remains in effect — and supersedes any local guidance.</p>
<p>On March 19, Gov. Newsom and the California Department of Public Health ordered all individuals to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job. The state order, which is open-ended, also called for social distancing by maintaining at least 6 feet of space between individuals.</p>
<p>As of Monday, local health officials had documented 464 COVID-19 cases in Orange County, resulting in four deaths.</p>

<ul>
<li>Over the weekend, President Trump said he would <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-april-30-extend-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extend social distancing measures until April 30</a>, a departure from previous statements in favor of an earlier date. “The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end,” Trump said during a briefing.</li>

<li>With school districts across Orange County pivoting to distance learning models in real time, OCDE’s Educational Services division <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/ocde-curates-distance-learning-resources-for-educators-counselors-and-families/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has developed a cache of online resources</a> for educators, counselors and families.

The flexibility, designed to support social distancing practices, would apply to local grab-and-go programs that receive federal funding. Under the terms of the waiver, districts should have a process in place to ensure that meals are distributed only to parents or guardians of eligible children, and that duplicate meals are not distributed to any child.</li>
</ul>

<h2>OC Health Care Agency posts city-by-city count of COVID-19 cases</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County health officials began posting COVID-19 cases by city on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/novelcoronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the OC Health Care Agency’s website</a></span> Friday<span style="font-weight: 400;">. The counts will be updated every afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-18677" src="https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-27-at-2.22.06-PM.png?resize=335%2C208&amp;ssl=1" alt="County health officials at a news conference " width="335" height="208" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-27-at-2.22.06-PM.png?w=806&amp;ssl=1 806w, https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-27-at-2.22.06-PM.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-27-at-2.22.06-PM.png?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-27-at-2.22.06-PM.png?resize=400%2C250&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" data-recalc-dims="1"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an afternoon news conference, health officials noted that the statistics correlate with the homes of those who contracted the virus, not necessarily where transmission occurred. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, case counts don’t offer a complete look at transmission rates because testing is prioritized for those at the greatest risk or who are most sick. Asymptomatic residents and those with mild symptoms are typically not tested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick said the risk should be assessed countywide, which means it’s important for all residents to practice social-distancing regardless of the case count in a given city. Doing so will help reduce the spread of infection, ease the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems, and protect those most vulnerable, officials said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect patient confidentiality, the number of cases in cities with a population of 25,000 and under will be combined and listed as a category labeled “Other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Friday, there were 321 documented cases of COVID-19 in Orange County, resulting in three fatalities. It’s not known how many people have recovered from the virus because there aren’t follow-up tests.</span></p>
<p>Other developments from Friday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Along with using the Defense Production Act to order General Motors to produce ventilators for hospitals, President Trump <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-03-27/house-to-hold-voice-vote-on-coronavirus-rescue-package-sending-to-trumps-desk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed the largest economic stimulus package in American history</a>. The $2 trillion measure, which had passed through both houses of Congress, will send payments of $1,200 to millions of Americans and expand aid to those who are out of work. It will also provide $100 billion in COVID-19 funding to hospitals, make $377 billion in federally guaranteed loans available to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program to help struggling companies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also Friday, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond said California has received preliminary federal approval to waive state testing requirements for the 2019-20 school year. California requested approval from the U.S. Department of Education on March 26.</li>

<h2>Increased COVID-19 testing leads to higher OC count; hotline available for those with anxiety</h2>
<p>More testing means more confirmed cases.</p>
<p>That’s been a consistent message from the OC Health Care Agency, which on Thursday reported that the total number of COVID-19 cases in Orange County had climbed to 256. The latest count is up 69 from Wednesday, and it’s based on 3,605 tests.</p>

It is our responsibility to help protect the community and work together to flatten the curve in order to slow the spread of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Those experiencing mild symptoms — and who don’t otherwise need medical care — do not require testing for COVID-19, the agency said. In those cases, individuals should recuperate at home just as they would with a mild illness.</p>

<h2>Orange County reports first death from COVID-19</h2>
<p>County health officials on Tuesday confirmed the first Orange County death attributed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The patient was identified as a man in his 70s with underlying health conditions. He was receiving treatment at a local hospital, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency.</p>
<p>“We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the patient’s family and friends,” County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick said. “This serves as a very unfortunate reminder to the community about the importance of staying at home and social distancing when leaving the household for essential activities, or to work at an essential business, in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 and help protect our most vulnerable neighbors.”</p>
<p>Additional details about the man’s death, including the name of the hospital he was at and his city of residence, will not be disclosed, the agency said.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday evening, there were 152 known cases of COVID-19 in Orange County. Of those, 45 were considered “community acquired,” meaning they were not travel-related or connected to another known case.</p>

<p>“Keeping children home from school is a drastic measure, one that shows how seriously health officials and educators are taking this public health threat,” Mijares said in a statement. “I have always believed our public schools should be lighthouses in the community, and that students learn best when they are working directly with their teachers and engaging with their peers. … At this time, however, it is impossible to foresee when this crisis will be over.”</p>
<p>Even though campuses throughout the state have temporarily dismissed students, the superintendent said educators are working to provide healthy meals and academic continuity for students.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is we are ‘doing school’ differently right now by pivoting to distance learning in real time,” Mijares said. “This requires innovation, creativity and collaboration on an unprecedented scale to ensure that the best practices of one district can flourish in another, if feasible.”</p>

<h2>‘We need to do more’: Governor orders Californians to stay home</h2>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Triggering the nation’s tightest restrictions to halt the spread of COVID-19, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered nearly all Californians to shelter in place at home.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/img/N-33-20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive order</a> impacting nearly 40 million state residents will remain in place until further notice.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-18462" src="https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-8.18.47-PM.png?resize=307%2C222&amp;ssl=1" alt="Gavin Newsom" width="307" height="222" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-8.18.47-PM.png?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w, https://i1.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-8.18.47-PM.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" data-recalc-dims="1">“It’s time for all of us to recognize, as individuals and as a community, we need to do more to meet this moment,” Newsom said during an evening news conference.</p>
<p>Californians will still be allowed to obtain essential needs, meaning a number of businesses will be permitted to remain open. They include gas stations, pharmacies, markets, grocery stores, take-out and delivery restaurants, banks and laundry services.</p>
<p>In a message to educational leaders on Thursday night, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said the governor’s order does not change or impact the role of schools, specifically their duty to provide meals and learning continuity for students during extended dismissals.</p>
<p>Critical infrastructure sectors will also remain open, as will essential state and local government facilities including police stations and offices that provide government programs and services.</p>

<h2>County Superintendent Mijares outlines distance learning efforts at OC forum</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuQvTHVT4Cc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>Local campuses have dismissed students based on current social distancing guidelines, but that doesn’t mean schools are closed.</p>
<p>Speaking Thursday during a livestreamed forum on COVID-19 and its countywide impacts, Orange County Superintendent Al Mijares said schools and districts are pivoting to distance learning models in real time to maintain academic continuity for students.</p>
<p>“We have the capacity to provide online learning,” Mijares said. “It’s becoming more robust as we speak.”</p>
<p>In addition to working with platforms like Canvas, which facilitates digital learning, the Orange County Department of Education has connected with PBS SoCal, which is <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/pbs-socal-offering-broadcast-online-educational-programing-for-students-amid-school-closures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broadcasting standards-based educational content</a>, he said.</p>
<p>The idea is to support districts throughout the county as they finalize their own distance learning plans based on their local needs.</p>
<p>“Kids have devices so this is not a foreign idea to them,” Mijares said.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-18426" src="https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlMijaresOCforum-1.jpg?resize=363%2C272&amp;ssl=1" alt="Don Wagner and Al Mijares" width="363" height="272" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlMijaresOCforum-1.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlMijaresOCforum-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlMijaresOCforum-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlMijaresOCforum-1.jpg?resize=80%2C60&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" data-recalc-dims="1">The county superintendent was paired with Orange County Supervisor Don Wagner during the second of three segments of “Coronavirus: The OC Response,” which was presented by <a href="https://www.ocforum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC Forum</a> with support from UCI. The session kicked off with UCI experts discussing epidemiology, public health and social distancing.</p>
<p>Mijares acknowledged that keeping students home represents a drastic measure, one that signals how seriously school officials are taking the coronavirus threat.</p>
<p>“We are here to serve students, and they need to be in school,” he said. “They need to be working with a teacher. They need to be engaging with their peers, and parents need that type of support. It’s a 24/7 responsibility that we all have.”</p>
<p>Asked when schools might open, he said the situation remained fluid. OCDE and local school districts continue to follow the guidance of the Orange County Health Care Agency. Some district leaders have indicated they will extend their student dismissals.</p>
<p>“It’s really almost a day-by-day basis,” Mijares said. “It’s hard to predict what’s going to happen next.”</p>
<p>The first segment featured Bernadette Boden-Albala, UCI’s dean of Public Health; Dr. Steve Goldstein, UCI’s vice chancellor of Health Affairs, and Dr. Susan Huang, UCI’s medical director of Epidemiology and Infection Prevention.</p>
<p>The event concluded with Orange County Business Council CEO Lucy Dunn, Orange County United Way CEO Susan Parks and Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County CEO Harald Herrmann.</p>

<h2>Governor suspends standardized tests for K-12 students</h2>
<p>Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.17.18-N-30-20-Schools.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued an executive order on Wednesday</a> to waive this year’s statewide assessments for K-12 students.</p>
<p>The order, which is pending federal approval, would apply to more than 6 million students in California.</p>
<p>“This time is stressful enough for students, families and educators without the additional burden of annual testing,” Newsom said. “This is an unprecedented time, and our main focus is on supporting the mental and socio-emotional health of students, while continuing to provide educational opportunities such as distance learning.”</p>
<p>State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond supported the cancellation.</p>
<p>“Our districts need some relief and this decision is in the best interest of our students and our state,” Thurmond said.</p>

<h2>State education leaders issue new guidance for schools, districts</h2>
<p>The California Department of Education <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/guidance.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced new COVID-19 guidance</a> for K-12 schools on Tuesday, covering <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/distancelearning.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distance learning</a> and <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/schoolmeals.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">student meals</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/languageexchangeinc.com/wp-content/uploads/logo-CDE.png?resize=183%2C183&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image of CDE logo" width="183" height="183" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Similarly, the state’s Health and Human Services Agency shared considerations for child care and supervision.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that we exhaust all efforts to minimize the disruptive impact a school closure can have on our students and their families,” State Superintendent Tony Thurmond said.</p>
<p>Developed by state educational leaders in collaboration with the governor’s office, the resources are intended to address some of the more pressing concerns of teachers, administrators and parents in the wake of school closures.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<h3>Distance learning</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Districts should use a combination of technology and non-technology based activities. Additionally, students can work semi-independently, while teachers are available for “office hours” and student check-ins.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Districts must consider equity and access for students who may not have necessary technology when developing distance learning programs. Districts are encouraged to work with their local internet service providers and community groups to help ensure families receive free or affordable internet access during this time of crisis. Districts can also make available to students devices such as Chromebooks so they can connect with teachers.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Schools can also make available paper workbooks for families to pick from schools if online learning is not the most convenient option. For these students, teachers can schedule in-person meetings with individual students as long as they follow <a title="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC health guidelines</a>, including social distancing procedures.</li>

</ul>
<h3>School meals</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Districts should continue offering nutritious lunch and breakfast options, especially for those children ages 18 and younger who rely on free or reduced-priced meals during traditional school hours.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Meal distribution sites should be located in areas that are easily accessible to children eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Schools do not need to distribute meals on a school site and can distribute them at another site convenient to the community such as, but not limited to, local food banks, resource centers, Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, community centers and libraries.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>No meal applications or fees should be collected from children or families. But currently, children must be present to receive meals.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3><b>Child care and supervision</b></h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Districts receiving funding for child care programs should, to the extent practicable, arrange for supervision for students during ordinary school hours.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Districts should coordinate with the local Health Care Agency to ensure these programs remain safe for students and staff.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Districts should collaborate with community partners and other local and state government agencies to provide “pop-up” child care centers for emergency responders and other workers in jobs deemed essential during a time of crisis.</li>

<p>“Child care, educational options, meal service, and providing support to our students with disabilities are all issues that our school communities are grappling with right now,” Thurmond said in a statement. “I am pleased that the governor provided the necessary answers and solutions that our LEAs (local education agencies) need to move forward as they continue to support and serve students throughout the state.”</p>

<h2>County health officer calls for suspension of nonessential gatherings; governor says schools could remain closed into summer</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=114363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a new ban on public and private gatherings</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday, calling for a suspension of all social, professional and community activities that are considered nonessential.</span></p>
<p>Quick clarified that the order is not a countywide shelter-in-place, adding that businesses should stay open and follow social distancing guidelines consistent with the governor’s guidance.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, Governor Gavin Newsom said he anticipated few schools, if any, would reopen before summer break. Though he didn’t elaborate during his afternoon news conference, it marked the first time a state official has issued a statement suggesting California schools may be closed into the summer over COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p>The order for Orange County, which could be revised or extended in the future, is effective immediately and continues through March 31.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Educational services — including K-12 schools, colleges and universities — were characterized as essential for the purpose of facilitating distance learning and performing other critical operations. Health care operations, grocery stores, banks, gas stations and news outlets were also on the list of institutions considered necessary for society to function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child care centers that enable employees to perform essential job duties were exempt in the order. But, to the extent possible, Quick said child care must be carried out in stable groups and in separate rooms if there are multiple groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order goes on to say all bars and establishments that don’t serve food must close, which is consistent with guidance from the California Department of Public Health, and restaurants must suspend on-site dining in favor of takeout, delivery or drive-through options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick says all businesses that are up and running must practice social distancing, raise sanitation standards and make every effort to use telecommuting.</span></p>

<h2>VIDEO: A quick look at how social distancing helps ‘flatten the curve’</h2>

<p>We’ve heard a lot about social distancing lately, and you might have also heard the term “flattening the curve.” The two concepts are connected.</p>
<p>The idea is that minimizing social contact can effectively slow the spread of a virus so you don’t get a huge wave of illnesses all at once. If that were to happen, a community might not have enough hospital beds or staff to manage patient care.</p>
<p>As explained <a href="https://vimeo.com/398108492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in our brief video</a>, infectious disease experts say it helps to spread cases out over weeks or months so that health care systems can keep pace.</p>

<h2>OCDE offices will temporarily close to the public; staff given the option of staying home</h2>
<p>Citing the need for “extraordinary measures” to halt the spread of COVID-19, Orange County Superintendent Al Mijares announced Monday that OCDE’s offices will temporarily close to the public on March 17 and most employees will have the option of staying home through March 27.</p>
<p>“Suffice to say, these are extraordinary times,” Mijares said. “While OCDE has emergency plans and protocols in place, we are dealing with a public health crisis that is rising to a level not previously seen in our lifetimes.”</p>

<p>The Orange County Department of Education serves some of the county’s most vulnerable student populations, including incarcerated students, foster youth and students with significant disabilities. OCDE also provides critical services to local school districts, including payroll operations, training, high-speed internet access and technology support.</p>
<p>Mijares noted that social distancing measures have proven effective during pandemics, slowing the spread of viruses so there’s not a huge wave of illnesses at once.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the patience and professionalism you have exhibited these past weeks as leadership has worked to support Orange County students,” Mijares told employees. “Now our national priority must be to slow the exponential spread of this virus, and I believe it is our patriotic duty to do our part.”</p>
<p>Here’s Dr. Mijares’ memo to staff:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Over the weekend, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued new recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19, outlining sweeping changes to our work and personal lives. Specifically, the governor urged people 65 and older — and those in high-risk categories — to shelter in place at home. He also called for bars, nightclubs, wineries and brewpubs to temporarily shut down and said restaurants should reduce their occupancy levels by half. Similarly, President Donald Trump has instructed Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Distinguishing between essential and nonessential services, Governor Newsom stressed the need to provide meals for children who have been dismissed from school and continuity for students with special needs. More detailed guidance for California’s schools is expected to be released on Tuesday, March 17.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Suffice to say, these are extraordinary times. While OCDE has emergency plans and protocols in place, we are dealing with a public health crisis that is rising to a level not previously seen in our lifetimes. As a result, the time has come to take extraordinary measures to protect our employees and communities while maintaining support for our students. Effective March 17, 2020, the Orange County Department of Education will take the following actions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em>OCDE employees will have the option to stay at home through Friday, March 27 and will remain on paid status unless circumstances change or needs arise.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The actions above may seem unprecedented, but social distancing measures have proven effective in prior pandemics.

<h2>OC schools to close amid COVID-19 concerns; county superintendent issues statement supporting closures</h2>

<li><a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/how-would-it-work-if-oc-needed-to-close-a-school/">Q&amp;A: How does a school closure work?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In an effort to help slow the spread of COVID-19, and amid heightened public concern, school districts across Orange County told their communities on Friday that they would shutter campuses for a minimum of two weeks.</p>
<p>They join scores of school systems throughout California that will temporarily dismiss students starting Monday, March 16, including districts in Los Angeles and San Diego counties. In many instances, the time off will coincide with spring breaks.</p>
<p>After consulting with school district leaders and county health officials earlier in the day, Orange County Superintendent Dr. Al Mijares announced his support for the suspension of school operations for at least 14 days.</p>
<p>“This is not a decision we take lightly,” Dr. Mijares said. “We know that temporarily closing a school has a tremendous impact on our families, and steps will need to be implemented to support the continuity of learning and to ensure students have access to healthy meals. But the safety of our students and staff remains our top priority, and we have confidence that this is the proper precautionary course for Orange County.”</p>
<p>Social distance measures have proven effective in prior pandemics, experts say. The idea is to protect those most vulnerable to illness and to limit the number of cases before a vaccine or treatment becomes available, ensuring health care systems and health workers aren’t overwhelmed.</p>

<p>In anticipation of potential closures, OCDE has been <a href="https://ocde.instructure.com/courses/224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ramping up production of content and materials</a> to support learning at home. The department will also support districts in their efforts to seek funding relief and recover lost instructional time.</p>
<p><strong>Districts finalizing plans</strong></p>
<p>As of Friday evening, Orange County <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had 13 COVID-19 cases that were either confirmed or presumptive</a>. There was one case of community transmission, meaning it was not travel-related or tied to a known case, according to the OC Health Care Agency’s website.</p>
<p>“I want to reassure our Orange County community that the risk of transmission remains low, and that there are no known cases of COVID-19 infection in a student or teacher at this time,” County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick said Friday. “That said, I understand the concerns parents are experiencing and support the school district’s decision to close temporarily. It’s important to note that as both public and private testing capabilities continue to expand, we expect to see more cases.”</p>
<p>Most of Orange County’s school districts have already finalized plans to close campuses to students for two to four weeks. A few were waiting for their school boards to approve closure plans. No district in the county has indicated it plans to remain open.</p>
<p>Many districts have attached an extra week or two to upcoming spring breaks. Districts including Anaheim Elementary, Brea Olinda Unified, Laguna Beach Unified and Huntington Beach City plan to offer some distance learning options for students. Others are encouraging students to read or engage in other academic activities during their time off.</p>

<p>Also Friday, Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/j2X/7rm2Ky/12Kgtmyuzjanmc/s5q415sbv3go7/nq2Kl/o712Kqv/fh7g/psa0tn7qpwn?_c=d%7Cze7pzanwmhlzgt%7C17bt7usd7ag0nfc&amp;_ce=1584144547.35508f397020c61504341b778ed96a0d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued an executive order</a> ensuring California public school still get funding even in the event of a closure. The order directs school districts to use state dollars to fund distance learning and high quality educational opportunities, provide school meals and, as practicable, arrange for the supervision for students during school hours.</p>
<p>District officials in Orange County said they plan to re-evaluate whether they will need to extend closures after assessing the ongoing threats of pandemic. The OCDE Newsroom is working to compile a complete list of district closures and will post it when it’s available.</p>
<p>Here’s the full statement from Superintendent Al Mijares:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused great anxiety in our schools and communities. While local health officials believe the risk of infection to the public in Orange County is low, we do not yet know how this will ultimately impact our county. Simply put, we are in uncharted waters, and the time has come to hit the pause button until we know more.</em></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As a precautionary step to slow and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and after careful deliberations with local school district leaders and in consultation with the Orange County Health Care Agency, I hereby support the decision of schools and districts in our county to suspend all activity for a minimum of 14 days.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This is not a decision we take lightly. We know that temporarily closing a school has a tremendous impact on our families, and steps will need to be implemented to support the continuity of learning and to ensure students have access to healthy meals. But the safety of our students and staff remains our top priority, and we have confidence that this is the proper precautionary course for Orange County.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>At this time, there has been no evidence of a case affecting a student or staff member at an Orange County school. The Orange County Health Care Agency continues to work with federal, state, and local partners including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and health care providers on preparedness efforts and to guide appropriate care for those who may be at risk for illness associated with the virus.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Meanwhile, the Orange County Department of Education has been <a href="https://ocde.instructure.com/courses/224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepping up its efforts to produce content and materials</a> to help support learning at home. While it is not possible to replace an instructional day or provide comprehensive course content with online resources or take-home packets, we can develop resources and strategies to provide a continuity of learning.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Districts that dismiss students due to pandemics will be eligible to seek funding emergency relief through the California Department of Education’s J-13A waiver process. In addition, we are asking California’s educational leaders to provide credit for lost instructional time.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The Orange County Department of Education will continue to work diligently with local districts to make sure our schools and students are supported during and after this hiatus.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Thank you for your efforts to keep our children and our communities safe.</em></p>

<h2>State: Large gatherings should be suspended through March</h2>
<p>California public health officials announced late Wednesday night that large gatherings should be postponed or canceled across the state until at least the end of March.</p>
<p>Intended to control and slow the spread of COVID-19, the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated policy from the state Department of Public Health</a> says “non-essential” gatherings must be limited to no more than 250 people. Smaller events can proceed only if organizers can implement social distancing of 6 feet per person. Gatherings of individuals who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should be limited to no more than 10 people while also following social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>As affirmed this morning by the Orange County Health Care Agency, the guidance does not apply to regular school classes, workplaces or other essential services.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The state’s updated policy defines a gathering as any event or convening that brings together people in a single room or single space at the same time, such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, cafeteria or any other indoor or outdoor space.</p>
<p>According to the Public Health Department, social distance measures have proven effective in prior pandemics at delaying rates of transmission and reducing illness and death. The goals are to limit the number of Californians who contract COVID-19 before a vaccine or treatment is available, protect those most vulnerable and ensure that our health care systems and workforce aren’t overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“Changing our actions for a short period of time will save the life of one or more people you know,” Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement. “That’s the choice before us. Each of us has extraordinary power to slow the spread of this disease.”</p>
<p>Orange County has four documented cases of COVID-19 and two presumptive positive that are pending confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is currently no evidence of community transmission in the county.</p>
<p>On Thursday, OCDE announced that it would <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/nearly-500-students-prepare-for-national-history-day-orange-county-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hold this weekend’s National History Day events virtually</a>, and the Orange County Academic Pentathlon will be postponed until further notice.</p>

<h2>State health officials urge individuals at higher risk to take extra precautions</h2>
<p>Californians who are at a higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 should take extra precautions, <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-016.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the state Department of Public Health says</a>.</p>
<p>Early information out of China indicates some groups may be more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. Those more likely to get sick include older adults, individuals with compromised immune systems, and individuals who have serious chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, limited reporting data suggests that children with confirmed cases of COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have generally had milder symptoms</a>. Severe complications have been reported, but “they appear to be uncommon.”</p>
<p>Experts continue to reinforce common-sense preventative measures like thorough hand-washing to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. Those at higher risk for serious illness because of their age or health are especially urged to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or having been in a public place.</li>
<li>Avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay away from large gatherings and crowds.</li>
<li>Stay home as much as possible. Consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social or commercial networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Orange County currently has two confirmed COVID cases and three presumptive cases that have yet to be officially confirmed, according to <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the county Health Care Agency</a>.</p>

<h2>California releases new coronavirus guidance for schools, colleges and large events</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on existing plans and the latest science on how the COVID-19 virus is transmitted, state health officials on Saturday issued </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdph.ca.gov%2FPrograms%2FCID%2FDCDC%2FCDPH%2520Document%2520Library%2FSchool%2520Guidance_ADA%2520Compliant_FINAL.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7CJGood%40OCHCA.COM%7Cfdfa4ddceaa744f38a7f08d7c307656e%7Ce4449a56cd3d40baae3225a63deaab3b%7C0%7C1%7C637192308852289673&amp;sdata=%2Bu218JlmvlF37OQ0NCJOw4lx3txC3iXLLwtr7UUWp%2Fc%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new guidance for schools, colleges and universities</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a question of when — not if — some California public schools will face closure because of COVID-19,” Governor Gavin Newsom said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-014.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a news release</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “School districts must prepare for these scenarios so that parents and children can plan for what would happen if their local school faced closure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Scenarios and examples</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest guidance for schools is broken into four potential scenarios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f the local public health department has confirmed two or more community transmission cases, but students or staff have not tested positive for COVID-19, the Department of Public Health says staff with any fever or respiratory infection symptoms should not come to work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDPH also says schools should consider alternatives to large gatherings, such as assemblies, under this scenario.</span></p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one student or staff member tests positive for COVID-19 and has exposed others at the school, CDPH recommends that school administrators should work in consultation with the local health department to determine if a school closure is warranted and for what length of time.</span></p>
<p>Orange County currently has one confirmed COVID-19 case — a man in his 50s who has recovered — and three “presumptive positive” cases that are pending confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All of these cases are travel-related, meaning there’s still no evidence of community transmission locally.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In areas without community transmission, the state says schools and districts should be reviewing and updating their comprehensive school safety plans, including continuity plans for teaching and learning if students are absent from school. Based on federal guidelines, students, teachers or staff who have traveled to countries </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a Level 3 Travel Health Notice</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — currently China, Iran, Italy and South Korea — should stay home from school for 14 days from the time of their last exposure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In counties with evidence of community transmission, organizers should anticipate that some non-essential events may need to be modified — such as making the event a webinar — canceled or postponed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers should consider canceling non-essential events primarily attended by older adults and people with chronic medical conditions who are at higher risk for severe illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand Californians are concerned about the spread of COVID-19 and remind them that the best way to protect yourself and others is by washing your hands, covering your sneeze or cough, staying away from others who are sick, and staying home if you are sick,” said Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health and state health officer. “This new guidance is designed to help California improve preparation and prevention.” </span></p>

<h2>CDC expands self-quarantine advisory to additional countries</h2>
<p>The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanded its self-quarantine advisory to additional countries</a>.</p>
<p>Recent travelers to countries with a Level 3 Travel Health Notice — currently China, Iran, Italy and South Korea — are urged to stay home from work and school and take social distancing precautions for 14 days from the time they left.</p>
<p>Here are the steps recommended by the CDC for those returning from Level 3 countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.</li>
<li>Stay home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period. Discuss your work situation with your employer before returning to work.</li>
<li>Do not take public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing social distancing.</li>
<li>Avoid crowded places (such as shopping centers and movie theaters) and limit your activities in public.</li>
<li>Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).</li>
</ul>
<p>The CDC has previously stated that students under self-quarantine should be excused from school during this period.</p>

<h2>Long before the current coronavirus, OCDE and the OC Health Care Agency developed a pandemic plan</h2>
<p>This coronavirus may be novel, but the Orange County Department of Education has long had a plan in place for dealing with a potential pandemic.</p>

<p>About 10 years ago, OCDE and the Orange County Health Care Agency worked together to develop <a href="http://www.healthdisasteroc.org/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=11044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Pandemic Influenza School Planning Workbook For Orange County Schools</a>. The 60-page manual for schools and districts was designed to provide general guidance in the event of an influenza pandemic, but it’s adaptable to COVID-19 and other emergency scenarios.</p>
<p>The workbook outlines roles, responsibilities and considerations to keep students and employees safe — and to ensure the continuity of educational and operational services. It includes worksheets, checklists and sample letters.</p>
<p>“The safety and well-being of students and staff has always been the top priority of the Orange County Department of Education, which works year-round to bolster emergency preparedness plans in collaboration with districts and their leadership,” County Superintendent Dr. Al Mijares said Friday.</p>
<p>The risk to the general public remains low in Orange County, which has one confirmed case of COVID-19 — a man in his 50s who has since recovered — and two “presumptive positive” cases that are pending confirmation from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The HCA says it’s following up directly with all individuals who have had close contact.</p>
<p>“This remains a rapidly evolving situation, and there is still a lot we still don’t know, including how and when Orange County may be impacted,” Mijares said. “But our strong regional partnerships and proactive planning ensure we are in a state of readiness moving forward.”</p>

<p>They go on to list common-sense preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing, avoiding close contact with those who are sick and covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve.</p>

<p>At the state level, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a State of Emergency on Wednesday to make additional resources available, formalize emergency actions and help state agencies prepare for the broader spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The proclamation comes as the number of positive cases continues to rise, and it follows the first coronavirus-related fatality in the state. A <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-04/los-angeles-county-declares-coronavirus-emergency-6-new-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">man from Placerville County</a> died after falling ill with the virus on a cruise ship.</p>
<p>“The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus,” Gov. Newsom said. “This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our health care system in the event it spreads more broadly.”</p>
<p>Orange County has one confirmed case of COVID-19 — a man in his 50s who has since recovered — and two “presumptive positive” cases are pending confirmation from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The HCA said it is following up directly with all individuals who have had close contact.</p>

<h2>OC Health Care Agency offers guidance to schools, announces two more possible COVID-19 cases in Orange County</h2>
<p>After holding a conference call with local schools and districts, the <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orange County Health Care Agency</a> on Tuesday announced that its Public Health Laboratory had found two additional “presumptive positive” cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>They include a man in his 60s and a woman in her 30s who recently traveled to “countries with widespread transmission.” The local agency is following up with anyone who has had close contact with either person.</p>
<p>The HCA said it is sending its testing samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If confirmed, that would bring the total number of cases in Orange County to three. A man in his 50s has already recovered from the infection.</p>
<p>“The more you look for something, the more likely you are to find it,” County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick said. “Now that our Public Health Laboratory is able to perform COVID-19 testing, we expect to see more cases here in Orange County.”</p>
<p>Earlier that afternoon, HCA officials held a conference call with local school officials to provide an update on the novel coronavirus and general guidance for Orange County’s campuses.</p>

<p>Dr. Quick said that if any additional cases are found with a connection to an Orange County school, the Health Care Agency will immediately reach out to that school and district to provide guidance.</p>
<p>“If there is anything that a school district or individual school needs to take action on, you will be hearing from us,” she said.</p>
<p>The agency said it is not asking residents to take social distancing measures, such as avoiding public gatherings. Schools should not exclude any students out of fear, she said.</p>
<p>Per CDC guidelines, the 14-day self-quarantine applies only to travelers returning to the United States from mainland China.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, limited reporting data suggests that children with confirmed cases of COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have generally had mild symptoms</a>. Though severe complications have been reported, “they appear to be uncommon.”</p>
<p>“From all appearances this is a disease that kids are not getting severely ill from,” Quick said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/guidance-for-schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest school guidance from the CDC</a> encourages school administrators to review and update their emergency plans in collaboration with local health departments and other partners. Plans should include strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>Local health officials continued to emphasize common-sense steps to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Avoiding close contact with people who are sick</li>
<li>Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth</li>
<li>Staying home when you are sick</li>
<li>Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throwing the tissue in the trash</li>
<li>Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe</li>
<li>Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing (If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>No need to avoid public events, local health officials say</h2>
<p>The Orange County Health Care Agency affirmed over the weekend that it is not advising OC residents to avoid —  or hosts to cancel — public events due to concerns related to the COVID-19 coronavirus.</p>
<p>That guidance is in line with what federal and state officials are saying.</p>
<p>“If that changes, you’ll hear from us,” the <a href="https://twitter.com/ochealth?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">county agency posted on Twitter</a>. “Staying home because you’re coughing or sneezing, however, is just good common sense.”</p>
<p>Orange County has just one confirmed case of the COVID-19 virus, and that patient — a man in his 50s — has recovered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the HCA announced this weekend that it is now able to test for potential cases. Based on a criteria established by the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency will test:</p>
<ul>
<li>those with a fever or lower respiratory illness who had close contact with a COVID-19 case within 14 days of the onset of symptoms</li>
<li>those with a fever and lower respiratory illness requiring hospitalization with a history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of symptom onset</li>
<li>and those with fever and severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization that is otherwise unexplained.</li>
</ul>
<p>The HCA tweeted on Sunday that it has already had hundreds of consultations with physicians asking whether specific patients qualify for testing.</p>
<p>“The majority of patients have not met CDC criteria,” the HCA said.</p>
<p>Testing is arranged through each individual’s health care provider and/or hospital. Walk-ups to the HCA lab will not be accommodated.</p>
<p><span style="caret-color: #404040; color: #404040;">The CDC continues to advise</span><span style="caret-color: #404040; color: #404040;"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/5-healthy-habits-to-get-you-through-cold-and-flu-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular preventative measures</a><span style="caret-color: #404040; color: #404040;"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><span style="caret-color: #404040; color: #404040;">to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including hand-washing and covering up coughs and sneezes.</span></p>

<h2>Health Care Agency declares emergency; still only one confirmed case in OC</h2>
<p>In response to the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus and the likelihood of additional cases in Orange County, the county’s top health official on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=112434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared a health emergency</a>.</p>
<p>Orange County still has just one confirmed case — a man in his 50s who has since recovered. Nevertheless, County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick signed a local health emergency declaration one day after the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it anticipated more U.S. cases.</p>
<p>“This is part of broader preparedness efforts and will help ensure our response remains flexible and can evolve as the situation does,” the Orange County Health Care Agency <a href="https://twitter.com/ochealth/status/1232804897717809152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced via Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The California Department of Education said Wednesday it was monitoring the situation and working closely with agency partners. State officials referred to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/Coronavirus%20K-12%20Schools%20Guidance%202_7_20%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous guidance from the California Department of Public Health</a> and encouraged school districts to identify plans and protocols for communicating with families, adding that districts should consider how they might support teaching and learning in the event of a school closure.</p>
<p>“Any decisions to close schools as a result of the coronavirus would be made by individual LEAs (school districts) and their respective county health agencies,” the CDE wrote in an email. “LEAs should consider <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ep/schoolclosurecons.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these factors</a>, in addition to any other relevant local conditions or concerns, when deciding to close a school.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/nCOV2019.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Department of Public Health</a> continue to post updates about the coronavirus on their websites.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus risk to general public in U.S. remains low, but more cases are expected</h2>
<p>The national <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> says the immediate risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus remains low for Americans, but more cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including in the United States.</p>
<p>“Global efforts at this time are focused concurrently on containing spread of this virus and mitigating the impact of this virus,” the CDC says on its website. “The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the California Department of Public Health, in <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/Coronavirus%20K-12%20Schools%20Guidance%202_7_20%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidance issued to schools and districts</a>, says travelers from mainland China who arrive in the United States should stay home from school for 14 days as a precaution — beginning the day after they left China.</p>
<p>“Please note that there have been reports of students and others being stigmatized,” the CDPH guidance says. “We urge schools to ensure students’ and staffs’ privacy to help prevent discrimination.”</p>
<p>The state’s Public Health Department encourages students, parents and staff to continue taking everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staying home when sick</li>
<li>Washing hands frequently</li>
<li>Covering coughs with a sleeve or tissue</li>
<li>Having ample tissues within easy reach, as well as no-touch trash cans</li>
<li>Routinely cleaning frequently touched surfaces</li>
<li>Separating sick students and staff from others until they can go home</li>
</ul>

<h2>OC Health Care Agency updates guidance for schools and colleges</h2>
<p>The Orange County Health Care Agency on Friday updated its <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=110490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidance for schools, colleges and universities</a>, and officials have posted <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=111619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new recommendations specific to preschools and childcare facilities</a>.</p>
<p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is asking healthy travelers returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, noting that students who self-quarantine should be excused from school during this period.</p>
<p>The Health Care Agency says it is contacting individuals who meet that criteria to provide instructions for self-quarantine upon their return. HCA officials say they will also contact them at the end of their quarantine period.</p>
<p>Those identified at the highest risk of developing illness are being monitored by federal, state and/or local public health officials, according to the HCA’s guidance. If the high-risk person being monitored is a student, the HCA will exclude them from school for 14 days from their last exposure and will communicate with the school, college or university to ensure the student is excluded for the identified period.</p>
<p>“This is a rapidly evolving situation and as guidance on this subject changes, the HCA will provide updates,” the agency says.</p>
<p>The CDC is not currently recommending that masks be mandated for staff or students. It does, however, acknowledge that the wearing of masks is common in many countries, saying individuals should exercise their own discretion in their use.</p>
<p>The guidance adds that “face masks are most useful for preventing disease spread when they are worn by people who have symptoms. This is why people are asked to wear a mask at doctors’ offices and hospitals if they are coughing or sneezing. As always, the HCA recommends that persons who are ill stay home to limit transmission of all viruses.”</p>

<h2>Health Care Agency issues guidance for schools, colleges and universities</h2>
<p>A day after federal officials declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency in the U.S., the Orange County Health Care Agency has <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/School-Guidance-February-1-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued interim guidance for schools, colleges and universities</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the emergency declaration, travelers returning from China will face a health screening and up to two weeks of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they pose no health risk. The HCA says students who self-quarantine should be excused from school during this period.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/School-Guidance-February-1-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright wp-image-17546" src="https://i0.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-01-at-9.17.12-PM.png?resize=277%2C358&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of Health Care Agency guidance" width="277" height="358" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-01-at-9.17.12-PM.png?w=545&amp;ssl=1 545w, https://i0.wp.com/newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-01-at-9.17.12-PM.png?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>School nurses and student health centers should follow standard environmental infection control procedures for healthcare settings, according to the agency. If students report symptoms, school officials should ask if they have recently traveled to China.</p>
<p>Orange County continues to have only one confirmed case of novel coronavirus — a man in his 50s has been isolated and is in good condition — and there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission locally. Health Care Agency officials say the risk to the public in the county and throughout the United States remains low.</p>
<p>The HCA issued its guidance for schools and other educational settings on Saturday evening. Along with general information on the novel coronavirus, the five-page document outlines the steps the agency is taking to ensure the safety of residents and health care workers and offers strategies to help prevent the spread of respiratory illness.</p>

<h2>CDC not recommending surgical masks for the public</h2>
<p>Reflecting concerns about the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus outbreak</a> that started in China, surgical masks are increasingly appearing on school campuses and have become popular enough in the U.S. that some <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-us-masks-prevention-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retailers are selling out</a>.</p>
<p>But are surgical masks effective?</p>
<p>While experts say there’s not really any harm in wearing them, they are not considered an effective way for asymptomatic people to avoid influenza and other airborne respiratory viruses, says Pamela Kahn, OCDE’s coordinator of Health and Wellness.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a surgical mask, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandDifferenceInfographic-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlike the tight-fitting N95 respirator worn by physicians</a>, “does not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles and is not considered respiratory protection.”</p>
<p>The CDC isn’t recommending wearing masks in public. But officials say Americans should frequently and thoroughly wash their hands, cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, avoid contact with people who are sick, and stay home if they experience symptoms commonly associated with the flu. In fact, here are some <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/5-healthy-habits-to-get-you-through-cold-and-flu-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proven ways to help stop the spread of germs</a> and prevent respiratory illnesses.</p>

<h2>Agencies recommend regular flu prevention measures</h2>
<p>Because the novel coronavirus that originated in China has so far not been found to be spreading from person to person in the United States, no additional precautions are recommended for the general public, County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxm2WGXcGg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Monday in a video statement</a>.</p>
<p>“Our residents should go about their daily lives with no changes to planned activities,” Dr. Quick said.</p>
<p>The OC Health Care Agency said it will issue new guidance should circumstances change. In the meantime, the CDC continues to advise <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/5-healthy-habits-to-get-you-through-cold-and-flu-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular preventative measures</a> to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including hand-washing and covering up coughs and sneezes.</p>
<p>For those who have recently traveled to Wuhan, China and feel sick, <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the HCA website</a> advises to avoid contact with others and seek medical care immediately. Before going to a doctor’s office or emergency room, patients should call ahead and tell the medical staff about their recent travel and symptoms.</p>
<p>Here’s Dr. Quick’s full statement:</p>

<h2>Local coronavirus case confirmed; public remains at low risk</h2>
<p>The Orange County Health Care Agency has issued an update on the novel coronavirus outbreak that originated in China.</p>
<p>The agency confirmed over the weekend that a man in his 50s had tested positive for the virus in Orange County after traveling to Wuhan, China. There is no evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred within the county, and HCA officials say the risk of infection to the public in Orange County is low.</p>
<p>“If you have not been to Wuhan, China, or been in close contact with someone who has been to Wuhan and is sick, your risk is very low,” the <a href="http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HCA says on its website</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are <a href="https://newsroom.ocde.us/5-healthy-habits-to-get-you-through-cold-and-flu-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proven ways to stop the spread of germs and prevent respiratory illnesses</a>, including influenza.</p>
<p>The HCA said it provided guidance to the traveler upon his arrival to reduce exposure to the public while they awaited lab results from the CDC. The man is currently in good condition at a local hospital, where he is being treated in isolation.</p>
<p>The California Department of Public Health says another case has been confirmed in Los Angeles County. No others have been identified in California.</p>
<p>“The California Department of Public Health has been preparing for this situation by working closely with local health departments and health care providers,” said CDPH Director and State Health Officer Dr. Sonia Angell.</p>
<p>“We are supporting ongoing efforts by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and the Orange County Health Care Agency to respond to these cases, and will continue working with our partners to monitor for any additional cases that may occur in California, to ensure that persons can be safely and effectively evaluated for this novel virus, and to protect the health of the people of California,” Angell said.</p>
<p>The first known cases of 2019-nCoV — short for “2019 novel coronavirus” — were reported in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS. A novel coronavirus — often shown as “nCoV” — is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.</p>
<p>In consultation with the CDC and the California Department of Public Health, the HCA said it was following up directly with all individuals who have had close contact with the local case and are at risk of infection.</p>

The VSA Festival is a free, daylong event that’s typically held at MainPlace Mall in Santa Ana on a Saturday in April. But California’s stay-at-home directive and national social distancing measures mean the 44th annual celebration will look a bit different.⁣
⁣
Instead of an in-person experience, organizers have created a virtual festival, featuring links to a 200-piece art gallery, 15 performance videos, video messages from special guests and educational activities to help students learn more about individuals with disabilities.⁣

The virtual celebration launches today, April 18, and can be found here:⁣

            	                    <img src="https://newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/img/placeholder.png" alt="On Friday, March 13, school districts across Orange County made the difficult decision to temporarily dismiss students in response to COVID-19 fears and calls for social distancing. At the time we found it necessary to hit the pause button so we could better understand the novel coronavirus and its transmission. Many of our districts announced campus closures of two to three weeks and later extended those timelines based on guidance from state and local health officials.⁣
⁣
This has placed our schools in a holding pattern, and it has been difficult for families to make long-term plans. Now, as we enter a new phase in our understanding of the threat, it is time to address the reality that our efforts to flatten the curve and keep students safe cannot be accomplished in the span of a few weeks or even a month. Even President Trump has called for social distancing measures to continue through April, which for many of our districts would leave only a few weeks to wrap up the school year. Therefore, in alignment with today’s statements from Governor Gavin Newsom and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, I am recommending that school districts in Orange County cancel student attendance on campuses through the end of this academic year and channel their efforts toward adopting robust and effective distance learning models.⁣

Inspired by social media, counselor Kim Coronado came up with the idea and enlisted the DHH staff, including the principal, teachers, paraeducators, interpreters, the school psychologist, an audiologist, the school nurse, an administrative assistant, and a speech and language pathologist. Teacher Chris Gonzales edited the clips together.⁣

“All I know is, after the hardest week I’ve ever endured as not only an educator but a human, I woke up more invigorated than I have all week,” Principal David Longo told his team. “We will get through this, and I feel that more than I ever have.”⁣

The idea is that minimizing social contact can effectively slow the spread of a virus so you don’t get a huge wave of illnesses all at once. If that were too happen, a community might not have enough hospital beds or staff to manage patient care.

As explained in this brief video produced by OCDE’s Media Services, infectious disease experts say it helps to spread cases out over weeks or months so that health care systems can keep pace.

            	                    <img src="https://newsroom.ocde.us/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/img/placeholder.png" alt="Important message from OC Supt. of Schools regarding #COVID-19

As a precautionary step to slow and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and after careful deliberations with local school district leaders and in consultation with the OC Health Care Agency, I hereby support the decision of schools and districts in our county to suspend all activity for a minimum of 14 days.

This is not a decision we take lightly. We know that temporarily closing a school has a tremendous impact on our families, and steps will need to be implemented to support the continuity of learning and to ensure students have access to healthy meals. But the safety of our students and staff remains our top priority, and we have confidence that this is the proper precautionary course for Orange County.

At this time, county health officials believe the risk of transmission is low, and there has been no evidence of a case affecting a student or staff member at an Orange County school. The Orange County Health Care Agency continues to work with federal, state, and local partners including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and health care providers on preparedness efforts and to guide appropriate care for those who may be at risk for illness associated with the virus.

The Orange County Department of Education has been stepping up its efforts to produce content and materials to help support learning at home. While it is not possible to replace an instructional day or provide comprehensive course content with online resources or take-home packets, we can develop resources and strategies to provide a continuity of learning.

Districts that dismiss students due to pandemics will be eligible to seek funding emergency relief through the California Department of Education’s J-13A waiver process. In addition, we are asking California leaders to provide credit for lost instructional time.

OCDE will continue to work diligently with local districts to make sure our schools and students are supported during and after this hiatus. Thank you for your efforts to keep our children and our communities safe. Read more at newsroom.ocde.us"></a>

⁣
Theresa is an Applications Support Analyst in the Information Technology Division with OCDE.⁣
⁣
She provides support to the Business applications such as Payroll, HR, and Time and Attendance. Although her technical skills are not a part of direct student learning, they do impact the teachers and administrators who serve OC students in the classroom by making sure their time and attendance is tracked correctly and they get paid on time and continue to work each day. “Another day at work for them is another opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our students.”⁣
⁣
Theresa’s decision to work at the Orange County Department of Education was driven in part by the spirit of collaboration and teamwork that the organization promotes. “Being able to work with teams from other departments has allowed me to learn so much more about the great difference that OCDE makes in the community.”⁣
