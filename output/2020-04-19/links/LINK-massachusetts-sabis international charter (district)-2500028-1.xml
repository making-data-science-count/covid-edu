We will help direct your concern to the appropriate personnel. </p> <p>We are looking into different modes to make our remote learning plan accessible to all.  We learned from our online and phone surveys that we have students that will need paper and pencil packets.  Please call us if a paper and pencil packet is needed during our remote learning months. </p> <p><strong>Calling hours are:</strong></p> <p><strong>Monday - Friday 9-11AM  </strong></p> <p><strong>Grades K-5:     (413) 783-3434</strong></p> <p><strong>Grades 6-12:   (413) 783-2600 </strong></p> <p> </p> </div> <p><strong>UPDATE 4/9/20</strong></p> <p>Here are instructions on how to use your smart phone to participate in online activities: (THANK YOU Mrs. Mudgett)</p> <div data-oembed-url="https://youtu.be/2x6nc1nu7Ak"> <div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2x6nc1nu7Ak?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div> </div> <p><strong>UPDATE 4/9/20:</strong></p> <p>Dear SICS families,</p> <p>Due to the rapid responses and participation for the technology survey we are extending it until 3P today.  Please click on link below (UPDATE 4/8/20) to complete the survey if you haven’t already.
