<h2><strong>Latest Update – 4/17/2020</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p dir="ltr">I hope you and your families are doing well. We sincerely miss seeing your children at school. Teachers have reported that they are enjoying engaging with students, but we all realize this is not the same as personally being with them each day. Our staff has been working hard to support students who may be struggling emotionally or academically. If your child/ren need further support and assistance, please reach out to us.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although we have been told by the Governor that we are closed for the remainder of the year, we are brainstorming ways to acknowledge the accomplishments of our seniors. When events are finalized, we will share them with all of you so that we can celebrate together as a community.  <strong>Please note changes in food distribution for next week below.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Our next food distribution will take place on April 22nd with a rain date of April 23rd. Although our distributions are for students who are on Free and Reduced lunch/breakfast, the district has filed a waiver to open assistance up to any student whose family is experiencing food insecurity and significant hardship. If your child/ren are NOT designated as Free and Reduced and you would like to take advantage of this assistance, you must fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/EzySWzoQ5x4W27Hc9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.gle/EzySWzoQ5x4W27Hc9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587230834998000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFomc5uvX2WzZeZ7mtDO2wmKZBLGA">form</a> so that we can plan for the right amount of food during each distribution. Even if you filled this form out before, you must fill it out for each distribution. Also, if you fill out the form, it is expected that you attend and receive food. We are paying for additional food based on this form and several employees are volunteering their time to prepare food bags. If you indicate that you will attend and do not show up, the food will go to waste. Furthermore, employees will be out of their homes for longer times than necessary. If your children are already designated as free/reduced you do not need to complete this form each time.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSencF40m2g0t3WFCvBgkWHLaS93SYUG7HQmlT-5S-Bbu0Ujfg/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSencF40m2g0t3WFCvBgkWHLaS93SYUG7HQmlT-5S-Bbu0Ujfg/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587230834999000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFO3tjTTdT9Srmm8CZYz5CNtQo1IQ">Food Sign Up Form</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, we are asking ALL families that come for food distribution to clear out their trunks. For the safety of our workers, we will no longer be leaning into vehicles to put groceries into cars. To limit the time that individuals are out of their homes, (both families and employees), we will only be distributing food from 12 PM – 1 PM moving forward  Please come to the back loop on Highland Avenue between 12 PM and 1 PM and release your trunk. Bags of groceries will be placed in your trunk for your children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I realize that as the weeks go on, it is more and more difficult to cope with the restrictions we are experiencing. Thank you for your patience and support as we work through our Continuity of Education Plan. I know this new form of education for your child/ren is not ideal, and often frustrating. That being said, we are here for all families. If there is a way we can enhance your child/ren’s educational experience, please reach out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stay safe and be well,</p>

<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that this correspondence finds you and your family in good health. During this first week navigating our Continuity of Education phase of our online learning, you may have experienced certain challenges. We completely understand that this is a new teaching environment for our staff (AND for you as parents/guardians) and a new learning environment for our students. That being said, there may be some days that run smoother than others. Please be patient with your children and this process. It will take everyone time to adjust to this new instructional plan. We thank everyone who completed our online acknowledgment form, and remind the few families who have not, to complete it as soon as possible. Please note that during Spring Break, students are not required to complete work. This is truly a break and we would like you to spend some quality time with your family.</p>
<p>With the newest mandate from the Governor, our schools are closed indefinitely, but at least until April 30, 2020. During this time, all school functions are canceled and events in May and June could be as well. As of now, the only events that we are actively discussing are Prom, 6th Grade Graduation, and H.S. Graduation. This does not mean that other events will not be considered if possible, but there is so much uncertainty right now that we cannot plan accordingly.</p>
<p>As mentioned in previous correspondences, our next food distribution will take place on April 8th with a rain date of April 9th. As of now, our distributions have been for students who are on Free and Reduced lunch/breakfast. The district has filed a waiver to open this up to any student whose family is experiencing food insecurity and significant hardship. If your child/ren are NOT designated as Free and Reduced and you would like to take advantage of this assistance, you must fill out this form (<a href="https://forms.gle/N3kFgBWT1pybJXYi8">https://forms.gle/N3kFgBWT1pybJXYi8</a>) so that we can plan for the right amount of food during each distribution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are asking ALL families that come for food distribution to clear out their trunks. For the safety of our workers, we will no longer be leaning into vehicles to put groceries into cars. Please come to the back loop on Highland Avenue between the hours of 12 PM and 2 PM and release your trunk. Bags of groceries will be placed in your trunk for your children.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and assistance during this difficult time. We are here to support you and we encourage you to reach out to us if needed.</p>
<p>Stay safe and be well,</p>

<p><strong>3/26/2020</strong></p>
<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p><strong>In an effort to consolidate information and to not flood your inbox, I am combining two important announcements in this message. Please read the following correspondence carefully. It contains information regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19) transmission AND online learning, which will begin on Monday, March 30th. </strong></p>
<p><strong>COVID- 19 Transmission</strong></p>
<p>As community transmission of the Coronavirus continues to spread throughout our state, there are more cases of individuals testing positive within our county. Furthermore, it has come to our attention that there are cases of COVID-19 within the Borough of Jenkintown.</p>
<p>Our schools have been closed since March 12, 2020. Today, March 26, 2020, marks the final day of the 14 day incubation period. Please know that after today, any individual who begins to develop symptoms of COVID-19 will fall outside of the period of school transmission. It is important to note that the Montgomery County Office of Public Health (MCOPH) has informed us that they are no longer conducting contact tracing for schools, as schools have been closed for this duration. Therefore, I will not receive information to share regarding any specific transmission in Jenkintown.</p>
<p>The spread of COVID-19 will likely continue within our community. We remind you to continue practicing social distancing if you must leave your home during Governor Wolf’s stay-at-home order. All of our fields and play areas are closed to the public and we ask that you please monitor your children and assure that they are not congregating outside. Also, please remind all members of your family to practice proper hygiene. We need your assistance to stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Online Learning</strong></p>
<p>As you are aware, for these past two weeks, teachers have been providing maintenance and enrichment activities for students that are ungraded, optional assignments. Beginning this Monday, March 30, 2020, we will be transitioning to Continuity of Education. This means that students will be receiving required assignments that will be graded. Students are accountable for this work; however, if a family member becomes ill or if a child is unable to complete an assignment for any reason, please reach out to your child’s teacher and principal. We understand that these are stressful times and want to support families the best way possible. The following requirements are essential for students to understand regarding online learning, and we ask that you review these with your children each day.</p>
<p><strong>Student Expectations:<br></strong><br> Students are expected to continue to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner at all times. Their behavior should be aligned with school policies and procedures. If students’ actions do not meet these expectations they will be subject to intervention by school administrators.</p>
<p>All students are to adhere to the same standards of behavior online as they would face-to-face. They must be respectful and polite to teachers and peers. Teasing, harassment and bullying will not be tolerated. All students are expected to support one another.</p>
<p>Students are not permitted to take or post images, videos or screenshots of classmates, teachers or class content to the web or to social media. This will not be tolerated and subject to disciplinary consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Important Information: </strong></p>
<p>Learning and engagement will be offered asynchronously for Elementary students. This means that the time and place of the instruction will not limit the opportunity to access content. Content can be viewed at varying times, discussion boards that offer flexibility, and submissions that are open for 24 hours or more are all examples of things that our students can complete when time allows.</p>
<p>In addition to asynchronous opportunities, synchronous opportunities are available to Secondary students (meaning they login and engage with a teacher at a particular time), students will also have the opportunity to access the educational material provided at another time.</p>
<p>The district has turned OFF the video portion in Google Meet by default for all students. However, you may need to remind your child to not turn on their cameras. So, although a class may be “live” the students should not see each other as the cameras are turned off, unless directed by their teacher otherwise.</p>
<p>The time spent on virtual learning will vary for students depending on their grade levels and pacing. However, teachers will be working within guidelines. K-6 students should expect to spend approximately 1-2.5 hours a day and 7-12 students should expect to spend about 3 hours a day. These time frames include the teacher directed and independent portions of the lessons.</p>
<p>Student attendance will be accounted for by student engagement and participation. Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor daily assignments/lessons from the teacher. If students are not participating, the classroom teacher and/or school administrator will be reaching out.</p>
<p>At this time, Special area teachers are also developing supplemental activities and resources for students and families to complete at home.</p>
<p>Teachers will continue to assess students’ understanding of the materials as they normally do. All state standardized testing has been waived for this school year.</p>
<p>Teachers will be available to support student learning. Each teacher will provide further information on this directly to their students.</p>
<p>If your child is having difficulty with the academic tasks, please email the teacher to express your concerns. He/she will work with you to provide additional support or guidance for the assignments.</p>
<p>If your child experiences technology problems or you need assistance navigating this format, please contact cumminsj@jtowndrakes.org.</p>
<p>Jenkintown counselors are available to you and your students. Counselors can be reached via email. Counselors will also be reaching out to all students with whom they regularly meet.</p>
<p>We realize that students are entering an educational environment that may be new, different, or challenging for them. Additionally, teachers are modifying lessons and content in ways they may not have previously shared with students. Because of this, there may be growing pains. We ask that you are patient as we launch our online learning environment. We encourage you to reach out to teachers and administrators for support and guidance. Our students’ success and well-being is our number one priority.</p>
<p>Wishing you health and comfort during this most challenging time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jill A. Takacs, Ed.D.<br> Superintendent of Schools</p>
<p><strong>3/25/2020</strong></p>
<p>We are distributing food for free and reduced students tomorrow (Thursday, March 26th) between the hours of 12:00-2:00 PM because of the rain today. Please proceed to the back loop of the district on Highland Avenue. We will be distributing 2 weeks worth of groceries at a time to limit the time individuals need to leave their homes. The next time food will be distributed, after tomorrow, will by Wednesday, April 8th. Should rain be expected for this date, food will be distributed on Thursday, April 9th. I will send out an email blast to confirm this distribution earlier that week.</p>
<p>Please be aware that ALL fields and play areas are closed because of the Stay as Home Order issued by the Governor for Montgomery County. We ask that you please stay off of fields and play areas.</p>
<p>Thank you and stay safe!</p>
<p>Jill A. Takacs, Ed.D.<br> Superintendent of Schools</p>
<p><strong>3/23/2020</strong></p>
<p>Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>Based on the most recent guidance from Governor Wolf, our district will be closed for a minimum of 2 more weeks. Since this will put us in the middle of spring break, our anticipated return date, at this time, is Tuesday, April 14th. Last week, and this week, our teachers have been providing enrichment and review activities for students. Beginning Monday, March 30th, we will transition into planned instruction. This will look differently depending upon the grade level and subject matter; however, students are expected to be educationally engaged in the learning. Both Dr. Hart and Mr. Roller will send additional information in a separate email.</p>
<p>We understand that sharing a device among students can be difficult, and we are understanding in this matter. If your family does not have a device at all, please email your building principal and we may be able to provide your family with one. However, we ask that if you have a device, even if it is a shared device, you utilize it, because our supply of devices is extremely limited, and we need to reserve these devices for families without any device in their home at all.</p>
<p>This past weekend, our maintenance company, Interstate, performed electrostatic spraying in all classrooms, offices, and common areas to kill any germs that may still be in the building. They are also performing deep cleaning of all areas for our anticipated return.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I sent out an email asking everyone to stay off of our playgrounds and courts. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. It is extremely important that these areas are not used at all.  Additionally, based on Governor Wolf’s order to stay at home, NO ONE should be on our fields either, for at least the next 2 weeks. The Jenkintown Police will be patrolling our grounds and enforcing this order. I sincerely hope that everyone will assist us in the mission of social distancing and respect this decision.</p>
<p>Finally, we are committed to providing food for our Free and Reduced students; however, we will now be distributing 2 weeks worth of groceries at a time to limit the time individuals need to leave their homes. This week, we are moving food distribution to this Thursday, March 26th between the hours of 12:00-2:00 PM because it is supposed to rain on Wednesday. The next time food will be distributed after this date will by Wednesday, April 8th. Should rain be expected for this date, food will be distributed on Thursday, April 9th. I will send out an email blast to confirm this distribution earlier that week.</p>
<p>I understand that these are extremely stressful times for families and sincerely hope you are all well. We are here for you as a support system and encourage you to reach out to us if we can be of assistance. We are Jenkintown Strong and will get through this together. Cherish your family and please stay safe. I will keep you updated regularly.</p>

<div class="gmail_default"><p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p></div>
<div class="gmail_default">Yesterday we were able to provide several free and reduced breakfast/lunch students with groceries for the week. I am so appreciative of the teachers, Board members and administrators who were able to assist with this endeavor. We will be doing this again next Wednesday between the hours of  12 PM – 2 PM and hope that more families will be able to take advantage of this opportunity. Distribution of food occurs in our back loop on Highland Avenue.  Unfortunately, today we made the difficult decision to close our tennis courts and playground. Signs will be posted and we ask that you tell your children that these are restricted areas. We will keep our fields open for now because this is the only green space in the Borough; however, we are requesting that everyone stay 6 feet away from one another to practice social distancing. If we cannot maintain this, we may have to close off all areas.  We recognize that these are challenging times and want to remind you that we are here for you. Please feel free to reach out to one of our staff members if you or your children need assistance in any way.</div>

<p>Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>These are certainly unprecedented times and there is much confusion and uncertainty around our daily operations. Our routines have been interrupted and our sense of normalcy shaken.

<p>Dear Parents, Guardians, and Staff,</p>
<p>This afternoon, Governor Wolf announced that he will be closing all non-essential travel, services, and activities within Montgomery County, which includes our school communities. This decision was not made lightly but was made in an abundance of caution, as the public health benefits outweigh the challenges this decision presents us. Schools will be closed from March 13, 2020 through March 27, 2020. As of this most recent guidance, we anticipate students will return to school on March 30, 2020.</p>
<p>Teachers are providing various educational activities that children should work on while we are out of school these next two weeks. We understand that this circumstance may be challenging for students and families; however, our teachers worked hard to customize assignments most appropriate for their students. If you have any questions regarding these assignments, please email teachers directly.</p>
<p>As of now, breakfast and lunch for free and reduced students will not be distributed; however, if your family struggles with food insecurity, please contact Dr. Hart or Mr. Roller and they will follow up with Home and School (HSA) for assistance.</p>
<p>As of now, no one is permitted into our buildings so please refrain from coming to school. Our custodial and maintenance staff will be thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting our schools during this two-week period.</p>
<p>Please be advised that our Board of Education Meeting is cancelled for Monday, March 16, 2020. Dr. Hart and Mr. Roller will be communicating to you regarding building specific information.</p>
<p>This situation is unfolding rapidly and I will continue to communicate important information as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>I need to begin by telling you that this is a first in my career and quite frankly an e-mail that I have never really had to think about writing prior to today. I met with your children at the end of the day so that I could inform them in person that Governor Wolfe has mandated the closure of all Montgomery County Schools beginning tomorrow March 13. The expected return date is March 30, 2020. As this is a very changing situation, updates will be provided to school entities throughout the extended break and we will disseminate this information to you in a timely fashion. As you can imagine, this has had a far reaching effect on events in our district and I would like to highlight some of them below. Please accept my apology in advance if I miss anything, but as you can imagine this has been a very trying day.</p>
<p><strong>Parent-Teacher Conferences for March 19/20 have been postponed – New Date and Possible Format  – TBD</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graduation Project Presentations for March 27 have been postponed – New Dates TBD – (Ms. Zetts will communicate any updates to students) </strong></p>
<p><strong>All PIAA High School Athletic Events and Practices have been canceled</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PIAA State Championship Basketball Tournament has been postponed for at least 2 weeks. A final decision will be made after two weeks concerning the possible continuation of the tournament.<br></strong><br><strong>All School Board Meetings have been canceled<br></strong><br><strong>We will be sending information to Juniors and Seniors about Prom Permission Forms etc. over the next two weeks<br></strong><br><strong>We do not have any information pertaining to spring break at this time, but will share this information as soon as it becomes available</strong></p>
<p><strong>With regards to school work, our teachers are going to be utilizing google classroom and e-mail to communicate with students. The expectations for work completion will not be overwhelming. Teachers are aware that this is not the fault of the students and are not looking to “hammer” students with work. With that being said, I shared with the students that my expectation for them is to complete each assignment to the best of their ability while they are out of school. Teachers will be checking e-mails regularly to support students in need. Student grades will not be diminished or punished during this period of time, but successfully completing all work will allow them to be successful when they re-enter the regular school environment. Thank you for maintaining those expectations at home as well.<br></strong><br> In closing, I may have forgotten something and for that I apologize. As my door is literally open to all of you each day, it is figuratively open to you during this unexpected break. I will do my best to provide regular updates to our families and to respond to student and parent/guardian e-mails in a timely fashion. These are unchartered waters for all of us, but together we will work to make the best of a less than ideal situation. Please make sure you communicate with me should someone in your family be diagnosed with Covid-19. Our district will be working closely with neighboring districts and our county and state officials during this time.</p>
<p>Lastly, I stand committed to leading this building of wonderful professionals and terrific young people. As a community, I encourage you to rally around each other as you always do and make sure our young people feel supported as they navigate this unprecedented period in our country’s history. I wish you all health and peace. I’ll be in touch soon,</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Tom Roller<br> Principal</p>

<p>Parents, Guardians, and Staff,</p>
<p>As news of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) changes rapidly, so too is our response to contain the spread of the virus and keep our school community safe. District cleaning efforts have been increased and additional disinfecting is occurring each weekend. Furthermore, we are monitoring events in districts across our county, as well as updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), PA Department of Health, and the Montgomery County Health Department. We will be taking our guidance from these health organizations. The District has reviewed our emergency preparedness plan and devised a pandemic preparedness action plan to respond to and prepare for a potential school closure and/or quarantine period. At this time, we do not have any plans for school closure; however, this could change, with little notice, depending upon circumstances within our population. Our principals are meeting with our teaching staff to prepare work for home should extended school closures be warranted. We do feel it is prudent to restrict group gatherings of adults, who are not district employees, in our buildings until after Spring Break. We know that there are many events that you have been looking forward to attending; however, out of an abundance of caution, the following events are either cancelled or postponed.</p>
<p>K-1 Informances – cancelled<br> In House Reading Olympics – rescheduled TBD<br> Kindergarten Registration – All events the week of March 23 – cancelled. Families will be contacted directly to reschedule.<br> MS/HS Theater Arts Performance – Almost Maine- rescheduled for the weekend of April 16th, 17th, and 18th.<br> In person Parent/Teacher Conferences – will be changed to phone conferences. More information will be forthcoming from our principals.</p>
<p>At this time, outdoor sporting events will proceed as planned; however, we remind you to exercise proper hygiene procedures such as frequent handwashing and hand sanitizing; coughing into a sleeve; and self isolation if you become ill. We encourage all individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying health concerns to avoid crowds including Jenkintown sporting events.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding during these challenging times. We will continue to keep you updated as warranted.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jill A. Takacs, Ed.D.<br> Superintendent of Schools</p>
<p>To reinforce health safety and best practices for illness prevention, please read the list below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
<li>Follow the CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.</li>
<li>CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including Coronavirus.</li>
<li>Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms to help prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
<li> If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
</ul>
