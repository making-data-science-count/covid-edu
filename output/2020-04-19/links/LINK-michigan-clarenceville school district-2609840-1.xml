<h5>Parent Message - April 15, 2020 </h5>

<p>Good evening Clarenceville Families,</p>

<p>This communication contains four important items:</p>

<p>1. School is NOT over! School buildings are closed however, the state of Michigan expects/ requires that students will continue to have learning opportunities. These learning opportunities will include new material that would have been taught in a classroom. Now it will be taught through online platforms such as Google Classroom and SeeSaw. Should any family have difficulty with connectivity or having a Chromebook/laptop the school district stands ready to help solve these challenges. Learning packets is another way new learning can be delivered if online is not an option.  </p>

<p>2.<a href="/downloads/district_files/clarenceville_continuity_of_learning_guide_for_parents_and_students.pdf" target="_blank"> Click here to find our Parent/Student Guidance Document </a>explaining our Continuity of Learning Plan that the state requires all school districts to write and implement through the end of this school year.</p>

<p>3. Here is <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81630828811?pwd=Q0FRMmdLUjRraE9lTm15Tk12aXZodz09&amp;status=success" target="_blank">the link to a Zoom Parent Town Hall</a> meeting that will be held on Thursday night at 6:00 pm. </p>

<p>4. We are scheduling another Chromebook pickup date. It will be this Friday, April 17th. I am asking all parents who need a Chromebook or a second Chromebook to contact their building principal to let them know so we can have enough of them prepared for pickup. The first session will be for families who have not received a Chromebook from the district yet. This pickup will take place from 9 am to 11 am. The second pickup time on Friday will be from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. This pickup site is for those families who need more than one Chromebook because they have children attending different grade levels or schools in the district. The pickup site will be at the Clarenceville Middle School in the south parking lot (the stadium lot). You will be asked to sign a checkout document. This will be a "drive-up" service and you will not have to get out of your vehicle. The Town Hall meeting will focus on the Parent &amp; Student Guide document which is part of our Continuity of Learning Plan.</p>

<p>We will do our best to answer your questions during the Town Hall meeting. The meeting will be recorded and the link will be posted on our district website so that other parents who could not attend the Town Hall meeting can watch it at a later date. This way parents can hear and see what questions were asked and answered. Should they have other questions after viewing the video they can contact us by using the <a href="mailto:help@clarencevilleschools.org">help@clarencevilleschools.org</a> email address.  </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Paul Shepich, Superintendent of Schools</p>

<h5>Parent Message - April 3, 2020</h5>

<p>Good afternoon Clarenceville Families and Staff,</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Governor issued an Executive Order ending “face to face” instruction in all Michigan schools for the remainder of this school year. The Executive Order is seventeen pages in length. It gives very specific instructions for what all school districts must do for the remainder of the school year to continue giving our students opportunities to continue their learning to the end of this school year.</p>

<p>At this time, my administrative team is reviewing her Executive Order. We will be creating a Continuous Learning Plan for our school district’s teachers and students to follow. Once our plan is ready to be implemented it will be communicated to all teachers, students, and parents. Until such time, students should continue to follow what their teachers are currently providing.</p>

<p>This is a challenging and difficult time for all of us as we endeavor to stay healthy, continue to stay home in order to stay safe while trying to keep learning a priority in our students’ lives. If there was ever a time where we need one another this would be that time. Each of us has our own personal challenges to overcome; we need to be there for one another. The Clarenceville School District is making every effort to reach out to you in hopes you will share with us how we can better support you through this unprecedented time.</p>

<p>School, the joy of learning something new, has always been the bedrock of our lives. It is an essential in so many ways, now more than ever. Schools are not just about academics. Schools are so much more to our school community and it is during times like these that we can demonstrate the importance schools have in our lives; the concept of school is not found in buildings, school is about the people who fill them. School is a place for connection with one another as we strive to make things better for other people.</p>

<p>Our Continuous Learning Plan, once approved by the ISD and the Michigan Department of Education will not only be about continuing learning but more importantly it will be about keeping our connection to one another. I hope you will support your children and us in this endeavor.</p>

<p>I will be back in touch when we are ready to share our plan with all of you. Until then, please be safe, follow the social distancing and stay home order as best you can to keep yourself and others healthy. Your children should not be out and about playing with groups of kids on playgrounds, neighborhoods, basketball courts or football fields at this time. The more we follow the stay home order the sooner we can get back to our normal lives. It is a difficult time but I know as a community filled with Trojan Pride we can and will do what we need to do to make the best of a difficult situation so one day sooner rather than later we can all be back together as a school community.</p>

<p>Be well,</p>

<p>Paul K. Shepich, Superintendent</p>

<h5>Message sent to Clarenceville Parents on Friday, March 13, 2020.</h5>

<p>Good evening Clarenceville Families,</p>

<p>These are challenging times for the Clarenceville School District, our state, our country, and our world.  We are complying with the Governor’s directive to close all schools to students as of March 16, 2020.  The Clarenceville School District will resume school on Monday, April 6, 2020 after our Spring Break.</p>

<p>The closure is to mitigate the spread of the Coronavirus.  We are living in a time of rapidly changing information.  We are committed to sending regular communication and we appreciate your continued attention to these email messages. </p>

<p>Virtual Learning for CSD Students:</p>

<p>Our teachers are planning virtual learning opportunities along with other methodologies for those students who may not have home connectivity.  We know nothing can replace effective classroom instruction; however, we are doing our best to keep our students engaged in their learning during this mandated closure. </p>

<p>Should your student need a Chromebook and have home connectivity please email your building principal or call the building’s main office to request one.  A parent must be the person to sign out the requested Chromebook. </p>
