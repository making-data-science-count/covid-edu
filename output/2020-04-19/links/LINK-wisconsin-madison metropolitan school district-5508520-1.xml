<h2>Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse and Threats of School Violence</h2>

<p>We know that there have been recent new articles related to the potential increase in child abuse and neglect with school closures. We also know that mandated reports are much lower at this time, given that schools are not in session and educators are among the most likely to report child abuse and neglect.  </p>

<p>We have been in contact with <a href="https://danecountyhumanservices.org/ProtectiveServices/Child/reporting_child_abuse_and_neglect.aspx" target="_blank">Child Protective Services and Dane County Human Services</a> to discuss our protocols during school closure, and we have decided that we will continue to use our regular system for mandated reporting.  As detailed in Wisconsin Act 81, all MMSD staff are mandated reporters so if they suspect that a student is being abused and/or neglected, they are still required to make a report. </p>

<p>Also, as a reminder, Wisconsin Act 143 required all school district employees to report any threat -- whether spoken, written or symbolic -- to law enforcement (this includes Educational Resource Officers) if they believe that there is a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of others. <br>
 <br>
Both Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse and Threat of School Violence reporting procedures can be found on the District <a href="https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/besafe/">emergency procedures</a>.</p>

<h2>Teaching students about COVID-19 </h2>

<p>Many of our teachers have been using these presentations to teach students about COVID-19 and what they can do to stay safe and healthy. Students learn what a virus is; how they are spread; how to wear, wash and replace face masks; how to properly wash hands; what happens when people get sick with COVID-19 and how to keep themselves, their families and their communities safe. The version for middle and high school students goes into more detail on social distancing, what to do if someone at home gets sick and other topics. </p>

<p>We wanted you to have them as well if you would like to go over the content with your child. </p>

<h2>Our weekly virtual press conferences answer many of your question</h2>

<p>As we shared in yesterday's email, given this unprecedented time, we have started holding virtual press conferences each week. This is an opportunity for reporters to ask questions of the school board and administration. You can watch the conferences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiq4baXViPcY1gP8ddhJWOA/" target="_blank">live on this channel</a>. They are scheduled for Wednesdays at 3 p.m. In <a href="https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/april-15th-virtual-press-conference">this week's press conference</a>, we answered questions about grading, devices, special education, summer school and more. </p>

<p><strong>It's Tornado and Severe Weather Awareness Week in Wisconsin</strong></p>

<p>Severe weather can be a scary topic for many, especially in a time of already heightened anxiety about safety, but it's important to think and plan ahead for severe weather and to do so in a calm, reassuring way. It's comforting for kids to know that in an emergency, your family has a plan. (Here are some tips on <a href="https://www.brighthorizons.com/family-resources/talking-to-children-about-severe-weather" target="_blank">talking to children about severe weather</a>.)</p>

<p>While the state has canceled the tornado drill originally scheduled for this week, we are encouraged to spend some time talking with children about how to prepare for and what to do in extreme weather. </p>

<p>There are lots of free resources online to support educators and families in teaching children about severe weather - most of them in English only, with some exceptions. </p>

<p>We wanted to share some of our favorites here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ready.gov/kids" target="_blank">Ready.gov/kids</a> has games, tips and tools for kids, teens, families and educators, including some resources in Spanish and other languages (not Hmong). </p>

<p>FEMA's YouTube channel features a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LviZ4pZrqu8" target="_blank">variety of videos</a> for younger kids on severe weather, making a family communications plan and emergency kit and other topics. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.weather.gov/wrn/spring-safety" target="_blank">Weather.gov/wrn/spring-safety</a> has a bunch of information, like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=NNrb0hI5JD4&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">video on thunderstorm types</a>, for all ages on tornadoes and other springtime weather hazards. </p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has created <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readywrigley/books.htm" target="_blank">Ready Wrigley PDF activity books in English and Spanish</a> to help kids understand types of extreme weather and to help children learn the importance of being prepared.</p>

<p>Dane County Emergency Management offers advice in <a href="https://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/PDF/EMS/HouseholdEmergencyPlanGuide.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a> for creating a <a href="https://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/PDF/EMS/HouseholdEmergencyPlanTemplate.pdf" target="_blank">family emergency plan</a>. You can also <a href="https://em.countyofdane.com/emergency-alerts" target="_blank">sign up to receive emergency notifications</a> via text or email to be alerted to potentially life-threatening and public safety emergencies in Dane County at </p>

<p>We'd love to share any photos this week of you and your family learning about and preparing for severe weather, whether you're reading a book together, creating an emergency kit, watching a video together or coloring a picture.

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content">
<p dir="ltr">Dear Families, </p>

<p dir="ltr">As you’ve likely seen in the news by now, today Governor Evers has ordered all public and private K-12 schools to remain closed for the rest of the school year. He also directed the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to extend the Safer at Home order until 8 a.m. on Tuesday, May 26, or until a superseding order is issued. You can read the order <a href="https://secure-web.cisco.com/1vywoGKd6chiRl8M_N4LZ5kF47NMWj9Jkel4Tw_88TTLLRM1jZBFNLso2cOU61PiMqoN7ADTX3jeIBbaFsXeJIA-_VlRgu5kA16oQyFb04yaIa9ZrFkzeuyQQ6of-pXLDVCQ33dXdBcz5UkPMpKNFEpCBfQdBHjdAnHVC3fYdTchj2GN0LaMTKYhHw4UEuafysbAjRtHoeNPPgPrnivjHNgoOcQbkZssSrS2BbZLAT_1rF5mXXrKzV7yV8fxRWnWvEOSYUw1yEUMv5M25upCruw/https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDA0MTYuMjAyNTE4OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NvbnRlbnQuZ292ZGVsaXZlcnkuY29tL2F0dGFjaG1lbnRzL1dJR09WLzIwMjAvMDQvMTYvZmlsZV9hdHRhY2htZW50cy8xNDI4OTk1L0VNTzI4LVNhZmVyQXRIb21lLnBkZiJ9.qWMY5c_I0ekahdwfOefYoUIe1kYnmKJeh4NkQAvW3OI%2Fbr%2F77512112405-l" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The Governor’s decision  is in the best interests of our students, families and staff. I also recognize that it is very sad news for our school communities. My heart aches for students and staff who will not be together to finish out the school year, in particular our graduating class and those transitioning to middle or high school. Our senior class has already had to sacrifice a lot, and their resiliency and focus is something I will always appreciate and never forget.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While we have room to improve, not only as a school district but as a community, Virtual Learning is getting stronger every day. We know that 24,000 students are successfully accessing the internet and we are working hard to ensure that this is the case for every single student. Although not the preferred method for all students, MMSD Virtual Learning is becoming more robust and we will continue to expand and grow our capabilities to provide meaningful learning for every student from home.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We know that as a result of this announcement, there will be many questions, and I remain committed to communicating decisions and information to you as soon as I can. Given this unprecedented time, we have started holding virtual press conferences each week. This is an opportunity for reporters to ask questions of the school board and administration, and in the process, many questions that families have are addressed during this time. You can watch the conferences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiq4baXViPcY1gP8ddhJWOA/">live on this channel</a>. They are scheduled for Wednesdays at 3 p.m. You can find this week’s press conference here. (We are currently working on a solution to have these live-interpreted and closed-captioned.)</p>

<p dir="ltr">In closing, I want to let you know that you’ll receive a Family Newsletter on Friday with more information on a variety of topics. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><br>
Until then, take good care of yourselves, </p>

<p dir="ltr">Jane Belmore,<br>
Interim Superintendent</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content">
<p>We are committed to supporting all students in their learning throughout this school closure. We know that reporting on student progress is an important part of the partnership between families and schools. We are also aware that changes to grading have lasting impacts on students’ learning experiences. When we return to school buildings, our staff will work together to reassess student needs, and ensure students have the skills to succeed in next-level coursework. </p>

<p>We have developed the grading guidance below with the following goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain flexibility for teachers and students</li>
	<li>Minimize disruption for students </li>
	<li>Ensuring grades and assignments should only benefit students and not negatively affect their grades during this time</li>
	<li>Provide families and students accurate feedback about students’ progress</li>
	<li>Support all students through this emotionally challenging time  </li>
	<li>Consider the complex needs of all students, while supporting academic progress<br>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4K-5</strong></p>

<p>Traditional 3rd quarter conferences will not occur for elementary.  Staff will check in weekly with families. End of year report cards will be a narrative summary of progress in key areas. Additional information regarding report cards will be forthcoming. </p>

<p><strong>Middle School</strong></p>

<p>Middle School Quarter 3 and final report cards will both reflect the following changes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Students have the opportunity to complete assignments and improve existing grades.</li>
	<li>Students will not receive zeros. Unfinished or missing assignments in Quarters 3 and 4 will not count negatively toward a student’s grades.</li>
	<li>Student grades will not drop lower than they were on March 13th - grades can only be improved.</li>
	<li>Possible grades include: 4, 3, 2, continuing progress (CP) and N/A (for standards not taught).  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High School</strong></p>

<p>MMSD will be implementing a pass/no pass system for final second semester grades for all high school courses.  We recognize that there are no perfect options for addressing grading, because the current situation is far from ideal. </p>

<p>This decision aligns with our overall goals for high school grading that include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing teachers and students with maximum flexibility</li>
	<li>Ensuring there is no disruption to student GPAs and/or credit attainment</li>
	<li>Collecting evidence of student learning through progress monitoring and feedback  </li>
	<li>Supporting all students through this emotionally challenging time</li>
	<li>Ensuring grades should only benefit students from March 13th until the end of the school year</li>
</ul>
<p>Pass/no pass will freeze GPA as it stands after the first semester and will not impact a student’s cumulative grade point average (GPA).   Definitions of Pass/No Pass are listed below:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><strong>Pass </strong> - Student has met minimum requirements for content standards.  A grade of D (59.5%)- or higher is passing. </p>

<p class="rteindent1"><strong>No Pass</strong>  - Student has not met minimum requirements for content standards. Every effort has been made to ensure that students received feedback and multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery of standards.  Students will receive a No Pass (NP) for the course(s)</p>

<p>Teachers will continue to assign work and record the scores in the Infinite Campus (IC) gradebook. As assignments are completed and graded by teachers, students and families will be able to see grades in IC. These grades provide feedback regarding student performance on Virtual learning assignments. Please note, there will be no final exams for courses this year.  </p>

<p>We recognize that there are still some unknowns during this unprecedented time. Please know we are protective of the future post high school plans of our students. College admissions offices have been clear that they will be understanding of the various ways high schools will be approaching grading during these last two quarters.  </p>

<p>MMSD will provide letter grades when requested by a third party (examples: academic scholarship, post-secondary admission needs, NCAA athletic eligibility, etc). More details and processes will be forthcoming.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content">
<h2>Exploring plans for mailing offline instructional packets, by request, in the works (more to come)</h2>

<p>We are working on a plan to ensure every student without access to the internet still has the resources they need to stay engaged and continue learning during school closures. This may entail families signing up to receive additional instructional packets in the mail. We are working through details and will have more information for you on this next week, please stay tuned.</p>

<h2>Seriously, practice social distancing - MMSD playgrounds, athletic fields and courts closed </h2>

<p>The headline really says it all. But it bears repeating: all MMSD playgrounds, athletic fields and courts are closed. No one - children or adults - should be using these spaces. We are working on increasing the visibility of signage indicating this. <br>
 <br>
Public Health Madison &amp; Dane County has requested that we reiterate the importance of physical distancing to our families and staff. They shared this message: "We know these are tough times, and that having your kids get together with other kids brings a sense of comfort (and gives you a break too)! However, it's extremely important that you and your family maintain physical distance from other people who live outside of your home. Do not host play dates, meet up at the park or let your children hang out with their friends during the day, evening or on the weekends." </p>

<h2>AP Testing</h2>

<p>Students in advanced placement courses should have received a letter earlier this week, detailing the plan for AP exams, which will be administered online. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dH9GuferP4j8hgAcI_6HDScdpD-G-I79/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>

<h2>Huegel students share their virtual learning excitement</h2>

<h2>Family Art Activities by MSCR</h2>

<h2>Sharing food access resources from Public Health</h2>

<p>From Madison &amp; Dane County Public Health:  "COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed the face of food access in Madison and Dane County. There are new challenges for individuals who historically have had low access to food. There are also emerging challenges for the broader community as citizens grapple with Governor Evers's Safer at Home order.<br>
 <br>
Individuals with limited or no income can dial 2-1-1 from any phone to identify the nearby emergency food options. Most food pantries in Dane County have now switched to curbside or drive-thru pickup to minimize points of contact between volunteers, staff, and shoppers."</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom videoconferencing                             </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">As we do our best to support students and families, we are using a variety of methods to facilitate education and continue to develop relationships with our families.  We are, whenever possible, using many of the same online tools we employ in face-to-face schooling. However, we need to utilize these tools in new ways and add tools we didn’t need before COVID-19.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">During this time, we are offering the opportunity for students to video conference with classroom teachers for direct instruction through Zoom. We understand that there have been some concerns over Zoom’s privacy and security, and want to update you on what we are doing to protect our students, which is our top priority. </p>

<p>Teachers have been instructed to utilize one or more of the following features that will allow them to secure their Zoom room:</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Lock Zoom rooms once they start the class to prohibit others from joining. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Control the screen sharing settings with the room. Limit who can share anything and when sharing can take place.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Enable the waiting room, to determine who is allowed in the room.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Disable the chat feature, within the teacher’s room, if needed to prevent unwarranted conversations that might become a distraction for students.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Monitor who is in the room, prior to starting, and remove those not familiar to the teacher.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Do not allow users to join a room prior to the teacher. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Require a password for access to the room. </p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>If you have continued concern and DO NOT want your child to participate in Zoom video conferencing, please complete this <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/GMaQqcxS20EvmGOrGK682w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgb3KoP0RjaHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZm9ybXMvZC9lLzFGQUlwUUxTYzdsZ0RIVGhCRzlIa3BLNy13NjJGbEoyRWZkczhtRDhXS2xUbXh0S3V4LXN3STZRL3ZpZXdmb3JtVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAACg_jl7_bsxAUhtlbG1lcmZlbGRAbWFkaXNvbi5rMTIud2kudXNYBAAAAAE~&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586545233892000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMnxMwW-qNH_qAJycG1xUffMFq5g" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/GMaQqcxS20EvmGOrGK682w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgb3KoP0RjaHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZm9ybXMvZC9lLzFGQUlwUUxTYzdsZ0RIVGhCRzlIa3BLNy13NjJGbEoyRWZkczhtRDhXS2xUbXh0S3V4LXN3STZRL3ZpZXdmb3JtVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAACg_jl7_bsxAUhtlbG1lcmZlbGRAbWFkaXNvbi5rMTIud2kudXNYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">opt-out form</a> by 3:30 p.m. on April 15.</strong></p>

<p>I also wanted to share these additional clarifications: </p>

<ul>
<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Students should not create nor be asked to create accounts. In order to enforce this, all district-issued devices have blocked access to the account creation page.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Teachers will directly invite students to a video conference through a unique URL. No additional login is required of the student. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Students/families should not share the URL that the teacher has provided to students. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Since students cannot create accounts with the MMSD devices, they cannot invite other students or teachers to a Zoom meeting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Teachers have the opportunity to screen share, however, teachers will not record any lessons while students are in the Zoom room.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">It will be the responsibility of the teacher to end the meeting to ensure that students do not have access to the room once the lesson or office hour(s) is over.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Teachers managing the Zoom room will manage audio and video for all students. The default for Zoom is that participants will not show their videos. However, please know students can participate through video if the teacher enables this option. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">Your child(ren)'s information is confidential, but in a digital format, where small group instruction may occur, others will have access to their image and work product. For example, a student might share a document with others during a video session.  </p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Please feel free to reach out to your child(ren)’s class teacher or principal if you need additional information. </p>

<h2>Welcome back, students!</h2>

<p>We hope you and your student are looking forward to the second "first day" of school on Monday.</p>

<p>Remember that next week will be all about connecting with teachers, building community and getting used to new routines, technology and software. We are easing into virtual learning and not jumping right into instruction. Next week your teachers will let you know when they will be holding virtual "office hours" and telling you how to best contact them with questions and concerns.</p>

<h2>Wondering what we're expecting of students? </h2>

<p>Sisters Alma and Amelia <a href="https://youtu.be/jmXG5TPThAY">made a video</a> to explain what we expect from students. (We'll get to family and teacher expectations in a bit.)</p>

<h2>Virtual learning expectations for students</h2>

<h3>What online learning platform will your student use? </h3>

<p>Kindergarten-4th grade students will use Seesaw or Google Classroom for their daily learning engagements. Your teacher will let you know. </p>

<p>Grades 5-12 will use Google Classroom. </p>

<p>Students will use Zoom to participate in video conferences with teachers and classes each day. </p>

<h3>First-time Zoom user? </h3>

<p>It's OK! We have all the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hkurUEehlPb9H9ZYpQky6OpbyqslWuzRx5aP22XoqlI/edit?usp=sharing">tips you need</a> to make your first virtual meeting a success. </p>

 <br><a href="https://tinyurl.com/MMSDZoomStudents">MMSD Zoom Support Document for STUDENTS</a></p>

<h3>Need help getting into Google Classroom? </h3>

<p>We've heard that some students who are using family-owned devices are <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/coronavirus-google-classroom-chromebook-parental-controls/" target="_blank">having trouble accessing Google Classroom</a>. Parents/guardians, Google has provided <a href="https://support.google.com/families/answer/7685480?hl=en" target="_blank">step-by-step instructions</a> if you are experiencing this issue. If you continue to have trouble, we'll make sure you know who to reach out to next week to help you troubleshoot.</p>

<h2>Teachers take attendance once a week on Friday before 4pm</h2>

<p>Students will be considered in attendance if...</p>

<ul>
<li>They submit an assignment at any time during the week or participate in virtual class gatherings during the week.  </li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>The student (or student's family, especially for younger grades) is in touch with the teacher at some point throughout the week. This contact includes email, phone, or attending either a virtual lesson or teacher's office hours. </li>
</ul>
<h2>How many hours are students supposed to learn virtually?</h2>

<p>4K*:    1.0 - 1.5 hours daily<br>
K-2:    1.5 -2.0 hours daily <br>
3-5:     2.0-2.5 hours daily <br>
6-12:   3.0 hours daily</p>

<p>It is important to note that students should not be in front of technology for the entire time. Students should have a balance between online activities and activities outside of technology.</p>

<p>*<a href="https://earlyed.madison.k12.wi.us/4kearly-childhood-virtual-learning">Find daily learning plans and other resources for 4K / Early Childhood students and families here</a>. </p>

<h3>Are there specific hours of the day that students are expected to be online for school? </h3>

<p>Work to create a schedule that works for your family. Ideally some of this time will overlap when teachers are available for additional support. </p>

<h2>8 tips for learning virtually  </h2>

<p><a href="https://curriculum.madison.k12.wi.us/files/curriculum/uploads/online-learning/virtuallearningtips.pdf">This graphic offers eight helpful tips</a> for students and families to not only survive virtual learning, but thrive at it! They include advice for limiting distractions, creating a quiet learning space, taking breaks, connecting with friends virtually, balancing screen time, keeping in touch with other parents and guardians, maintaining a schedule and scheduling time for fun. </p>

<h2>Staying in contact with your child's teacher(s)</h2>

<p>If you or your student needs help understanding an assignment, reach out to the teacher with any questions you have. Teachers should let you know the best way to contact them. It might be email, Zoom or phone. </p>

<h2>We know many of you have questions about high school grading</h2>

<p>Please know that we are actively problem-solving around high school grading and trying to sort out the many complexities that exist. The state Department of Public Instruction recently published grading guidance, which we will use in our decision-making. We want to ensure that students are not penalized because of school closures. This is not a simple or an easy decision. Thank you for your patience. We will share information when we know more. </p>

<h2>Need help with a digital device or software issue?</h2>

<p>If you have not been in contact with your school about a device your student needs or if your student has any hardware issues (charging trouble, keyboard issue, broken screen and so on) or software issues (accessing instructional websites or applications or trouble logging into to their Chromebook), please go to our new <a href="https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/wifi-chromebooks">Tech Support page</a> and select your child's school from the drop-down menu. </p>

<p>You will be prompted to send an email to your school's Library &amp; Technology Media Specialist (LMTS), who will work with you and tech services, beginning on Monday, to help solve your issue. </p>

<p>Starting Tuesday, April 7, we will also have a tech support phone number for you to call if you are not able to send an email. The phone number will be listed at the page linked above. </p>

<h2>Combat coronavirus-related bullying, racism</h2>

<p>Incidents of coronavirus-related xenophobia and racism, including physical attacks, are on the rise. The following are just a few resources that address this topic. We encourage you to review them and have developmentally appropriate conversations with your child about the serious consequences of bullying and racism. </p>

<p>It is important to avoid assumptions or stereotypes about who you think might be sick. Viruses cannot target people from specific populations, ethnicities, or racial backgrounds. A person's race does not make them more or less likely to be sick or to get sick.</p>

<h2>Virtual learning expectations for families and teachers </h2>

<p>You have a very important role to play in your child's transition to virtual learning. Just as students have expectations to fulfill as we embark on this journey together, families and teachers do too. </p>

<p>Families will...</p>

<ul>
<li>Communicate with their child's teacher if they have questions about virtual learning. </li>
	<li>Do their best to establish a place for learning at home that minimizes distractions.</li>
	<li>Set realistic goals for themselves and their child(ren). </li>
	<li>Work to establish a routine for learning at home while also being flexible when needed.  </li>
	<li>Remind their child to check in with their teacher if they have concerns or need support.</li>
	<li>Communicate with their child’s teacher if they have questions or if their child is sick or can’t participate in virtual learning.</li>
	<li>Encourage their child to take frequent breaks and engage in non-school related activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a list of the expectations for teachers as well, on our new virtual learning website, <a href="https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/virtual-learning">mmsd.org/virtual-learning</a>.</p>

<h2>See you next week!</h2>

<p>Again, we are here for you as we enter this new way of learning together. Next week we are easing into virtual learning and not jumping right into instruction. The week will be all about connecting with teachers, building community and getting used to new routines, technology and software. Rest up this weekend, and we look forward to connecting with you and your student on Monday.</p>

<p>Dear Families,</p>

<p>I hope you are staying well and finding creative ways to connect with friends and family using social media and physical distance guidelines. As we are getting glimpses of spring, I also hope you get some time outside and that you remain safe and healthy.</p>

<p>I want you to know that we are here for you as we enter this new way of learning together. We know that virtual learning comes with challenges, and we're ready to face them along with you and your children with patience, compassion and out-of-the-box thinking. So thank you in advance for your partnership.</p>

<p>As difficult as this time has been, I've seen so many inspiring and touching acts of kindness and love for neighbors and strangers alike. As we practice social distancing, in some ways I feel we've been brought a little closer together as an #MMSDFamily.</p>

<p>This week our educators jumped right in to some pretty substantial professional learning from home, all while juggling their own personal demands, and I could not be prouder. At the same time our teachers and leaders are preparing for instruction, many more staff are working behind the scenes to secure our buildings, distribute meals and prepare digital devices to be delivered. This is truly an all-hands-on-deck, team effort, and I want to recognize our staff for that.</p>

<p><strong>So, for next week: </strong>I know many of you are wondering about expectations, schedule, devices, attendance, grading, and other need-to-know information for next week. This Friday we'll be launching our new Virtual Learning website for students and families. We'll be sending another email at that time with all of these details so that you and your student go into Monday prepared. Please do review the update below about devices. This is an incredibly complex, multi-step process, and we'll have about 6,000 devices out for delivery tomorrow, with another big batch Friday. Our Technology Services department has done a great job of coming up with incredibly innovative solutions to the challenges of confirming needs and addresses with families and delivering the devices under the state's #SaferAtHome orders.</p>

<p>So thank you for your patience. Before I reach back out on Friday with details on virtual learning, here are some updates for this week.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here are some updates for this week.</p>

<p>Be well,</p>

<p>Jane Belmore, Interim Superintendent</p>

<p>P.S. We know this is a tough time for many families, financially. The Foundation for Madison's Public Schools has established two emergency relief funds. If you are in a position to donate, you can find that info toward the end of this newsletter.</p>

<h2>If your child does not have a device by Monday, it's OK.</h2>

<p>MMSD is teaming up with United Parcel Service (UPS) to have packaged devices delivered to every student who needs them. <strong>If you are concerned about your child having a device, know that this week schools are reaching out individually to any family who has not confirmed their device need and mailing address. Please be on the lookout for a phone call, text, or email from your school. If your student hasn't received what they need - whether it's a device, a power cord or other piece of hardware - by Monday, it's OK.</strong> Next week we are easing into virtual learning and not jumping right into instruction. We have time to work this out. And please know that if you have multiple students who need a device, they may arrive on different days. Early next week we will also be notifying you how you can submit a ticket for any devices needing repair or other issues and questions that come up around technology. </p>

<h2>Sample daily routine</h2>

<p><a href="https://curriculum.madison.k12.wi.us/files/curriculum/uploads/online-learning/finaldailyvirtualschedule.jpg">This is a very high-level example</a> of what your student's day should look like, starting next week. Again, more details will be coming on Friday and as your student begins to work with their teacher.</p>

<h2>Enrichment resources</h2>

<p><strong>PBS Wisconsin At-Home Learning Broadcasts on The Wisconsin Channel</strong><br>
PBS Wisconsin, in partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and Milwaukee PBS, now has at-home learning programming for students and families, broadcasting a new weekday television schedule of programming with digital resources that connect to Wisconsin's state academic standards.<br>
 <br>
The special broadcast schedule will also be available to stream online at <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/at-home-learning/">pbswisconsin.org/at-home-learning</a>. That website also features corresponding free digital content for at-home learning and support for teachers navigating this new learning landscape.</p>

<p>Dear Families, </p>

<p>I hope you are finding spaces of nourishment and rest as our modified spring break comes to a close. As each of us, individually and in community, are working to find our way in rapidly changing conditions, I wanted to provide you with a very important update regarding the distribution of devices for those students who need them for our Virtual Learning roll out.  </p>

<p>As many of you are aware, the district has struggled over the last couple weeks to develop a safe plan for distribution of devices to students who need them. Public health guidelines and orders from Governor Ever’s office in response to Coronavirus has forced the district to scuttle previous on-site distribution plans to adhere to rapidly expanding social distancing directives.   </p>

<p>To overcome this unique challenge, MMSD is teaming up with United Parcel Service (UPS) to have packaged devices delivered to every student who needs them.  The devices are an important component for students as MMSD transitions to Virtual Learning set to launch April 6.</p>

<p>To make this happen, UPS is providing significantly reduced pricing to MMSD for boxes, packaging materials, insurance, and verified delivery. </p>

<p>Our plan is to start shipping devices by Wednesday so that all students have them by the end of next week.  Deliveries will require a “sign off” meaning the UPS driver will need to verify a person received the device at each household. This will be done following social distancing guidelines by using simple visual verification that the device was received by the appropriate family.</p>

<p>In preparation, over the next couple of days MMSD will be verifying mailing addresses for families who indicated they need a device to ensure delivery accuracy, as some addresses may be different from a typical household address. Additionally, the district is working with the City of Madison to identify school-age children who may be residing with their families at area hotels to ensure these students have the resources they need to continue learning.</p>

<p><strong>If you have previously indicated that your child is in need of a device, please be on the lookout for an MMSD survey to verify your need and your address so that we can be sure you receive one.</strong>  Please know that we will make every effort possible to determine addresses for those families that did not receive or return surveys. </p>

<p>From the beginning of this crisis, our focus has been the safety and well-being of our students, families and staff and we believe this to be the safest alternative to getting these important devices into our students hands so that every student has the resources to continue learning. </p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>Jane Belmore<br>
Interim Superintendent </p>

<p>Dear MMSD Families,</p>

<p>I hope this email finds you well. As we gear up to begin professional development with staff next week on providing virtual learning to our students, I wanted to continue to provide updates on topics I know are important to you.</p>

<p><strong>Device distribution</strong></p>

<p>We are on track to tentatively be handing out Chromebooks to families next Thursday (elementary schools) and Friday (middle and high schools). As plans are finalized, I will be reaching out with more details. If you have had trouble accessing the survey, know that we are not turning any students away. If you request a Chromebook for your student, we will be following up through a variety of strategies to make sure that all of our students have access to a device and can connect to the internet. However, if you did receive the link to the survey but haven’t completed it, please do so. It gives us a baseline idea of how many devices we need to have prepared to distribute next week.</p>

<p><strong>MMSD playgrounds are closed</strong></p>

<p>Playgrounds on MMSD school property are closed. Under Governor Evers’ “Safer At Home” order, playgrounds are off limits. If you have questions, please review <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/e4meWEjePHwm8S-zW6qaBA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgXm12P0RSaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHVibGljaGVhbHRobWRjLmNvbS9kb2N1bWVudHMvU2FmZXIlMjBhdCUyMEhvbWUlMjAxMDElMjAyMDIwLTAzLTI1LnBkZlcHc2Nob29sbUIKAAD2OX1edCdH2VIZYm1hY2tleUBtYWRpc29uLmsxMi53aS51c1gEAAAAAQ~~">Madison &amp; Dane County Public Health’s “Safer At Home” 101 poster</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Communicating with teachers and principals</strong></p>

<p>If you urgently need to contact your school, all <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/1XW11f6bi6iebwE8PMJ77g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgXm12P0RnaHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vc3ByZWFkc2hlZXRzL2QvMUVjYmstRWpRVWNQeG1DcGFiQXJBcTYtU19wd3BBaDJyVWItV1lTNFU4bmMvZWRpdCNnaWQ9MTA5MjUyMjAzOFcHc2Nob29sbUIKAAD2OX1edCdH2VIZYm1hY2tleUBtYWRpc29uLmsxMi53aS51c1gEAAAAAQ~~">principal email addresses are posted here</a> and on <a href="http://mmsd.org/">mmsd.org</a>. Your child’s teachers may be reaching out to you as well via email, in particular once virtual learning begins. Please check your email on a regular basis, if possible, so you don’t miss important messages. Given these extraordinary circumstances, we are temporarily allowing staff to reach out to families via their personal cell phones. If you receive phone calls from numbers you do not recognize, please know that it may be a teacher calling.</p>

<p><strong>We are in this together</strong></p>

<p>None of us signed up for this, but we are going to get through it together. Virtual learning is causing us to approach teaching and learning in new and creative ways. Most importantly, we want our students to feel supported and positive about their learning. We want to set them up for success, and to do so we need to provide compassion, patience, and grace through this process as we learn together. I would ask the same for our teachers, who are working diligently to become proficient very quickly with new ways of teaching with technology.</p>

<p>In partnership,</p>
