			<p>Dear Monroe School District elementary school families,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">Governor Inslee’s decision last week that we will not be returning to our classrooms this school year has been challenging news to process for all of us -- students, families, and staff. Please know that while in-person learning is not an option right now, we are committed to keeping students and families engaged in learning. </p>

<p dir="ltr">As we return from Spring Break, we will continue our learning through our <strong><a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus/educational-resources/elementary-resources">student engagement menus</a></strong> and increasing opportunities to learn and meet virtually. <strong>Offline learning resources will continue to be printed and available during lunch service at all elementary schools starting each Tuesday</strong>. As a reminder, when using the student engagement menus, it is not necessary to do everything listed for each subject area each day. There is likely too much content for this to even be possible. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Our staff is working quickly to learn more about best practices around online student learning. Sometime this week, you will hear from your child’s teacher with an opportunity for your child to learn and/or connect virtually. We will continue developing and expanding our continuous learning program to carry us through the scheduled end of school on June 19th.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As we move forward, we strongly suggest that you work with your children to build a daily learning schedule and routine that resembles a school day. This can help bring continuity to our students in order to help their personal well-being and stress management during this time. You can see a sample completed daily schedule here: <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slVBf2N8HjkUIKBX9QJF8ZhHvFv9yDQ0eWGpj0yyEkI/edit">English</a></strong> / <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I6S2AAxUmHE2hVuV58BV6rF3nhtI_cGn9-WfRbDJTPw/edit?usp=sharing">Spanish</a></strong>. For a blank schedule to use with your child, use this link: <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PrchtscbgHDwwGY3upFCAlw8fmwSnXvS1tz5GN2WOJ8/edit?usp=sharing">English</a></strong> / <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1APkYCdCRnOZb5JLxiwu4peyRImhcO71GSkG9iDJk9do/edit?usp=sharing">Spanish</a></strong>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We know that this will be a new experience for everyone, and we are committed to moving forward in a supportive way for all. We also see this as a chance for us to partner with parents and guardians as you will continue to play a key role in helping your children stay focused and deepen their learning. </p>

<p dir="ltr">If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Warmly,</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Elementary Principal Team</p>

<p dir="ltr">Greetings Hidden River and Park Place Middle School Families,</p>

<p dir="ltr">We hope this letter finds you all safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. As we head into the week of spring break, we wanted to send out a letter to our middle school families, recapping the work our middle school staff has accomplished over the last 2 weeks and setting the stage for what school will look like starting Monday, April 13th.  </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Our Work Since March 13th</strong><br>
When school ended on March 12th, staff across the district shifted quickly into our new reality: figuring out how we are going to meet the needs of students and families without that daily connection we are used to with students in the buildings each day. As guided by our state and county leaders, our main task the first week was to gather information from families around the basic needs that were emerging in our community, specifically around nutrition, child care, and technology access for families. Throughout last week, middle school staff worked diligently to connect with our students remotely and created enrichment learning activities and opportunities that we sent out to all of our middle school students. These are instructional lessons they can continue to work on through spring break.   </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Remote Learning Starting April 13th</strong><br>
This week we have been working with our staff and leadership teams to move from providing enrichment learning activities and opportunities to delivering our curriculum remotely, starting Monday April 13th. In planning for this remote learning structure, we’ve kept some guiding principles of student engagement at the forefront of our decision making. We’ve asked teams to focus strictly on the most essential standards and skills and to generate lessons that are creativite, flexible, and allow for student choice. The reality is that this learning will look different than what we are used to when students are physically present in our schools and in order to keep students engaged and interested at home, our middle school staff has worked diligently to build lessons and learning experiences with these guiding principles of engagement in mind.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Middle School Remote Learning Schedule</strong><br>
Starting Monday, April 13th, students will be back on a consistent daily schedule for school. In navigating these unprecedented set of circumstances, it’s important for students to keep a predictable daily routine now more than ever. The following are some key highlights and expectations for the Middle School Remote Learning Schedules, which are also attached and linked here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVfubLCszlv_zngW6zIPVCxb7ca15-Wg_hkXhfRx9SQ/edit">PPM Schedule</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EipLjkg0tRQ0562p7kZarTOn1t88l8l7PlfFenF-zSY/edit">HRM Schedule</a></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Each day the student day will start at 9:00 am.  For students that are unable to attend class as scheduled, teachers will post paper copies of the learning materials and resources that families can access so students can continue their learning at another time of the day.  </p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Students should begin their day by checking their school e-mail and preparing to connect with their teachers. Students should end their day by checking their school email, looking ahead to the next day, and making note of assignments they need to be working on.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">On Mondays and Wednesdays, teachers will be providing live and interactive instruction during the three identified academic block periods.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">On Tuesday and Thursday during normal class time, teachers will be connecting with smaller groups of students during their office hours. It is during these times that students can also be asking questions of their teachers, connecting with other students in their class remotely, and receiving help as needed.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Friday will be dedicated to Puma Time (for PPM students) and Hawk Time (for HRM students). During Puma and Hawk Time, students will be either receiving extra instruction and support from the learning that week or they will be working on extension activities if they don’t need that extra support.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">For Hidden River students only, since we have an “A day, B day” schedule, we will rotate each week being either an “A week” or a “B week”.  April 13th will be an “A week”, so students should attend their “A day” classes for that week.  </p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Technology Needs</strong><br>
Our school district is currently working on ensuring that all students in Monroe have access to a Chromebook at home during this closure as well as resources to access low-cost or free internet service providers as needed, prior to Monday, April 13th.  If you have a concern regarding the technology needs for accessing these learning opportunities, please contact your student’s counselor.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Term 3 Grades and Grading During Remote Learning</strong><br>
We will not be providing progress reports for Term 3 grades this semester. Quarterly grades are intended to communicate progress to students and families and with the closure of our schools in the middle of the term, the reporting of that progress is incomplete. Moving forward, while we are still working to figure out how students will be graded during this school closure, our most important goal is that students engage with the activities, projects and learning experiences.  Teachers will be providing feedback to students around their learning each week and students should focus on that feedback as a way to improve and grow in this remote learning structure. As we get more guidance from OSPI, we will let you know what the expectations for grading will be. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Attendance</strong><br>
Currently we have yet to determine how we will be tracking student attendance on a daily basis during the scheduled class time, but teachers will be taking note of students who are absent during learning so that they can follow up with these students to make sure they receive what they need for the week. One of our biggest concerns is students not connecting at all. For students that cannot attend class as scheduled, teachers will post paper copies of the learning materials and resources that families can access so students can continue their learning. If your child has difficulty accessing either of these learning opportunities, please notify a teacher, counselor, or building administrator.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Ongoing Support for Students and Families</strong><br>
Throughout this school closure a real concern for all of us are the social and emotional needs for both our students and families. One of the most critical pieces of our weekly work is checking in with students individually around their learning. But more importantly, these check-ins are also to identify needs emerging with students and families and to continue that sense of connection that we are hoping students feel with their teachers and their school. In addition to the remote learning structure and connections around learning, students should expect an intentional and personalized check in from a staff member to start and end every week.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">We know that students and families may have additional questions or concerns, so please don’t hesitate to reach out to any middle school staff member as needed. We so appreciate our middle school parents and families and the grace and patience you have afforded us as we shift to a remote learning model. There will likely be kinks during the first couple of weeks and small issues we need to solve, but we know that by working together we can pull this off successfully.  We truly appreciate all that you are doing at home to provide stability and reassurance for your students. We will make it through all of this, please know our middle school staff is excited and eager to get back into a normal school routine, and now more than ever we are fully committed to our mission of preparing students for the future that lies ahead of them. Go Pumas and Go Hawks!  <br>

			<p>Dear Monroe School District families,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">This afternoon, Governor Jay Inslee announced that as part of our state’s battle against COVID-19, traditional on-site learning will not resume for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. This is difficult news to process and we understand that this may be upsetting and disappointing for our students, families, and staff.  It also raises questions about what this means. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Rest assured, we have been preparing for this possibility. As we continue to roll out the technology for online learning (see the Chromebook check-out schedule <strong><a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/about/news/new-page/~post/chromebook-check-out-schedule-for-students-20200402">here</a></strong>), our staff is working quickly to learn more about best practices around online student learning. Subjects your students have been learning in-person will be moving to an online and distance teaching and learning platform. Moving forward, teachers will begin providing virtual lessons, assessing and providing feedback on student learning, and continuing to maintain connections with students and families. We know that some students will struggle with access to the internet (see local internet connection offers <strong><a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus/community-resources">here</a></strong>) so we will continue to ensure that learning is also available in hard copy. We will continue developing and expanding our distance learning program to carry us through the scheduled end of school in June. More information about the transition to distance learning will be shared later this week.</p>

<p dir="ltr">High school students will still be earning credits and our seniors who were on track to graduate will be able to complete their requirements toward graduation. We remain hopeful that we hold some type of ceremony to recognize our seniors and their accomplishments creatively, whether virtually, in small groups or other settings as permitted by the Governor’s order at that time. We’re evaluating a list of possibilities for graduation, depending on what will be allowed, and certainly welcome input and suggestions. Together, we can make all of our traditional school celebrations unique and memorable. </p>

<p dir="ltr">I have seen tremendous resilience and creativity as staff and families develop new ways to connect and find joy in the midst of this crisis. Our students need this from us now more than ever. Please know that we are truly in this together and I’m confident we can make sure that our students don’t just survive, they thrive. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Stay safe and stay healthy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr. Justin Blasko, Superintendent<br><em>Monroe School District</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Dear Monroe School District families, </p>

<p dir="ltr">Spring Break for Monroe School District is next week—Monday, April 6 through Friday, April 10. While it seems as if nothing is normal right now, we are honoring this predetermined date and asking the majority of our staff members to unplug and embrace this important break. We invite you to do the same with your families.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our meal service will continue for children during the break, Monday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at all elementary schools and on bus routes found <a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus/meals-for-students">here</a>. We are so appreciative of our staff members from nutrition services, transportation and throughout our district who make this essential service possible for our community.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Chromebook check-out process for our high school seniors, Sky Valley Indian Education students, Sky Valley Education Center students and students receiving services through Individual Education Plans (IEPs) went very well this week. Now as we look toward next week, we are preparing to check out Chromebooks to the rest of our students district-wide. As a reminder, we have enough Chromebooks for all of our registered students who may need one, but we will only be checking out Chromebooks to designated groups of students each day in order to minimize the number of individuals on campus at one time. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The Chromebook schedule for the week of April 6-10 is as follows:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Monday, April 6 and Tuesday, April 7 @ Monroe High School</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">All students who attend Chain Lake, Fryelands, or Salem Woods, plus all of their older siblings </p>

<ul dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li role="presentation">Students with last names that begin with A through F -- Monday, April 6th between 8:00 and 11:30 a.m.</li>

	<li role="presentation">Students with last names that begin with S through Z -- Tuesday, April 7th between Noon and 3:30 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Wednesday, April 8 @ Frank Wagner Elementary</strong></p>

<ul dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li role="presentation">Students with last names that begin with A through E -- 8:00 to 9:30 a.m.</li>
	<li role="presentation">Students with last names that begin with F through K -- 10:00 to 11:30 a.m.</li>
	<li role="presentation">Students with last names that begin with L through P -- Noon to 1:30 p.m.</li>
	<li role="presentation">Students with last names that begin with Q through Z -- 2:00 to 3:30 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">There will also be at least two "make-up" days during the week of April 13-17 for anyone who could not make it to their designated date and time. Further details regarding those dates and times will be forthcoming.</p>

<p dir="ltr">An adult must accompany any minor age student to check-out the Chromebook and you must provide proof that you have a student currently enrolled in the MSD. Students do not need to be present when you pick-up a Chromebook. Acceptable identification may include ONE of the following: the student’s unique Student ID Number, the student’s unique Alpha Key (for district network login), student ASB card, OR a parent or guardian’s Washington State Driver’s License or State ID Card.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Students who check out a Chromebook are expected to use district technology responsibly and must understand the appropriate and responsible use of the technology and district network resources. The district also expects that students will keep their devices safe, secure, and in good working order. It is expected that the Chromebook will be returned to the district/school, in the same condition it was received, reasonable wear and tear accepted. Failure to do so may result in a fine or fee.</p>

<p dir="ltr">By accepting the possession of a District Chromebook, the parents/guardians and student acknowledge and agree to the conditions found on our website, <strong><a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/about/news/new-page/~post/chromebook-check-out-schedule-for-students-20200402">here</a></strong>.</p>

			<p>Good Morning Families,</p>

<p>As we come to the end of this week, I wanted to send an update with regards to how the district is serving students who are served with disabilities.  I apologize as this is a more lengthy message but I thought you would appreciate more detail with regards to services that your children will be receiving.  In my meetings with teachers, I am hearing many exciting examples of students and families participating and many examples of learning that are already occurring.</p>

<p>When we return from Spring Break on April 13, you can expect to find an increased level of service and each of your case managers will be communicating the learning format options, activities and services your children will be receiving.  As I had mentioned in my previous communications we are continuing to receive guidance from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) and are building our services consistent with the guidance which most recent guidance dated March 24, 2020 states::</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">“Guidance dated March 21, 2020 from the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Office for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS)1 indicated that “there may be exceptional circumstances that could affect how a particular service is provided.” There is not an expectation that IEP services would be delivered exactly as the IEP states. This is a national emergency, and districts should be communicating with families and making decisions based on student need and how those services can be provided.”</p>

<p>With that said, each IEP team is building plans based on the individual needs and are making sure each service area (reading, writing, SLP, OT, etc... ) is being addressed.  However, the intensity and time provided for each service area may be different based on the student's need.  For students who have significant needs or need 1:1 adult support, the guidance on this topic stated:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">“There is no one way to provide services. Districts are encouraged to brainstorm ways to provide services to their students and how to individualize these services based on individual student need….Districts should make decisions individually based on student needs, and the focus should be on supporting students and their parents/caregivers in engaging in systems that promote safe behaviors in the home and community.”</p>

<p>In our planning, we are looking at creative ways of addressing each of your children’s individual needs.  </p>

<p>Finally,  we will be continuing to conduct IEP meetings through Zoom or conference calls.  This is your choice, and if you would prefer to wait for an in-person meeting, the IEP meeting will need to occur within the first 30 school days of school re-opening.  Evaluations may be occurring remotely as well depending on the type of evaluation and your school evaluation teams will communicate with you regarding these options.</p>

<p>We will continue to adjust services based on your feedback and what is working or not working for your children.  I hope you and your families enjoy a safe Spring Break and we look forward to getting to learning when we return.<meta charset="utf-8"></p>

			<p><meta charset="utf-8">Dear Monroe School District community,                              </p>

<p dir="ltr">We have received confirmation that staff who work at Fryelands Elementary and Maltby Elementary have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). The staff reported to work at both locations last week before showing symptoms of the illness. The other staff members who came in direct contact with the affected staff last week have been notified and are taking appropriate actions to deter the potential spread of this virus. In addition, the staff was in contact with students and other staff members during the week of March 9-12 when school was still in session. We are sharing this to let you know that our Fryelands and Maltby Elementary staff and students may have been exposed to the virus. It is our duty to uphold our staff members’ rights to privacy and, therefore, we will not share names, positions, or any other personally identifiable information beyond this notification.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Snohomish County Health District advises families and staff at all schools to assume, at some point, they have had contact with a confirmed case, whether at school or in the community. That’s why it is so important that everyone follow all social distancing and hygiene guidelines set by public health officials to keep themselves and those around them safe. Be sure to watch for <a href="https://www.snohd.org/DocumentCenter/View/3118/FAQ_coronavirus_03192020?bidId=">symptoms</a> and contact your primary care physician if needed.</p>

			<p><meta charset="utf-8">Dear Monroe School District elementary school families,</p>

<p dir="ltr">Welcome to Monroe School District’s K-5 <a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus/educational-resources/elementary-resources">student engagement framework.</a> Our staff has worked very hard to create meaningful learning engagement opportunities for our students, families, and community during this closure. The resources within the framework are broken down by both grade level and subject area. Each week there will be a new set of learning opportunities posted. <u>Offline resources will be printed and available during lunch service at each elementary starting on Tuesday</u>. We strongly suggest that you work with your children to build a daily learning schedule and routine that resembles a school day. Make sure that ELA (Reading/Writing) is a part of every day!</p>

<p dir="ltr">One of our primary goals during this time away from school is to keep students and families engaged around learning. We also see this as a chance for parents and guardians to play a key role in helping their children stay focused and deepen student understanding of some concepts. One strategy to use to keep your child engaged is to create a daily schedule. A schedule brings continuity to our students in order to help their personal well-being and stress management during this time that we know is filled with so many questions.</p>

<p dir="ltr">You can see a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PrchtscbgHDwwGY3upFCAlw8fmwSnXvS1tz5GN2WOJ8/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>sample daily schedule here</strong>.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">You can find the <strong><a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus/educational-resources/elementary-resources">educational resources here</a></strong>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>It is not necessary to do everything listed for each subject area each day. There is likely too much content for this to even be possible.</strong> Instead, we recommend that you utilize the schedule attached or develop your own plan for each day and week and make a commitment to setting up a learning plan for that you can adhere to. Our staff has attempted to include several high-interest activities in each area to keep students’ minds thinking, working and problem-solving. Make this fun and allow students to work in a place that is comfortable for them.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our tech hotline for support at 360-804-2680.</p>

			<p>Dear Monroe School District families,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">I would like to thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to work to adjust to our current circumstances amidst a very uncertain time. We know that the greatest strength of our educational system is that it is based on the power of the social interactions that make learning the most meaningful for our students. Our work every day in schools with students includes fostering teamwork, social skills, perseverance, and the ability to deepen learning through interactions.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now we are challenged to replicate learning in a way that comes as close to that setting as possible. Not only does this require the use of new tools and unfamiliar resources, it requires that our experienced educators reimagine the foundation and learning philosophy that they have developed and strengthened over time and in some cases, over the course of multiple decades.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) continues to provide us with evolving guidance, as they too are working to be as responsive as possible to an unpredictable and unmapped situation. The initial guidance that came as the school closures began was to do our best to provide all students with review materials to minimize the loss of learning while being especially mindful of equity. Our teams did that exceptionally well. Our Special Education teams, for example, met right away to think through the specific needs of students currently served through Individualized Education Plans. Teachers, specialists and administrators came together and developed options specific to the unique needs of students with disabilities. They deserve extensive acknowledgment for their fast actions and passionate approach to advocacy. Parallel to that, teams of teachers in every school came together to consider what tools they have and what needs exist, to respond to the immediate shift in school structures.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While we are not able to replicate the learning that happens every day when school is in session, we continue to gain traction on increasing the learning resources that our teachers and all of our staff will continue to support. We are very sensitive to the fact that each of our 6,200 students has a unique set of circumstances. There is an important balance to recognize, as there are many families who simply do not have the bandwidth or the logistics to make learning their highest priority, and we deeply understand that as the impacts of this crisis continue to increase physically, financially and emotionally. We also know that many families are seeking additional rigor and the structures that schools provide. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Moving forward, you can expect to see an increasing menu of learning options, including online learning options as well as hard copies of learning materials. Families can expect continued communication from teachers and principals as the learning resources become available. In addition, our technology department has been working hard to prepare thousands of Chromebooks (laptops) to be ready for student use at home. You will see the plan to roll these devices out very soon.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Among the greatest hurdles in front of us remains that of ensuring internet connectivity for all families. We have hundreds of students who do not have reliable service at home for various reasons. For some, it is due to living in areas without reception, some who have financial constraints, and some who use tools, such as a smartphone, for a hot spot that may not be available at all times. We are continuing to work out those logistics in an effort to provide equitable access to all of our students. If you currently do not have internet in your home, we have attached a letter with current offers available from internet providers that service our area. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Please know that the staff throughout Monroe School District miss your children and worry every day about doing our best to support you. We worry about the present and the future, and always have our students in the front of our attention as we try to create a response to a future that we cannot predict. We will continue to come at this with a positive attitude and the confidence that we, as a community, have the tools and ambition needed for successful outcomes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p dir="ltr">Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dr. Fredrika Smith<br><em>Superintendent</em></p>

			<p>Good afternoon Monroe School District families,</p>

<p>I wanted to give you an update for this week with some of the supports we are getting in place for families who have children served on IEPs.  We have been busy in our department over the past week and have made great strides on behalf of your children. I have met with our great teachers and specialists and we have created an online library of resources for you to access and utilize with your children.  You can find the resources on our district website and at this link: <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/hujkOHfmU_Fu7U1VIX8FxQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgXltJP0RbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ucm9lLndlZG5ldC5lZHUvZGVwYXJ0bWVudHMvaGVhbHRoLXNlcnZpY2VzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2VkdWNhdGlvbmFsLXJlc291cmNlc1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAADJJ31epXk2QFIbcGFyYXRvcmVkQG1vbnJvZS53ZWRuZXQuZWR1WAQAAAAB&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585351598607000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQ3sBb3WHfbWM2ZFifkQ1XrIpIWw" href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/hujkOHfmU_Fu7U1VIX8FxQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgXltJP0RbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9ucm9lLndlZG5ldC5lZHUvZGVwYXJ0bWVudHMvaGVhbHRoLXNlcnZpY2VzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2VkdWNhdGlvbmFsLXJlc291cmNlc1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAADJJ31epXk2QFIbcGFyYXRvcmVkQG1vbnJvZS53ZWRuZXQuZWR1WAQAAAAB" target="_blank">https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/<wbr></wbr>departments/health-services/<wbr></wbr>coronavirus/educational-<wbr></wbr>resources</a>.  There are materials for each special education program in multiple content areas.  Each family’s IEP case manager will be communicating with you regarding which resources are best suited for your child.  Additionally, please feel free to browse the resources in different program folders for additional ways to work with your child during the closure.</p>

<p>You can expect to be contacted by your student’s IEP case manager each week and they will be developing a support plan to help determine and track the educational opportunities selected for your child which are individualized for their specific areas of need.  We are continuing to receive updated guidance from the Office of Superintendent of Public Education (OSPI) and will be continuing to build supports and services that are in alignment with our state’s expectations.  </p>

<p>If your child needs a chromebook or has a need for internet service to access online materials and instruction, please let your IEP case manager and building principal know and we will make arrangements to get a device for you.</p>

<p>I am sure we will have updates and changes to our plan in the coming days and I will do my best to update you each week with the most updated information.  As always, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>

			<p>Dear Monroe School District community,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">We have received confirmation that a Frank Wagner Elementary student has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). The student was in attendance at Frank Wagner on Wednesday, March 18 and was home ill on Thursday, March 19. The student was tested for COVID-19 shortly thereafter and just received positive results. We are sharing this to let you know that because of this, our Frank Wagner staff and students may have been exposed to the virus. In addition, the student has a sibling who attends Monroe High School who has not shown any symptoms of the illness. It is our duty to uphold students’ rights to privacy and, therefore, we will not share student names, grade levels, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This is the first confirmed case of COVID-19 of a staff member or student in the Monroe School District that we are aware of. We are thankful that the student’s family shared this information with us. Now that schools are closed, Snohomish County Health District will no longer be notifying us of staff members, students or parents who test positive for COVID-19. They anticipate that many staff, students and parents will test positive over the coming weeks and this is why the Governor ordered all schools in Washington State to be closed through April 24.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Public Health advises families and staff at all schools to assume, at some point, they have had contact with a confirmed case, whether at school or in the community. That’s why it is so important that everyone follow all social distancing and hygiene guidelines set by the Snohomish Health District to keep themselves and those around them safe. Be sure to watch for <a href="https://www.snohd.org/DocumentCenter/View/3118/FAQ_coronavirus_03192020?bidId=">symptoms</a> and contact your primary care physician if needed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr. Fredrika Smith<br><em>Superintendent</em></p>

			<p>Dear Monroe School District families,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">We really miss our students and families! To help maintain positive connections, our staff will be reaching out via phone to every family this week. The purpose of this call is to connect and find out what families’ food and childcare needs are. Many of our staff are making phone calls from our phones at schools, but some are also calling from home using their personal phones, so please know that you may receive a call from an ‘unknown’ number in the coming days and our staff would love to connect with you. We plan to continue these weekly connections with our families throughout the duration of the closure.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We know there is a lot of anxiety about student learning continuing during this closure. We want to make sure our students keep up on their education as much as possible. While we can’t provide complete and equitable online education, we do plan to provide optional enrichment learning opportunities (online and/or paper form) in the near future to help our students enrich their learning during this time. As we continue to receive guidance from the Office of Superintendent of Public Education (OSPI), we are continuing to develop a plan to provide these resources for all of our students. While these resources will not mirror the level of learning support that students receive when school is in session, we hope that they will provide options for students to maintain their learning while out of school.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Monday, we expanded our free meal service to five locations and we have handed out over 1,100 meals to students so far this week. However, we know there are many more students in our community who would like to access meals during school closures. Therefore, we have extended our meal distribution time by an hour so grab and go meals are now handed out 11:30-1:30 Monday through Friday. This service is open to ALL children in our community and includes a lunch and breakfast for the next day. Meals can be picked up at any of our five elementary schools. Learn more <a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus/meals-for-students">here</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We thank you for your patience as our entire state works through the countless details of a school closure of this unprecedented length. We understand this is a challenging time for our students, families, and community, and we will remain in touch with updates and information as they become available. We are still here to help. We urge families to visit our <a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus">COVID-19 webpage</a> where you will find all of our past communications as well as links to additional community resources. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Warm regards,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">Good Morning Monroe School District Families,</p>

<p dir="ltr">I wanted to take just a moment to check in with families who have children that are served with IEPs.  First of all, I want to apologize and thank you for your patience as our entire state works through the countless details of a school closure of this unprecedented length.   Please be assured that, in addition to the general education resources and opportunities that will be available for your children, our special education department is working to develop a plan to provide additional resources and opportunities for each of your children’s identified areas of need.  I am anticipating that this plan will be in place next week. While the supports will not mirror the level of support that your children receive when school is in session and all students are receiving services, we are receiving guidance from the Office of Superintendent of Public Education (OSPI) and are adhering to the expectations of the state.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the District plan is finalized, I will communicate more details.  I will also communicate more formal information with regards to completing open evaluations, conducting IEP meetings, and rescheduling the countless meetings that will, unfortunately, be canceled and postponed during the closure.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This is an ever-changing situation and we are constantly adjusting our planning to be consistent with guidance from the state.  That said, I will do my best to communicate as often as needed and I understand the impact of the disruption of education that all students are experiencing.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">Sincerely,<br>

<p dir="ltr">Dear MHS Student-Athletes and Families,</p>

<p dir="ltr">Never in my mind, did I anticipate something like what we are experiencing at this moment in time...and yet, here we are, at the epicenter of our nation’s crisis. </p>

<p dir="ltr">I’m grateful for our MHS coaching staff and their passionate dedication to our children, as well as their patience and flexibility as we navigate this. I’m also grateful for our student-athletes and the time and efforts they’ve put forth this far in this spring sports season.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I’m disappointed that I have to share with you that effective immediately, the MSD is canceling all athletic practices and competitions through the April 26th school closure (and potentially longer if schools remain closed past that date). I realize this likely causes a myriad of emotions. Please make sure you’re taking care of one another and if you need support from me, feel free to contact me.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Your coaching staff has asked if you can hold optional practices during this time. I have no authority over what student-athletes will do during school closures and strongly recommend that you follow all Department of Health guidance regarding social distancing protocols. I do want to make sure you are aware of the directives I have shared with our coaching staff in regards to optional practices at this time. For liability reasons:</p>

<p dir="ltr">1. Coaches are to steer clear of encouraging or articulating to student-athletes and/or families to get together to practice, play, etc.</p>

<p dir="ltr">2. There will be no campus access for anyone except staff so all facilities are off limits.</p>

<p dir="ltr">3. Should student-athletes get together, coaches (both paid and volunteer) are not to be physically present at any point in time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I appreciate your support of these directives. </p>

<p dir="ltr">I continue to be grateful for your grace and patience. </p>

			<p><meta charset="utf-8">Dear Monroe School District community,</p>

<p dir="ltr">I know that the past two weeks have been stressful for many in our community because of the continued spread of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. Thank you for showing patience and kindness during this unprecedented time for our district. With all the help that our families, our educators, our staff, and our community partners are providing, I know our students will have what they need to stay safe and healthy while our schools remain closed. </p>

<p dir="ltr">We will continue to share information with you as we receive official guidance from the state, OSPI and the State Board of Education and as we confirm ongoing plans moving forward. Thank you for understanding that we do not have answers to all of the questions and are still working diligently to find answers and make appropriate plans. We rely heavily on the professionalism of all of our staff, and have every confidence that our Monroe Team can navigate this successfully together.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I know closing schools for even a single day highly impacts our community. We are happy to share that we have steps in place to address the most critical impacts of an extended closure: </p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Provide meals to students while schools are closed</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Per direction of Governor Inslee, provide childcare during school hours for families who are not able to remain home while serving in critical roles such as healthcare and emergency responders. The Boys and Girls Club and the YMCA are amazing community partners and are doing all they can to help support our families as well.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">We are also working to address concerns and questions about providing additional learning resources for students, graduation, special education, budgeting, evaluations, assessments, scheduling, hiring, and more. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Our district-wide leadership team will continue with our planning on Monday and Tuesday and will have further direction for our community soon. Some additional staff members will need to report to work to meet the immediate needs of students and families and we are extremely grateful for their help during these trying times. No other staff aside from those serving in those immediately essential roles will be reporting until further notice. Because schools and the district office are closed those not reporting to work include: building or departmental office personnel, teachers, paraeducators, bus drivers, and specialists. All staff will continue to receive their hourly wage or salary. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Again, I express my gratitude for your patience and understanding as we continue to work through this difficult situation. The next several weeks will be challenging but I know we will get through it together.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Warm regards,</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr. Fredrika Smith<br>

<h3 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-7e533f3d-7fff-4f28-b40c-9eca6b3e9038">Food Service</b></h3>

<p dir="ltr">On Monday, March 16th we will be expanding our free grab ‘n go meal service to all five of our elementary schools: Chain Lake, Fryelands, Frank Wagner, Maltby and Salem Woods Elementaries from noon - 1:00 p.m.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition, the grab ‘n go meal will now include a breakfast for the following morning. To help us with planning to ensure we have enough meals for everyone in need, we are asking people to pre-order if it is possible to do so. To pre-order your meals for Monday, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/Jr6jv2e97rdqpv2q6">online</a> order form: <a href="https://forms.gle/Jr6jv2e97rdqpv2q6">https://forms.gle/Jr6jv2e97rdqpv2q6</a> or leave a detailed message on our meal pre-order line: 360-804-2525. Pre-orders will close at 8:00 a.m. each day. If you are unable to pre-order or forgot to place an order, please still go to one of the five locations listed above as we will have extras. Again, the pre-ordering is to help our food services team accurately prepare to assist as many people as possible.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is important to note: the children you are ordering meals for must be with you when you come to the school to pick up the meal(s). We can only provide the meal(s) if children are present. </p>

<p dir="ltr">As the current situation is still very fluid, the above protocol is subject to modification pending new developments. We will provide updated guidance/direction to you ASAP should things change. We will also be looking at staffing options to try to increase access to these services.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-7e533f3d-7fff-4f28-b40c-9eca6b3e9038">Childcare Options</b></h3>

<p dir="ltr">In response to our community need for daycare, our community partners have graciously offered the following options:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://bgcsc.org/snohomish-clubs/monroe-club/">Monroe Boys and Girls Club</a>: Normal childcare rates will be discounted by 50% to lessen the impact on our families during school closures. Space is available at most clubs for new members, please contact your local club for more information and availability. As a thank you to our healthcare professionals and first responders, their children will be given free childcare during this time.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://ymca-snoco.org/our-locations/monroesky-valley-ymca/">Monroe/Sky Valley YMCA</a>: The YMCA is also offering daycare for healthcare and first responder families at no cost, with a $45.00 daily rate for drop-in children, and financial aid for families in need. They are asking families to please try to sign up this weekend or Monday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thank you Monroe Boys and Girls Club and Monroe/Sky Valley YMCA!</p>

			<p><meta charset="utf-8">Dear Families, </p>

<p dir="ltr">We understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for everyone, as we navigate uncharted territory. As a community, we will persevere in caring for ourselves, our families, and each other while utilizing the utmost care and caution for health and safety. </p>

<p dir="ltr">This is a particularly difficult time for parents, who may feel unsure about how to address the novel Coronavirus outbreak, or why schools are closed, with their children. With that in mind, we hope the following tips will help you navigate these conversations with your families. It is important to keep conversations age-appropriate, and to speak plainly with children to reduce fear and anxiety.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Validate their feelings without increasing their fears.</strong> <br><em><u>For young children (grades K-5), say things like</u></em>:</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I know that it might feel scary or strange to hear the news about the Coronavirus. I feel worried, too, but we know some good things to do to help stay safe.” </p>

<p dir="ltr">“It’s okay to feel sad or confused about being out of school. We did not know this would happen, and sometimes surprises can be difficult to manage.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><u>For adolescents and teens (grades 6-12), allow them to share their thoughts</u></em>:</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I know this is frightening, and everyone feels uncertain right now. Do you want to talk about your concerns?” (It’s okay to just listen and validate their feelings. We do not have all the answers, so it is important to tell them that what they are feeling is normal - and temporary.)</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Be honest and talk about ways to stay safe. </strong><br><em>Note: Please do not promise your child they will not get sick because that cannot be guaranteed.</em> Instead, tell them that doctors are saying it is unusual for children and young, healthy people to get very sick. You may also tell them that most people who get the Coronavirus feel sick for a while, but they get better. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Tell them the best way to stay healthy is to wash their hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds every time. Encourage them to wash their hands before every meal, and after they have been outside or in a public space (like a grocery store). </p>

<p dir="ltr">Encourage children with electronic devices to wipe them down with appropriate cleansers daily. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Maintain a structured day to the best of your ability.</strong>Young children need structure and routine to maintain a sense of normalcy and calm. Please follow guidelines and recommendations by your school leaders and teachers for continued learning activities. Make a daily plan with your child to include time for learning, time for play, and time for meals. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Encourage play and social connection in safe ways.</strong><br>
Children need physical activity and play to release tension, and to keep their bodies healthy. While play dates may not be the best idea for everyone, it’s a good idea to go for walks or ride bikes in the neighborhood. </p>

<p dir="ltr">With your help, kids may be able to chat with their friends via Google Hangouts, Skype, or Zoom. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>With regard to screen time…</em><br>
Try to balance your young child’s screen time by adding (free) online programs such as GoNoodle, which encourages movement, silliness, and learning. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>For teenagers</em>: Remember that their social lives exist over screens, and more so now, while school is cancelled. Social connection is very important to reduce stress, but encourage balance between learning activities, self-care practices (i.e. exercise, reading, art, music, etc.), and social screen time. Talk to your teen about their online social life, and ask them if the conversations and connections feel helpful or stressful. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Estimadas familias,</p>

<p dir="ltr">Entendemos que este es un momento estresante e incierto para todos, mientras navegamos por un territorio desconocido. Como comunidad, perseveraremos en cuidarnos a nosotros mismos, a nuestras familias y a los demás, mientras utilizamos el máximo cuidado y precaución para la salud y la seguridad.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Este es un momento particularmente difícil para los padres, que pueden sentirse inseguros sobre cómo abordar el nuevo brote de coronavirus o por qué las escuelas están cerradas con sus hijos. Con eso en mente, esperamos que los siguientes consejos lo ayuden a navegar estas conversaciones con sus familias. Es importante mantener conversaciones apropiadas para la edad y hablar claramente con los niños para reducir el miedo y la ansiedad.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Valide sus sentimientos sin aumentar sus miedos.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Para niños pequeños (grados K-5), diga cosas como:</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Sé que puedes sentirte con miedo o sentirse extraño escuchar las noticias sobre el Coronavirus. También me siento preocupado, pero sabemos algunas cosas buenas que podemos hacer para ayudar a mantenernos a salvo ".</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Está bien sentirse triste o confundido por estar fuera de la escuela. No sabíamos que esto sucedería, y a veces las sorpresas pueden ser difíciles de manejar”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Para adolescentes y adolescentes (grados 6-12), permítanles compartir sus pensamientos/ideas:</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Sé que esto es aterrador, y todos se sienten inseguros en este momento. ¿Quieres hablar sobre tus preocupaciones? (Está bien escuchar y validar sus sentimientos. No tenemos todas las respuestas, por lo que es importante decirles que lo que sienten es normal y temporal).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sea honesto y hable sobre maneras de mantenerse a salvo.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nota: No le prometa a su hijo que no se enfermará porque eso no se puede garantizar. En cambio, dígales que los médicos dicen que es inusual que los niños y las personas jóvenes y saludables se enferman gravemente. También puede decirles que la mayoría de las personas que contraen el coronavirus se sienten enfermas por un tiempo, pero mejoran.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dígales que la mejor manera de mantenerse saludable es lavarse las manos con jabón y agua tibia durante 20 segundos cada vez. Anímalos a lavarse las manos antes de cada comida y después de haber estado afuera o en un espacio público (como una tienda de comestibles).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Anime a los niños con dispositivos electrónicos a limpiarlos diariamente con limpiadores apropiados.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mantenga un día estructurado lo mejor que pueda.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Los niños pequeños necesitan estructura y rutina para mantener una sensación de normalidad y calma. Siga las pautas y recomendaciones de los líderes y maestros de su escuela para continuar con las actividades de aprendizaje. Haga un plan diario con su hijo que incluya tiempo para aprender, tiempo para jugar y tiempo para comidas.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Fomentar el juego y la conexión social de manera segura.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Los niños necesitan actividad física y juegos para liberar tensiones y mantener sus cuerpos saludables. Si bien las fechas de juego pueden no ser la mejor idea para todos, es una buena idea salir a caminar o andar en bicicleta en el vecindario.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Con su ayuda, los niños pueden chatear con sus amigos a través de Hangouts de Google, Skype o Zoom.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Con respecto al tiempo de pantalla ...</p>

<p dir="ltr">Intente equilibrar el tiempo de pantalla de su hijo pequeño agregando programas en línea (gratuitos) como GoNoodle, que fomenta el movimiento, las tonterías y el aprendizaje.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Para los adolescentes: recuerden que sus vidas sociales existen en las pantallas, y más aún ahora, mientras se cancela la escuela. La conexión social es muy importante para reducir el estrés, pero fomenta el equilibrio entre las actividades de aprendizaje, las prácticas de autocuidado (es decir, ejercicio, lectura, arte, música, etc.) y el tiempo de pantalla social. Hable con su adolescente sobre su vida social en línea y pregúntele si las conversaciones y las conexiones se sienten útiles o estresantes.</p>

			<p>To Our Bearcat Community,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">First, we want to say thank you to all of our students and families. In times of uncertainty, we often either see the best of each other or the worst (visit a local Costco and you will likely see some of both). And we are seeing the best from our Bearcat Family. Students and parents continue to be patient as we work on how we can best support learning during this unprecedented time. Teachers are teaming up and thinking of new ways to support learning as we continue to focus on our three MHS commitments:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>We create intentional connections with each other</li>
	<li>We are present and engaged (with each other, with our work, with ourselves, etc)</li>
	<li>Every Bearcat moving forward, every day<br>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Creating Intentional Connection: When talking with our staff on Friday it was clear that their biggest disappointment with schools being closed was that they couldn’t continue to see, support, and love our students through a time that they knew was stressful and anxiety-producing. They were immediately asking for help with the best ways to stay in contact throughout this great unknown. We asked them to slow down on communicating for a couple of days while our district determined how to best support students so we could have a common message to everyone. On Monday and Tuesday of this week, district administrators will be meeting to discuss exactly that. What are the best ways for teachers to support our students? What forms of communication will work best for our diverse community? How do we maintain our commitment to connecting with kids when we can’t be together at school? Expect communication from your students’ teachers to pick back up later this week after we’ve had a chance to better explore our options. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Being Present and Engaged In Our Work: The work we will be providing over these next few weeks is not required but that doesn’t make it any less valuable. Teachers will be providing resources and learning opportunities for students. It is important that students engage with this work to continue to grow in their learning and be ready for their return to school. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Every Bearcat Moving Forward Every Day: Even though school is closed it is important that we don’t stop pushing forward. Our MHS commitments are all about our school’s why: Preparing Successful Adults. How to deal with a surprise or sudden change will be a skill that all of our students will need after they leave MHS and this is a perfect time to work on adaptability, positive thinking, and unique problem-solving. Our teachers are working on how to offer school in a completely new way and we know our students will rise to the challenge of learning in this uncharted territory. </p>

<p dir="ltr">We know that there are some specific questions that are out there and we will do our best to address these as soon as we can:</p>

<ul dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li role="presentation">We are in the middle of registration for next year’s classes and are continuing to move forward with this. Please use the Counseling Office Website for directions and suggestions for registration.  <a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/mhs/student-learning/course-registration">https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/mhs/student-learning/course-registration</a> </li>
	<li role="presentation">Class of 2020: We understand that what is a stressful time for all is particularly challenging for our seniors. Senior year is designed to make memories and our hearts are breaking for the seniors right now. Our counselors are hard at work looking at graduation requirements and we are working with the State Board of Education to determine what needs to be completed for each individual senior. As for the activities that make up the senior’s spring, we will communicate information as soon as we have any. </li>
	<li role="presentation">AP Tests: We have contacted the College Board and are working to see what options are available for later test dates. </li>
	<li role="presentation">Students on IEPs: As we work on our plan for what school will look like for all students we will be using IEP goals and accommodations as a guide for supporting the needs of students on IEPs. </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Again, we want to thank everyone for your patience and grace as we work to find answers to your many questions. Know that our staff is determined to create the best educational experience possible under the circumstances for each and every student. Watching them say emotional goodbyes to students on Thursday and then come together in teams on Friday to immediately get to work on creating learning opportunities showed a level of commitment to students that is inspiring. We will be in touch soon. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Even in uncertain times, IT’S A GREAT DAY TO BE A BEARCAT!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Your Monroe High School Administrators,<br><em>Mr. Crow; Mr. Molina; Ms. Siemers; Ms. Tarrach, and Ms. Mundell</em></p>

			<p>Greetings Hidden River and Park Place Middle School Families,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">Today our teachers and staff were here at school, working together and planning for the unknown and uncertainty of what lies ahead.  As you know this is uncharted territory for our students, staff and families, both on a professional and a personal level. We appreciate your patience as we thoughtfully plan and prepare for the next 6 weeks.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">As we continue to get frequent guidance from our county and state leaders on the parameters that we are working under, our goal moving forward for our middle school students is (1) that we continue to provide resources and learning opportunities for them on a week by week basis and (2) that our students continue to experience a sense of connection to their school and teachers for as long as our schools remained closed to students.  At both schools, nothing has changed in terms of our mission to prepare all of our students to be successful in middle school, high school, and beyond.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">Early next week we will have more information communicated out to our families regarding what our process and weekly routines will be to provide students learning opportunities and a regular connection point with a staff member.  As we have been planning today on what this will look like, what has emerged louder than ever before is the unsurpassed level of commitment and collaboration that our staff is displaying because of how much they care about our kids.  In a time of uncertainty, this certain response from our middle school staff was quite inspiring.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">For next week specifically, please expect communication with more details from each school, a 1st round of learning resources and opportunities by next Friday, and a personal phone call or e-mail from a staff member, checking in with families and students and laying the groundwork for the next several weeks.  We thank you again for your support, patience, and courage as we navigate the unforeseen together on behalf of our students.  <br>
 </p>

			<p>Dear elementary families,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">We want to thank you for your support, patience, and partnership during this unprecedented time. We know that the announcement of long-term closure comes with many questions, challenges, and uncertainties. We are operating under very fluid conditions and while we are planning, we know we have to be flexible as we respond to changing information and requirements. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Here are some updates:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>Resource packets: We have provided some resources for families that came home in student backpacks yesterday. Please note that some (especially books and classroom resources) will need to be returned when we are back at school. This is uncharted territory for all of us, and we know that some of you feel ill-equipped to support your child’s learning at home. These materials are being sent home so students can continue to learn at their own pace with materials that are familiar to them. We are not requiring students to complete these activities at this time.</li>
	<li>Conferences: At this time, the traditional elementary school spring conferences that were scheduled for March 17-20 are canceled. We are working through plans to evaluate these important parent/teacher meetings and are looking at a variety of possibilities. We will share these details with elementary families as soon as plans are finalized.</li>
	<li>Breakfast &amp; Lunches: We will be providing breakfast and lunch for students who need them long term, but are unsure what that will look like in the coming weeks. Information is forthcoming.</li>
	<li>State Testing: <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/2EwAWKoLq-2USvCdiFnZ-g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgTAAKP0RbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuazEyLndhLnVzL3NpdGVzL2RlZmF1bHQvZmlsZXMvcHVibGljL2NvbW11bmljYXRpb25zL1NjaG9vbENsb3N1cmVzUWFuZEEwMzEyLnBkZlcHc2Nob29sbUIKAACKzGpeBlmzQlIYYXB0ZXJhQG1vbnJvZS53ZWRuZXQuZWR1WAQAAAAB">OSPI</a> is canceling all state testing for the 2019–20 school year. This includes the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA), the Washington Comprehensive Assessment of Science (WCAS), the Washington Access to Instruction and Measurement (WA-AIM), and WIDA Alternate ACCESS for English learners.</li>
	<li>Family Access: If you have not already signed up for email and text notification through <a href="https://www2.nwrdc.wa-k12.net/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wmonroes71/fwemnu01.w">family access</a>, please do so. This ensures that you will receive updated and current information.</li>

<p>Dear Monroe School District community,</p>

<p dir="ltr">We thank you for your patience and understanding during this time of uncertainty as we work together to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout our communities. We know the long-term school closures will create many hardships for families and we know you have many concerns. We share those same concerns and we are doing our very best to find solutions to meet the many needs of our students, families, and staff. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Below are answers to some of the many questions we are receiving. We will continue to share information with you as we receive official guidance from OSPI and the State Board of Education and as we finalize plans moving forward. Please understand that we do not have answers to all of the questions and we are working diligently to find answers and make plans. Now, more than ever, please make sure your contact information is up to date at your child’s school. If you need to make changes, please call your school front office.  </p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr. Fredrika Smith<br><em>Superintendent</em></p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A six-week closure seems extreme. How was this decision made?</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">We have had many lengthy discussions with the Snohomish Health District, Governor Jay Inslee, <a href="https://medium.com/waospi/reykdal-mandatory-school-closures-will-save-lives-357b871e6bf7">OSPI</a>, and other school district superintendents throughout Snohomish, King and Pierce Counties. All parties have come to the agreement that in order to help reduce the impact of COVID-19, all K-12 schools in the most highly affected counties need to close for an extended period of time. <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-school-closures-king-snohomish-and-pierce%C2%A0counties">The governor has issued an executive order</a> to close all schools in the three counties through April 24, 2020.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will Sno-Isle classes still be in session during the closure? What about Running Start?</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">The Sno-Isle Skills Center is managed by the Mukilteo School District and they are also closed through April 24th in alignment with the Governor’s Executive Order. Families with students in Running Start will need to contact the university where classes are held to see if they are remaining open to students. No out-of-district transportation will be provided during the closure.</p>

<h2><strong>Are all events, activities, athletics, meetings, etc. canceled until April 24?</strong></h2>

<p>All events, activities, meetings and use of our facilities by outside organizations are canceled during this closure. All school activities, including parent information nights, concerts, drama productions, and club meetings are also canceled at this time. Middle school athletics, including practices and competitions, are suspended.</p>

<p>All MHS athletic practices and competitions are currently canceled through March 22nd. At this time, we are closely monitoring the schools in our WESCO league, as well as neighboring leagues to make an aligned decision for athletics. We anticipate an update by the middle of next week with further information in regards to what happens after the 22nd. </p>

<h2 dir="ltr">What about elementary school conferences?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">At this time, the traditional elementary school spring conferences that were scheduled for March 17-20 are canceled. We are working through plans to evaluate these important parent/teacher meetings and are looking at a variety of possibilities. We will share these details with elementary families as soon as plans are finalized.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Will we need to make up the days at the end of the school year?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">OSPI expects districts to make every effort possible to make-up any days and instructional hours lost due to the COVID-19 outbreak, including extending the school year to June 19 if necessary. Currently, <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/public/communications/COVID-19%20in%20Schools_Parent%20Guide.pdf">OSPI</a> is stating that they will file an emergency rule to allow school districts to waive the days and instructional hours that districts won’t be able to make up after June 19. This rule will be in effect for the 2019–20 school year only. </p>

<h2 dir="ltr">What about graduation?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The Washington State Board of Education makes determinations regarding graduation and we are awaiting official guidance from them.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Will this have an impact on student testing?</h2>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/public/communications/SchoolClosuresQandA0312.pdf">OSPI</a> is canceling all state testing for the 2019–20 school year. This includes the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA), the Washington Comprehensive Assessment of Science (WCAS), the Washington Access to Instruction and Measurement (WA-AIM), and WIDA Alternate ACCESS for English learners. </p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Are you providing online distance learning for students?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">At this time, the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/about-ospi/press-releases/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-resources">Washington State Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)</a> does not recommend closed traditional schools transition to an online distance model unless the district can ensure each of the considerations below can be met. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li role="presentation">Ensuring ALL students in the district will have equitable access to the learning and required materials, including technology.</li>
	<li role="presentation">Ensuring the online learning system can effectively support the district’s different learning and teaching needs, including the ability to provide differentiated instruction as well as one-on-one support for students who need it. Regardless of where the learning is happening, supports identified on a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) must be provided if the district is operating.</li>
	<li role="presentation">Providing training to staff, students, and parents and guardians on how the system works and what expectations the district has.</li>
	<li role="presentation">The ability to track the attendance of both students and staff.</li>
	<li role="presentation">Ensuring the systems in use are secure and will not allow for the release of protected student or staff information.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Taking a traditional school environment online is not a simple task – nor is it one that should be attempted without serious consideration of the practicality and risk. </p>

<p dir="ltr">In the Monroe School District, we are committed to equitable access for all students and because our traditional schools cannot meet all of the above constraints from OSPI, we will not be providing formalized online distance learning at this time. </p>

<p dir="ltr">We understand that many of our families may not feel equipped to support their child’s learning at home. We are working to gather resources that families may use at home if they choose. Families are encouraged to set a schedule and space for learning time each day, even if it is just spending time reading. Talk to your child about the importance of maintaining the skills they have, because, like anything, if we don’t continue to practice regularly we will lose some of those skills. </p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Is the district still providing breakfast and lunch for students who need it?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">On Friday, March 13th, we will be providing grab-and-go lunches for any Monroe School District student, available at Fryelands Elementary and Frank Wagner Elementary. We will be providing breakfast and lunch for students who need them long term, but are unsure what that will look like in the coming weeks. We will share details early next week once plans are finalized. </p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Are you providing childcare for students of working families?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Per direction of Governor Inslee, our district’s priority is to provide childcare during school hours for families who are not able to remain home while serving in critical community roles such as healthcare and emergency responders. Our team is currently working to address this important need and we will share updates when we have more information. </p>

<p dir="ltr">If you are an emergency responder or work in the healthcare industry and need childcare in order to report to work during school hours, please notify Joanne Dickinson at <a href="mailto:dickinsonj@monroe.wednet.edu">dickinsonj@monroe.wednet.edu</a> or (360)804-2530.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Are visitors allowed in schools during the closure?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Parents will be permitted to pick up paperwork and student materials in schools’ main offices Friday, March 13 only. No visitors will be allowed to enter schools during the closure to minimize the spread of the virus after Friday, March 13. If you have an emergency that may require you to be on school campus, please schedule an appointment with your school administrator. </p>

<p dir="ltr">We are working through the details of what kindergarten registration will look like and will share that information as soon as it is finalized.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Will the district office be open during the closure?</h2>

<p dir="ltr">At this time, the district office will remain open; however, we will be following social distancing guidelines and ask that all visitors not enter if they are:</p>

<ul dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li role="presentation">Sick</li>
	<li role="presentation">Experiencing a fever or respiratory illness </li>
	<li role="presentation">Have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days</li>
</ul>

<p>Dear Monroe School District community,</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<p dir="ltr">After conference calls today with the Snohomish Department of Emergency Management, Governor Jay Inslee, and other Superintendents from throughout Snohomish County, we have made the decision to close all MSD schools to students beginning Friday, March 13 in order to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 throughout our communities. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Tomorrow, Thursday, March 12, will be a regular school day. This will allow for an additional day of learning and time for students to bring home any personal items they might want while schools are closed. At this time we anticipate being closed to students for 6 weeks (through April 24th) in alignment with other local school districts and will re-evaluate the need for further closures during that time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This was not a decision we came to lightly and our plans moving forward require additional planning and preparation. We will spend the remainder of this week planning for alternatives for the following services:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
<li role="presentation">Food and Nutrition Services</li>
	<li role="presentation">Potential childcare during school hours for families who are not able to remain home and serve in critical community roles such as healthcare and first responders</li>
	<li role="presentation">Educational resources and support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">We recognize this closure creates many different challenges and our goal is to continue to provide basic services to support students and their families throughout our community.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We will continue to provide updated information over the next two days and we ask for your patience as our staff work through planning. We know that our staff and community will have many, many questions and we will work to get information to you as we work to navigate this uncharted territory.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We strongly urge families to follow the updated guidance from the <a href="https://www.snohd.org/484/Novel-Coronavirus-2019">Snohomish Health District</a> for social distancing and other precautions in an effort to slow the spread of this virus. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Again, thank you for staying calm and working with us as we work through the COVID-19 pandemic and please remember to check the <a href="https://www.monroe.wednet.edu/departments/health-services/coronavirus">district website</a> for updates and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>
