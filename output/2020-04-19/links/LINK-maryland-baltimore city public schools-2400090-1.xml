<p><strong>Notice regarding COVID-19 case at City Neighbors Hamilton</strong></p>

<p>Baltimore City Public Schools has learned that an individual working at the emergency meal site at City Neighbors Hamilton recently tested positive for COVID-19. The individual may have had contact with others. In conversations with the individual, they began to display symptoms Tuesday. According to health experts, a person infected with COVID-19 is contagious two days before they start to show symptoms.</p>

<p>Out of respect for the employee’s confidentiality, we cannot release any personal information.</p>

<p>City Schools places the highest priority on the health, safety, and well-being of our community while working diligently to support the education and social needs of its families. The district is offering the following guidance:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Effective Friday, April 10, City Schools will close City Neighbors Hamilton to follow the district’s Standard Operating Procedure on cleaning and disinfecting school buildings. </strong></li>
	<li>Individuals who may have been in contact with staff working at the City Neighbors Hamilton emergency meal site should self-monitor for symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath for 2-14 days. </li>
	<li>
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html%C2%A0">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, if you think you have been exposed to COVID 19 and develop a fever and symptoms, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider for medical advice. </li>
	<li>For students and families seeking meals or learning packets, please visit our <a href="/meal-sites">Meal Sites webpage</a> for a list of 17 other sites where meals and learning packets will be available. We will notify the community of the date when the meal site at City Neighbors Hamilton will reopen.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the situation continues to change rapidly, we will work to keep you updated regarding this rapidly evolving situation. And again, we encourage everyone to avoid contact with others. <br>

<p><strong>Distribution of devices for distance learning</strong><br>
We are providing many tools and resources to help students and their families access materials during this period of distance learning. This includes loaning computers to many students. As you’re aware, we asked families to complete a survey about food and technology needs. Results from the survey have and will continue to inform our plan for distributing the computers. Please complete the survey if you haven’t already. <br><br>
Beginning Monday, April 13, some high school students will begin to receive computers. We are prioritizing students in these grades to make sure they can meet graduation requirements. Principals and school staff will contact families of students who have been identified to receive a computer with instructions and possible dates and times for picking up the computer. This information will also be available<a href="/distance-learning"> on the distance learning page</a> on Friday. <br><br>
The week of April 20, students in other grades who have been identified as needing a computer will be notified by their school leader that they may pick up computers at their schools during specified time periods that will continue through the end of April. <br><br>
If you have questions about homework, class assignments, online learning, or need support accessing tools such as Google Classroom and BlackBoard Collaborate, please call the help desk at 443-984-2001, Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., or visit the <a href="/distance-learning">distance learning</a> or <a href="/online-learning-support">online learning support</a> pages on the district website.<br><br><strong>Observing religious holidays</strong><br>
The COVID-19 pandemic is unlike any challenge our nation has ever faced, forcing us to make many adaptations and some radical changes to the ways in which we live, work and educate our young people. A few changes we were required to make in our annual Spring Break schedule, and what that means for upcoming religious observances. </p>

<p>As you know, Spring Break for schools was originally scheduled from Monday, April 6 through Monday, April 13, and was linked to days of observance for Passover and Easter. As a result of the first school closure period related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the district followed the recommendation of MSDE to change the dates for Spring Break for schools to Friday, March 20 through the following Friday, March 27. These changes eliminated the correlation that we had planned between the Spring Break dates and observance of these key holidays. </p>

<p>We recognize that the observance of such high holy days is important to many staff members. Students and families may find that some teachers and staff members will be unavailable on April 10-12, as they use personal time to observe this period. We thank you for your support and patience as employees recognize this religious season.</p>

<p><img alt="wellness wednesday" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="05e28cae-3ea6-4ce7-aa6a-45564ff1fd1d" height="137" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/wellness_wednesday_banner_2.png" width="410"><br><strong>City Schools Growing and Thriving Together: Compassionate, Connected, and Courageous</strong></p>

<p>At City Schools, we believe that <a href="/blueprint">nurturing student wholeness</a> is not only a top priority but a key part of how we ensure the success of our students as learners and as leaders in their schools and communities. This means that we must:</p>

<ul>
<li>support students’ physical, social, and emotional well-being, as well as their academic growth,</li>
	<li>help them explore their interests and identities, and</li>
	<li>make sure they have trusting and supportive relationships with people inside and beyond their school communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also means that we must build healthy learning environments that are safe and nurturing for all young people to enable them to reach their highest potential.</p>

<p><strong>We are Here to Support</strong></p>

<p>To help our students navigate this time in a way that ensures they are safe and whole, it is important that the adults in their lives—parents, family members, teachers, coaches, mentors, faith leaders, and others—all work together to provide care and comfort. We recognize that for some of our students, this period of uncertainty may be challenging and stressful. Some of ways we can support are by…</p>

<ul>
<li>creating opportunities for students to express what they are feeling</li>
	<li>helping them to learn simple ways to manage stress and anxiety</li>
	<li>and encouraging them to stay connected to family, friends, teachers, and classmates.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we know that this is not just a hard time for many of our students—it can be just as tough on adults. Many of us are struggling to manage our own anxiety, sense of isolation, or the stresses caused by being stuck at home, dealing with work related issues or unemployment, and figuring out how to parent children through these unprecedented experiences—including having to suddenly support our kids’ learning at home. To be fully present for our young people, we must tend to our own physical and emotional well-being, too.<br><br>
We are here for you. We are in this together.<br><br>
As we continue to monitor this ever-changing situation, City Schools will continue to provide support that addresses the unique needs of our students and families. Each week, on “Wellness Wednesdays,” we will use this space to provide a variety of tools and resources that support students and families in taking care of themselves, each other, and their communities. <br><br>
Our aim is to stay connected, compassionate, and courageous as a community through these challenging times.<br><br>
This week <a href="https://casel.org/sp_faq/guidelines-for-parents-and-caregivers/">check out this tip sheet for families and caregivers from our partners</a> at the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) about how to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAhfsC73JgM">The Kids’ Guide to Coronavirus with Kristen Bell!</a> From Nickelodeon is also a great resource for helping answer young people’s questions about COVID-19.<br><br><strong>For more information, please see the following:</strong><br><br>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong>Third Quarter Grading Update</strong><br>
City Schools firmly believes that grades are a measure of students’ progress in their courses. To promote the continuation of academic engagement during the school building closure period, the district will take the following actions regarding grading in the Third Quarter:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span>Student work completed through March 12 will not be adversely impacted due to the school building closure period.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><strong><span><span><span><span>Students have until Friday, April 10, to submit any remaining assignments that were due through March 12.</span></span></span></span></strong></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Teachers will communicate to students and parents the expectations for submitting makeup assignments and methods of submission. Students may have varied points of access to resources; therefore, teachers will consider accessibility limitations and exercise reasonable flexibility. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span>Again, all students have until Friday, April 10 to complete any uncompleted assignments and make-up work provided through March 12.<br><br><em>City Schools, similar to other school districts statewide, is seeking guidance from the Maryland State Department of Education regarding the grading of work packets and other assignments given during the closure period that began on March 16. City Schools will provide updates to students, families, and staff after receiving clarification by state officials.</em></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Message regarding COVID-19 case</strong><br><br><span><span><span>Dear City Schools students, families, staff members, and community partners, </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Baltimore City Public Schools has learned that an individual supporting Steuart Hill Academic Academy recently tested positive for COVID-19 during the school building closure period. Once the person’s condition was known, they immediately ceased contact with the campus. </span><span>Based on discussions and a review of the timeline, the individual contracted the virus after schools were closed. </span><span>Out of respect for the individual’s confidentiality, we cannot release any personal information.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In recent days, federal and state leaders have been clear that as we learn more about the spread of COVID-19, additional cases will become known. City Schools places the highest priority on the health, safety, and well-being of our community while working diligently to support the education and social needs of its families.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>The district is taking actions to continue distributing learning materials and emergency meals that are consistent with guidance from federal health authorities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as the Baltimore City Health Department. </span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The following steps reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure include:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span><span><span>To the greatest extent possible, practicing social distancing when distributing emergency meals or learning packets.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Encouraging frequent handwashing for employees that are working.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Cleaning and sanitizing high-use areas, paying particular attention to shared surfaces (doorknobs, sink/toilet handles, elevator buttons, etc.).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Taking all available steps to reduce the time and number of interactions between all parties at our meal sites, including the use of designated interaction points.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><strong><span>In alignment with directives from Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and guidance from the Baltimore City Health Department, City Schools strongly encourages students and families to avoid contact with other individuals unless absolutely necessary.</span></strong> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>As the situation continues to change rapidly, we will work to keep you updated regarding this rapidly evolving situation, including updates on cases that have a direct impact on the delivery of services. And again, we encourage everyone to avoid contact with others. Please continue to check the school district’s Health Updates Web site for information.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Thank you, and be safe.</span></span></span></p>
