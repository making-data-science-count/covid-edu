			<p>HMB Public School is continuing to monitor the spread of COVID-19, more commonly known as Coronavirus. We are in regular contact with local and state health officials, as well as other local school districts and colleges, and we are taking direction from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p><strong>April 5th Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Distance Learning</span>:  </strong>After implementing our Distance Learning Plan for one week, administrators, teachers, and staff met in a Zoom meeting to discuss our progress.  We all feel the distance learning is going well and will continue to improve as we continue to have the opportunities and experiences with it.  Teachers will continue to communicate plans for instruction and are providing learning activities through Google Classroom, Microsoft Office 365, Remind, other platforms, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>instructional learning packets will be delivered home to students every Monday morning during the closure</strong></span>.  Daily check-ins will occur with class advisors and teachers to ensure student participation and engagement.  Please encourage and help your students to access their device and communicate with their teachers.  Thank you again for your patience and understanding.  We look forward to continuing the education of our students.  WE MISS YOU!  Stay safe and stay connected!</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Locker Room Items</strong></span><strong>:  </strong>Locker room items have been collected and placed into clear plastic bags.  <strong>We will be providing families and students the opportunity to come to the school and pick up their locker room belongings on Monday and Wednesday this week.  We will be setting the bags on tables outside of the south parking lot doors from 10:00am to 12:00pm.</strong>  Supervision of the belongings will take place during this time.  Feel free to come to the school and claim your belongings during the scheduled time.</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Food Service</u></strong><strong>:  </strong>HMB will continue to provide breakfast and lunch throughout the duration of the school closure.  As mentioned previously, due to new funding made available to schools this week, we have the pleasure and opportunity to provide meals for all children ages 1-18 who reside in our school district.  Communication has been made to all families as we make plans to continue to offer food services to the community.  If you were not contacted or have changed your mind, please call the school as soon as possible to be added to the program.  <strong>We will have meal pickups on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00am-12:00pm at two locations; in Hazelton at the school and in Moffit at the post office.</strong>  The number of meals we provide will contain food for a week.</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Social Distancing</u></strong><strong>:  </strong>Please practice Social Distancing to the best of your ability.  We encourage families to avoid public meeting places currently while continuing to practice effective hygiene methods.<strong>  </strong>
</li>

<p>Below are today’s updates regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation.  We continue to base our updates on information we receive from the state and federal agencies, including information from Governor Burgum’s daily news conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>School Cancellation</strong></span>:  School is canceled through Friday, March 20th, and Governor Burgum announced he plans to have an update on school closures by 4:00pm tomorrow (March 19th).</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Food Service</u></strong><strong>:  </strong>HMB provided two days of breakfasts and lunches for students on Tuesday.  We will distribute the meals again on Thursday and families can pick up the meals from 10:00am and 1:00pm.  Communication has been made to all families offering grab-and-go breakfast and lunch available for all students, however, you still have the opportunity to be added to the program.  Please call the school at 701-782-6231 as soon as possible tomorrow morning.</li>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Distance Learning</strong></span>:  Teachers continue to make plans for providing education to HMB students.  Again, the plans are being made to prepare for the possibility of extended school closures.  We continue to look at all avenues to provide education, including using platforms such as Google Classroom, Office 365, and other online resources, as well as preparing packets of instruction and activities for students to work on at home.  We will be taking this process in an organized and thorough manner.  We value our students’ education and need to make sure we are prepared to give them the best education we are able to provide.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Safe Return to School</strong></span>:  In the event Governor Burgum allows schools to reopen, HMB will follow procedures that will be beneficial to the safety and health of our students and staff.  We are currently working on the procedure and will share it when we have all the steps in place.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>March 17th Update:</strong></p>
<p>In our continued efforts to communicate with you during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, we will update this site daily.  Below are updates based on the most recent information we have received today:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Instructional Days Forgiven</strong></span>:  Last night, Governor Burgum announced that K-12 schools which were closed this week by executive order will not have to make up the instructional time later this school year.</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Food Service</u></strong><strong>:  </strong>HMB provided two days of breakfasts and lunches for students today.  Families were able to pick up the meals at the school from 10:00am-1:00pm.  We are very pleased with how the program worked out!  Thank you so much to all families who participated for your cooperation and understanding.  We will distribute the meals again on Thursday during the same time frame.  Communication has been made to all families offering grab-and-go breakfast and lunch available for all students, however, you still have the opportunity to be added to the program.  Please call the school to do so at 701-782-6231.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Distance Learning</strong></span>:  Today, HMB staff contacted all families to determine if they have internet access at home and if they have access to a device.  This information is now being used by administration and teachers to begin the planning process for distance learning.  HMB is being proactive as there is potential for Governor Burgum to extend school closures and order schools to provide an alternative way to deliver instruction and educate students at home.  We are looking at all avenues to provide education, including using platforms such as Google Classroom, Office 365, and other online resources, as well as preparing packets of instruction and activities for students to work on at home.  Keep in mind, we have yet to receive this order, but we will be prepared if closures continue.</li>
