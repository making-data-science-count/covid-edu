        <h2>Determination of Critical Infrastructure Workers and Essential Employees Performing Necessary Government Activities</h2>

<p>On Monday, March 23, 2020, Governor Whitmer issued Executive Order No. 2020-21 (COVID-19) ordering residents to remain at home to the maximum extent feasible. The Order provides exceptions for workers “whose presence is strictly necessary to enable, support, or facilitate the work of critical infrastructure workers.”</p>

<p>The following is a list of Berkley School District employees who are considered critical workers or essential for the support of critical workers and may be working in the District while this Executive Order is in effect. </p>

<ol>
<li>Technology Department staff who support teachers with virtual teaching and learning.</li>
	<li>Business Office staff who manage payroll, benefits, bill payments, receipts and related banking.</li>
	<li>Custodial/Maintenance staff who clean and sterilize our buildings, assist with meal/food preparation and distribution, and collect/distribute supplies to our local hospitals.</li>
	<li>Food service workers who prepare/provide meals/food packages to families in the community.</li>
	<li>District administrators (Central Office and Building Leaders) and Executive Assistants who on a very limited basis, travel to the District to retrieve or send protected materials/documentation that are not available online and are necessary to perform essential responsibilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the safety of our staff and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the Berkley School District will follow the recommendations of the Oakland County Health Division (OCHD) and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) while these employees are at work.  This includes social distancing, increased sanitary standards and screening employees for COVID-19 symptoms before they begin working. </p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Beaumont Health is launching a new initiaitve to honor and recognize all the heath care heroes working together to battle COVID-19: Home Beams for Health Care Teams.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Every evening at 8 p.m., beginning March 31, families are encouraged to step outside their front door and shine a flashlight toward their nearest hospital to show support for health care heroes across Southeast Michigan. Families are also encouraged to swap out their porch light with a blue lightbulb as a sign of support for health care heroes and first responders.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“This pandemic can feel isolating and dark. That’s why we want to brighten the spirits of our health care heroes and also provide community members with opportunities to show support for our incredible health care workers,” Beaumont Health Chief Nursing Officer Susan Grant said. “In addition to continuing to protect our staff and address their needs, we hope these kinds of activities will help reassure our team we’re all in this together.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Home Beams for Health Care Teams” is inspired by Beaumont’s popular annual holiday tradition, “Moonbeams for Sweet Dreams,” which invites families to gather outside Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak and shine flashlights to show support for pediatric patients spending the holidays in hospital.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Beaumont is also asking community members to post videos and pictures on social media of themselves participating in the event. Please tag Beaumont Health and use the hashtag: #HealthCareHeroes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to launching the “Home Beams for Health Care Teams” program, Beaumont also encourages the community to tie blue ribbons around their trees as a sign of support. Volunteers have already tied blue ribbons around trees at the health system’s eight hospital campuses. Beaumont has also ordered Blue Ribbons to provide to people who donate supplies at <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/ELmUwk9jUbp4VAJcu2CWZA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgZIcpP0RgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVhdW1vbnQub3JnL2hlYWx0aC13ZWxsbmVzcy9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9kb25hdGlvbnMtb2YtbWVkaWNhbC1zdXBwbGllcy1hbmQtZXF1aXBtZW50VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAKlTg16iG3_8Uhtqc3RpbGdlckBiZXJrbGV5c2Nob29scy5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">designated drop-off locations</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Beaumont Health launches free online COVID-19 risk assessment tool</strong><br><br>
Beaumont Health launched a free online COVID-19 risk assessment tool today, March 18, which allows patients to answer a series of questions about their symptoms and help them determine whether to stay home or seek medical attention.<br><br>
See the <a href="http://www.beaumont.org/coronavirus" target="_blank">free online risk assessment tool</a> on Beaumont's website.<br><br>
After answering the questions, the online tool will suggest what action a patient should take such as:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Contacting a primary care physician.</span></li>
	<li><span>Going to a curbside screening.</span></li>
	<li><span>Seeking treatment at an emergency center.</span></li>
	<li><span>Staying home and monitoring symptoms.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Many people who become infected with COVID-19 can stay home and treat their symptoms with over the counter medication, unless their symptoms become severe. The primary symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath,” Dr. Nicholas Gilpin, Beaumont Health’s medical director of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, said. “This online risk assessment tool will help our patients better understand what steps they should consider taking if they are not feeling well.”<br><br>
In addition, patients should also consider calling Beaumont’s Coronavirus hotline, 800-592-4784, or their physician’s office before attempting to get screened. If you are experiencing life-threatening symptoms, please call 911.<br><br>
“Everyone does not necessarily need to be tested. Most people who become infected with the disease will not experience complications and will recover. They will just need to go home, rest and take over the counter pain medication,” Dr. Gilpin said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Stay home when you are sick (fever, cough, upper respiratory infection symptoms).</span></li>
	<li><span>Wash your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially before eating, after coughing or sneezing, and after using the bathroom.</span></li>
	<li><span>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</span></li>
	<li><span>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></li>
	<li><span>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re experiencing a life-threatening emergency, call 911 or the number for your local emergency service. Beaumont’s online risk assessment tool provides general information based on interim clinical guidance developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The tool DOES NOT provide diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19. It DOES NOT take into consideration a patient’s complete current condition and medical history. It SHOULD NOT be used as a substitute for the advice of an appropriately qualified and licensed physician or other health care provide, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a medical professional for serious symptoms.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Today we announce a small change to our Meal Distribution program. We do want to be clear that even though the Governor issued a Stay Home, Stay Safe mandate, we are still distributing meals for children 18 and under in our community.

As a result, <strong>starting Monday, April 13, we will be reducing our 4-6 pm pick up location to only Anderson Middle School</strong>. As a reminder, if you need any assistance at all with meals, or if coming to us for meals helps your family in other aspects of daily life, we hope to see you at our centers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today we announce a change to our Meal Distribution program.

In order to reduce contact and keep people home more often, we are moving to a three day distribution schedule. We will be distributing the same amount of meals, just on condensed days. Details on the changes are listed below. As a reminder, if you need any assistance at all with meals, or if coming to us for meals helps your family in other aspects of daily life, we hope to see you at our centers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

        <p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Good Afternoon, Berkley Schools Community,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Over the last two days we have had a surge of families stopping by our meal distribution sites. This is wonderful, because we do not want anyone to go hungry, but it has made us run through our supply quickly. The surge the last two days (nearly double our early week numbers) has caused us to run out of food today. We are very sad to say <strong>we won’t be able to serve the second shift (4-6 pm) today, Friday, March 20.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We will be back in service on Monday, March 23 for both shifts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We believe the surge came because of rumors and incorrect information circulating around the Berkley Schools community. We’d like to clarify a couple points.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
<li>There is a rumor that our meal distribution sites were going to throw out food because we were not having enough people come pick up meals and that food will go to waste. <strong>This is not true. </strong>
</li>
	<li>There is also misinformation that we have enough food for every child in the District ready every day.<strong> This is also not true.</strong> Our focus is to order enough food to feed those who have food insecurity at this time and pad those numbers for extra walk-ups every day.</li>
</ol>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We are happy to help anyone who needs food assistance, but the program is not designed to feed every child in every school, every day. We will not turn down anyone who arrives for our meals, but please understand the focus of this food distribution is for families who truly need assistance.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>For those families who do need food assistance for the weekend and were not able to pick up food today, we encourage you to reach out to <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/VkyEs883w9A4Qv76PK0glQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVkoOP0QVaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2NmYi5vcmcvVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAI4WdV6zHcKrUhtqc3RpbGdlckBiZXJrbGV5c2Nob29scy5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">Gleaners Food Bank</a>, <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/6zjCzpP0o4uCGUuLjWBdxw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVkoOP0QhaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yZ290dGVuaGFydmVzdC5vcmcvVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAI4WdV6zHcKrUhtqc3RpbGdlckBiZXJrbGV5c2Nob29scy5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">Forgotten Harvest</a>, <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/CInUt4T5ZnKEOVSVrvJzfQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVkoOP0QYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueWFkZXpyYS5vcmcvVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAI4WdV6zHcKrUhtqc3RpbGdlckBiZXJrbGV5c2Nob29scy5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">Yad Ezra</a> and <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/nCSlcQ4xZYWJmwUcmPiViw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgVkoOP0QeaHR0cDovL2xpZ2h0aG91c2Vmb29kYmFuay5vcmcvVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAI4WdV6zHcKrUhtqc3RpbGdlckBiZXJrbGV5c2Nob29scy5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">Lighthouse Food Pantry</a>. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Good afternoon, Berkley Schools community,</p>

<p>I hope this week is going well. I continue to be proud of our teachers and the Teaching and Learning staff who have worked tirelessly to identify key learning standards, new methods of teaching and engagement tools all while maintaining classroom communities and relationships with their students. I’m also very proud of our students who are doing great work in our new environment.</p>

<p>Everyone is working hard to get into the swing of our new learning. We understand that each family and each student will be able to engage with the new material differently. We know you will encourage your children to engage with the new materials. We hope our students find comfort in their online communities and a small bit of normalcy in returning to school from a distance, as different as it may feel. We hope your children are finding ways to remotely connect with their friends and check in on one another.</p>

<p>Last week we completed the Continuity of Learning Plan, required under the Governor’s Executive Order. This Plan outlines how Berkley Schools will provide alternative modes of instruction along with a number of other things required in the Governor’s order and subsequent guidance about that order. You can find the plan posted on our new <a href="https://www.berkleyschools.org/about/online-learning-resources/">Online Learning Resources webpage</a>.</p>

<p>I’m happy to share that this new <a href="https://www.berkleyschools.org/about/online-learning-resources/">Online Learning Resources webpage</a> was also completed last week. We created one place for parents to find support for Google Classroom, learning tools that support our curriculum like DreamBox and Lexia, enrichment activities for your family as well as a technology section dedicated to frequently asked questions. We will continue to update this site as we hear feedback from our teachers, technology team, students and you, our community. Please bookmark this webpage as a great place for resources while you navigate online learning.</p>

<p>I hope you are all well and doing your part to help flatten the curve by staying home. For those who have been personally affected by COVID-19, my heart goes out to you. Please know your Berkley Schools family is here to support you.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dennis McDavid<br>
Superintendent<br>
Berkley Schools</p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Good afternoon, Berkley Schools community,</p>

<p>I hope you were able to enjoy some sunshine and warmer weather during this Spring Break. I know this week and weekend will feel different without being able to celebrate Passover and Easter with full family gatherings. I know how important family is during this time of year, and my wish for all of you is to find a way to connect with those your love, whether it’s a phone call, text, video chat or notes in the mail.</p>

<p>Today, I’d also like to share good news. The Berkley School District is proud to announce it is a 2020 Best Community for Music Education! This national designation comes from the NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) Foundation, for its outstanding commitment to music education. Berkley is one of 14 school districts in the state of Michigan to receive the Best Communities for Music Education award, one of 754 nationwide, and has been an award recipient since 2012. <span>Receiving this award for the ninth year in a row is outstanding. I am very proud of our teachers, students, parents, and community supporters of the music program. We are committed to maintaining comprehensive district offerings for our students with programs that reach the whole child, and music education is an integral part.</span></p>

<p>In addition to being proud of this award, I am incredibly proud of our Teaching and Learning team who has been hard at work with teachers this week identifying essential learning standards and lessons for all our students. The team has been creating and completing the Continuous Learning Plan to submit to Oakland Schools, as required in the Governor’s order. The Continuous Learning Plan will outline what new learning will look like for the remainder of the school year. The plan will address the critical pieces of learning that will help students be more prepared for the next grade in the fall. While school won’t feel the same, what’s important about school, the learning and the community, will continue.</p>

<p>Schools are not just about academics. They are about relationships, connections and a sense of belonging. Even though we won’t meet again in our classrooms until the fall, we can still embrace these wonderful attributes about school. Relationships continue with teachers via video and email. Connections with classmates continue with SeeSaw, FlipGrid and more, as well as texting and social media connections. We know the #BerkleyDifference is still alive and well. The #BerkleyDifference is felt in the community as pride for the education and experiences our students receive. It is wanting our students to be well rounded critical thinkers, creative problem solvers, respectful, and have a global perspective, while being explorers of their communities. None of these principles change because we can’t see each other in person. Teachers will be continuing their classroom communities as they have for the past four weeks. They will be working hard to make sure every student is connected and every student feels like they belong in the online community.</p>

<p>Starting next week, we’ll be transitioning away from enrichment materials and into new learning where we haven’t already done that. New learning will look different at different grade levels. It will also look different in every home. Engagement in the lessons will be different family to family and student to student. And, that’s ok. We ask that you do your best and encourage your child(ren) to engage with their teachers and the new materials being presented. You’ll receive a more detailed communication from your building principal early next week.</p>

<p>Parents and guardians, we couldn’t be more grateful for your support during our transition to online learning. Thank you for all you are doing to support your children academically and emotionally, while you continue to work and manage the ever changing information during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><span>As a reminder, please follow the Governor’s Stay Home, Stay Safe order even while the weather improves, wash your hands frequently and remember to take time to decompress every day.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>With gratitude,</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<span class="fa fbcms_ec_titleicon"></span>
</div>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Good Afternoon, Berkley Schools Community,</p>

<p>As I’m sure you have heard, the Governor issued an executive order today officially extending the school building closures through the end of the school year. While this does mean our physical buildings will close, it does not mean that school is over. First and foremost, we want to make sure we are supporting the social and emotional wellness of all our students, staff and parents. We know this pandemic is weighing heavily on all of us, and while learning will continue, school will not feel or look the same as it would in a brick and mortar classroom, and that’s ok.</p>

<p>We know you have a lot of questions like, what does at-home learning look like and how is this different from enrichment, what does this mean for my child’s grades and will we hold extended school during the summer. Please know we cannot answer all of these questions at this very moment, but we have been working hard and will continue to work hard to finalize a plan that is best for all our students. Like you, we are disappointed that our seniors won’t see the end of their final year at Berkley High School in the manner they anticipated. I think this closure is especially hard for them. We feel for all of them and wish the situation were different. But, Class of 2020, you are resilient, you are strong and you make us proud. We will find a way to celebrate you. It may not be in our traditional way, but I trust your BHS leadership team will be thoughtful about how they honor each and every one of you.</p>

<p>The Governor’s executive order is clear that we must continue to offer distance learning through the last day of school - June 12. We are being very mindful that not every household looks the same in our school district, and not everyone has access to technology and/or internet at home. We have distributed over 450 devices to families throughout the District, but we may not have reached everyone. If anyone needs support in this area, please contact your school Principal.  We also know that some of our older students may be caregivers for their siblings and/or neighbors, while parents head into work, performing essential services for our community. We also know that some parents feel better able to support their children with at-home learning than others. There are dozens of other factors that make all of this tough to navigate. That said, we will continue to be mindful that the curriculum we offer is accessible by all to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>Our Principals and Teaching and Learning team are working this week to establish what the pivot to new learning will look like and what standards we will cover. Please be patient with us as we finalize these plans and begin to blend them in when we return from Spring Break.</p>

<p>As you heard from the Governor, no student will be held back because of this pandemic closure. We also want to assure you that no student’s GPA will be negatively affected by these events which are outside of their control. We anticipate that all, or nearly all, of our students will advance a grade next year. We’ll work with our principals, parents and teachers to do the best thing for each student.</p>

<p>Here are other things we know:</p>

<ul>
<li><span> <span>Meal distribution will continue as it has. The State of Michigan applied for a federal waiver to allow meals to be distributed to anyone who needs it, no questions asked.</span></span></li>
	<li><span> <span>Michigan’s 3rd-grade reading law will not be enforced this year. That law recommended that 3rd graders who are behind in reading be retained in 3rd grade based on their M-STEP scores.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>All state tests are suspended for this school year.</span></span></li>
	<li>The Governor’s order confirms our funding will continue through June 30, which allows us to continue to pay our hard working teachers and support staff.<span></span>
</li>
	<li><span><span>Our parents have been outstanding. They are taking up the challenge of keeping their children engaged and learning, many while working from home. We thank you for that. Also remember that your most important role as a parent is to take care of your child. Experts say you should talk with your children about what is happening and listen to what they’re saying. Talk about their fears, their concerns, their worries. Learning can occur in all sorts of ways: cooking, cleaning, playing games, and just living life.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>This learning environment is a transition for our students and our teachers. We know the solutions won’t be perfect, but we will keep our students at the center of all our decision making.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While many days of this pandemic may feel very out of our control, there are things we can control. We can control our ability to follow the Governor’s Stay Home order. We can control how often we wash our hands. We can control how we react to our everyday environment and we can control whether we see this as being stuck at home, or being safe at home. We can control whether we embrace these times with our families and children. We can control our faith in each other and know that we’ll all get through this together.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>I’ll be in touch as we solidify plans for the next phase of the school year.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Please know my heart is with all of you, and I know our Berkley Schools family is resilient and we’ll make the most out of this opportunity to redefine learning together.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p><span>Good afternoon, Berkley Schools Community,</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>We have completed two weeks away from one another and we miss our students tremendously.  Since we last touched base the Governor issued a Stay Home, Stay Safe, Save Lives order. I sincerely hope you are all taking this order seriously - the sooner we all do, the sooner we can return to school. This order means making sure your children are only staying with their immediate family members (and whoever lives in your home) and not heading out to hang out with their friends. I know this is difficult, but we certainly need to all do our part to flatten the COVID-19 curve. If you must go out for essentials, please remember to say 6 feet away from the next person.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>While we miss seeing and working with our students every day, I am so proud of our educators and all they are doing for all of our students. None of this is perfect, but I know that all of us, parents, students and staff, are all doing our best under very trying circumstances. Thanks to all of you for your work and support as we all pull together.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>The Governor’s original school closure order ended April 6. Her Stay Home, Stay Safe order extends through April 13. At this time, Spring Break is included in the state mandate, and will continue as planned Monday, April 6, through Friday, April 10. And it is a break. We will encourage our teachers to connect with students with a hello over the break, however we understand students as well as staff do need a break, and will not be sharing any new enrichment during Spring Break week.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Meal distribution will continue as it currently does during Spring Break. Last week we condensed our meal serving times to help with social and physical distancing. </span>We now serve meals three days a week, <span>and will continue to serve meals during Spring Break. </span>On Mondays and Wednesdays, families will pick up two days worth of meals. On Fridays, families will pick up three days worth of meals. Meal distribution times remain the same: 11 am - 1 pm and 4-6 pm. Both meals will be available during both time slots. Meals will be distributed in a grab-and-go style pick up and families will take both meals per child at the same time. The meals (1 breakfast and 1 lunch) are available to any child in the community 18 and under, no questions asked. Our meal distribution sites are Anderson Middle School (3205 Catalpa, Berkley, MI) with pick up at the back parking lot door and Norup International School (14450 Manhattan, Oak Park, MI) with pick up at the multi-purpose room doors.</p>

<p>Previous messages have included links to resources for academic enrichment more related to core subjects. This week, I’d like to share enriching experiences for you to enjoy with your family.</p>

<p><span>I am so proud of our community and how we have all come together to lift one another. Just last week, our custodial maintenance staff took inventory and corralled 176 canisters of Clorox wipes, 93 individual bottles of hand sanitizer, 225 boxes of gloves and 16 masks to donate to Beaumont Health. Our custodial and maintenance staff are a vital part of the team every day of every year. In this time they have answered the call by finding much-needed supplies to donate from our District supply closet and each schools’ supply. Over the course of the closure our dedicated food staff has distributed over 1,700 meals. Elementary parents are still holding virtual March is Reading Month activities, our kids are writing encouraging messages in sidewalk chalk and this week BHS and AMS are hosting a virtual Spirit Week. These are the moments to focus on at this time - the little things that bring smiles to our faces and show the positive spirit of our Berkley Schools community.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>I’d like to close by sharing a poem our BHS Principal Andy Meloche wrote, as a tribute to the senior class. We know this is a particularly difficult time for our seniors, and Mr. Meloche wanted his students to know how much he, and the entire BHS staff, cares about them. I hope you enjoy the poem as much as I did.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><strong>An Ode to My Wonderful Seniors</strong></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span>To the senior class of two thousand and twenty,<br>
the last several weeks must feel like swimming upstream.</span></span><span><span><br>
The COVID-19 interrupted your study,</span></span><span><span><br>
and to make matters worse, you became quarantined.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span>Your high school years have had nothing but turbulence,</span></span><span><span><br>
as you’ve braved both the familiar and the unknown.</span></span><span><span><br>
Each of you, I know, has incredible substance;</span></span><span><span><br>
enduring, courageous while achieving milestones.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span>And now you are seniors, your best year has derailed,</span></span><span><span><br>
many cancelled events, there’s been such a high cost.</span></span><span><span><br>
Regardless of what happens, I know you’ll prevail.</span></span><span><span><br>
It is not yet the time to think everything is lost.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span>You’ve lived in times that will be studied by scholars,</span></span><span><span><br>
persisting to achieve much greatness together.</span></span><span><span><br>
Integrity, distinction, kindness and honor;</span></span><span><span><br>
and being your leader has been such a pleasure.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span>So stick with each other, look out for your classmates;</span></span><span><span><br>
love one another as you have done since day one.</span></span><span><span><br>
I know that falling apart will not be your fate.</span></span><span><span><br>
At the end of this mess, like always, you’ll have won.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><span>Written by your Principal, Mr. Meloche</span></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span><em><span>*Twelve syllables per line to represent the 12th grade.*</span></em></span><span><em><span><br>
*Five stanzas, four lines each, equals twenty lines to represent the class of 2020.*</span></em></span><span><em><span><br>
*There are three-hundred and fourteen syllables on this page, one for each senior.*</span></em></span></p>

<p><span><em><span></span></em></span></p>

<p><span><span>Stay safe, stay healthy and be kind everyone.</span></span></p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Good afternoon, Berkley Schools families,</p>

<p>I hope you are all doing well as we adjust to our new normal.  While the information regarding COVID-19 is still moving at a rapid pace, what has not changed is our commitment to you, the Berkley Schools community.</p>

<p>Our teachers have been working diligently this past week sharing content and enrichment with their students. The method of contact may look different for each teacher at the elementary level, but will be through Google Classroom for most secondary classes. If you haven’t connected with your child’s teacher(s), we encourage you to do so early this week. They miss their students and would love to hear from each and every one of them.  Staying connected online and continuing to learn will help all of us get through this time.  We know that online enrichment and learning is not ideal. We’d all rather be in the classroom working together.  Please know that our teachers and staff have been fantastic throughout this and will continue to do their best to reach and meaningfully connect with every student. It won’t be perfect, but it will be the best that we can do given the circumstances. Thanks to all of you for your support, encouragement, patience and understanding.</p>

<p><span>You may have seen the news coverage that the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) stated that the online enrichment and learning activities won’t count toward the school year.  We understand this may cause some confusion.  My read on this is that the MDE is saying that they can not legally waive the law which mandates the number of hours and days that school is in session.  Only the legislature can change this with a bill that is then signed by the Governor.  We have been working with and will continue to work with our legislators to impact these decisions.</span></p>

<p>At the Administrative Offices, we have moved to virtual offices at our homes.  You may see cars in the parking lot occasionally, as we stop in for supplies, to process payroll and a quick (socially distanced) connection to each other.  <span>All staff will continue to be available by email at this time.  If you need to reach someone at the Administrative Offices, you can email anyone through the website.  Here is a <a href="https://www.berkleyschools.org/about/departments/">link to our online staff directory</a>.  We will continue to monitor recommendations and guidance from the State of Michigan and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and will modify our work plan as needed.</span></p>

<h2><span>Food Service Update</span></h2>

<p><span>Our food service partner, Aramark, has been outstanding the last week preparing and distributing food for students in the community. While we know we’ll encounter bumps in the road, we are grateful to our food service staff for working so hard to get food into the hands of those who need it most.  To view our meal distribution schedule, <a href="https://www.berkleyschools.org/about/covid-19/">visit our website</a>.  As a clarification, we are working to understand the need in the community for daily meals.  If you need any assistance at all with meals, or if coming to us for meals helps your family in other aspects of daily life, we hope to see you at our centers.  We order food based on the demand, and are careful to not over-purchase.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<h2><span>Technology Update</span></h2>

<p><span>As you navigate online learning with your children, we wanted to share how to access your child’s Google log in. If you are unsure how to find it, follow the steps below.</span></p>

<p><strong><span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Elementary -</span></strong><span> In the <a href="https://mistar.oakland.k12.mi.us/berkley/parentportal/">MISTAR Parent Portal</a>, under Network Login, you’ll see your child’s username and password. </span></p>

<p><strong><span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Secondary - </span></strong><span>If your child is unsure of their username and password, please email the building’s media specialist to have the password reset.  At BHS this is Martha Spear, at AMS, Maureen Watson and at Norup, Theresa Savich.</span></p>

<h2><span><strong>COVID-19 Updates</strong></span></h2>

<p><span>We want to make sure our community is following the guidelines set forth by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/checklist.html">CDC</a> for children and teenagers: <em>Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community</em>. This is even more true now that the Governor has issued a Stay Home, Stay Safe, mandate. You may have also noticed caution tape around our playgrounds. The virus lives on the playground surfaces for quite some time and it’s hard to disinfect the play structures. Because of this, the Governor also ordered the closure of all playgrounds. We encourage you to get outside and go for a walk/run/bike ride, play in your backyard, create an obstacle course with sidewalk chalk, get silly with <a href="https://www.gonoodle.com/">Go Noodle</a>, etc.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>We are a Beaumont Health community partner, so you may see updates from Beaumont Health via Berkley Schools over the course of the COVID-19 situation.  Recent updates from Beaumont shared their <a href="http://www.beaumont.org/coronavirus">free online assessment tool for COVID-19 symptoms</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.beaumont.org/health-wellness/press-releases/beaumont-health-requests-donations-of-medical-supplies-equipment">request for medical supplies</a>. If you would like to see any messages we’ve sent out so far during the COVID-19 pandemic, please <a href="https://www.berkleyschools.org/about/covid-19/">visit our website</a> where you’ll see learning resources as well as all communications.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Thanks, as always, for your support and for pulling together during this unique time to support one another and our community.</span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p><span><span><span><span><span>Good afternoon, Berkley Schools families,</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Thank you to our Berkley Schools community for your ongoing patience, kind words and positive mindset as we navigate these uncharted waters together.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today we are checking in with resources for your family to explore learning from home. We miss all our students and hope that learning and enrichment occurs every day. We know it’s hard to navigate the internet with thousands of choices for “free online learning” resources, so we’ve narrowed down the list for you. You should also hear from your child’s teacher(s) this week for guidance on learning specific to their grade and subject level as well.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We also know that you and your child may be anxious about what the next weeks will bring. Below we have linked resources on how to talk to your children about the COVID-19 outbreak and strategies to help ease anxiety.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We will post all of these resources on our </span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.berkleyschools.org/about/covid-19/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>COVID-19 website</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span> as well as any update we send your way.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a reminder, </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>it seems safe to say many members of our communities may have had exposure to the COVID-19 virus, based on how quickly it is spreading. Take care of yourself and your family, stay away from crowded spaces (including playgrounds), rethink playdates, watch your symptoms and see a doctor if you or your family member have symptoms similar to the flu. By physically distancing ourselves from one another, we can </span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>help flatten the curve</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span> of the rate of infection.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Lastly, we have a plan in place, in coordination with our food service partner Aramark, to distribute food to any children in our community, no questions asked. Today we began distributing two meals a day (breakfast and lunch) for any child under 18 in our community. Here are the important details you need to know:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span class="fa fbcms_ec_titleicon"></span>
</div>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Dear Berkley Schools families,</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience as we work through details of what the next four weeks will look like. This has been a long week for all of us with information regarding the coronavirus, COVID-19, changing on an hourly basis. As you know, the Governor closed all K-12 school districts last night. Berkley School District will be closed through Spring Break, with classes scheduled to resume on Monday, April 13. This closure also includes all programs at Berkley Building Blocks. We know you all have many questions about what this closure will look like, what services we will provide and what learning your child will be encouraged to complete. We will address the following topics below: Home Learning, Food Distribution, Child Care, Spring Break, Student Services and Technology.</p>

<p><strong>Home Learning</strong></p>

<p>In our District, we offer a broad range of services to a broad range of students. There is no way to replicate what happens in our classrooms via the internet. However, we want learning to continue while we’re closed and we hope you’ll join us in encouraging your children to engage with enriching activities. Our expectations for learning are as follows. Monday and Tuesday, March 16 and 17, will be treated as snow days. During those two days, teachers will be preparing communications and online learning for your child. On Wednesday, you or your child should receive a communication from your teacher(s) about what learning we will be encouraging on a daily and weekly basis. You should know that we will not be assigning work for grades. We will instead be encouraging learning, reading, thinking and a review of skills.</p>

<p>Secondary students will be getting a lot of information via Google classroom. We encourage you to know your child’s login and password and that you are able to see the learning right alongside with them. In addition, the third card marking is now closed. Assignments and grades will be posted in the future.</p>

<p>We are choosing to not give required assignments during this period of closure in order to ensure our students have equitable access to the work and that we are not punishing any student for how this closure impacts their family.</p>

<p><strong>Food Distribution</strong></p>

<p>We understand that closing schools may result in hardship for some of our families who require food assistance. Working with our food service partner Aramark, we have a plan in place. Beginning Monday, March 16 we will be distributing two meals a day (breakfast and lunch) for any child under 18 in our community. Here are the important details you need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meal distribution sites:
	<ul>
<li>Anderson Middle School (3205 Catalpa, Berkley, MI). Pick up at the back parking lot door (behind the building).</li>
		<li>Norup International School (14450 Manhattan, Oak Park, MI). Pick up at the multi-purpose room doors.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Meal distribution times:
	<ul>
<li>11 am - 1 pm <strong>and</strong> 4-6 pm</li>
		<li>Both meals will be available during both time slots. There is no need to come twice.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Meals will be distributed in a grab-and-go style pick up.</li>
	<li>Families will take both meals per child at the same time.</li>
	<li>On Fridays, families will be able to take enough meals for the weekend for each child.</li>
	<li>The meals (1 breakfast and 1 lunch) are available to any child in the community, no questions asked.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know there is also a suggestion in the community to form a food pantry. We appreciate everyone raising their hand to help with this endeavor, and are still working through what this will look like. In the meantime, if families need further food assistance, we encourage you to reach out to Gleaners Food Bank, Forgotten Harvest and Yad Ezra.</p>

<p><strong>Child Care and Preschool</strong></p>

<p>Berkley Building Blocks will also be closing all programs March 16 through April 12, including Kids’ Zone. We understand this closure may provide a hardship for families. We are closing because we know we will not have enough staff members in attendance to stay in compliance with state licensing, the Michigan Department of Education closed the Great Start Readiness Program and the Oakland County Health Division shared that closing child care facilities will help stop the spread of the virus. We will offer credits and refunds for all tuition programs at BBB as well as Kids’ Zone for the times we are closed.</p>

<p><strong>Spring Break &amp; School Calendar</strong></p>

<p>As of right now, we will keep Spring Break slated for April 6-10. We cannot predict where the virus will spread and don’t feel it prudent to change future calendar items at this time. If we do decide to move Spring Break into the same window as the Governor’s recommendation, we will be in touch. We do not have guidance yet from the Michigan Department of Education on whether the school year will be extended. When we receive this guidance, we will be in touch.</p>

<p><strong>Student Services</strong></p>

<p>As stated earlier, we offer a broad range of services to a broad range of students and there is no way to replicate what happens in our classrooms via the internet. We know there are concerns about IEPs, accommodations and if services will be available for students with special needs. We don’t have all the answers to these questions at this moment, but know we are continually communicating with county, state and federal organizations to see how to best navigate these waters.</p>

<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>

<p>Today we sent home hundreds of devices with our students who <a href="https://forms.gle/Qi8C77B1Bsh576m79">indicated on our survey</a> that they did not have access to one at home. If you have not taken the survey, please do so. We will do our best to distribute devices to students who do not have access to one at home. We are also working to establish internet access for those who do not have access. Comcast has released a<a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/national/coronavirus/comcast-offering-internet-essentials-package-free-for-60-months-during-coronavirus-outbreak?fbclid=IwAR3AwfB1UPmdMt4cAuUMxulD0TPoQRT5Yqu_ak1jjtLHpU4qw_UJ6bROg7U"> new Internet Essentials package</a> for free for 60 days for those who are interested.</p>

<p>While you may see cars in the parking lots for the next week, please know our buildings are closed to the public.</p>

<p>We will update our school community as additional information becomes available. In the meantime, we ask all families to exercise universal precautions whenever possible. It seems safe to say many members of our communities may have had exposure to the COVID-19 virus, based on how quickly it spreads. Take care of yourself and your family, stay away from crowded spaces, watch your symptoms and see a doctor if you or your family member have symptoms similar to the flu.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.berkleyschools.org/about/covid-19/">Visit our website</a> for a list of resources and health advisory statements for any questions regarding COVID-19.</p>

<p>Thank you for your trust and faith in the Berkley Schools. I know we’ll get through this together as a community.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dennis McDavid<br>
Superintendent<br>
Berkley Schools</p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p>Dear Berkley Schools families,</p>

<p>At 11 pm on Thursday, March 12, the Governor announced a state-wide school closure from Monday, March 16 through Sunday, April 5. As you know, our Spring Break is scheduled for Monday, April 6 through Friday, April 10. Berkley Schools will resume Monday, April 13. </p>

<p>Berkley Schools will be in session on Friday, March 13 for an orderly dismissal. Staff will report to provide a full day of instruction. This will also allow students to bring home books, supplies, instruments, etc. to prepare for learning while away from our buildings. We understand you may wish to keep your children home; tomorrow will be as flexible as possible as we prepare for the long closure. Berkley Building Blocks will also be open tomorrow, March 13.</p>

<p>We will send you more details tomorrow regarding future learning opportunities, what the next month may look like and how we’re working to provide meals to our families who need it.</p>

<p>I will be in touch.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dennis McDavid</p>

        <p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Dear Berkley Schools Community,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I write to you this afternoon to try to offer some of my perspective as we work through a very difficult time as a community, state and nation.  As I write this I know that many of you are anxious, worried and afraid of where we are right now.  I share those concerns.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We continue to take direction on this issue from the Oakland County Health Division (OCHD), the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) and the Governor's office.  All of these agencies have, as of this writing, continued to tell us that schools should remain in session, while also giving contradictory advice that all of us in society should limit gatherings to 100 or fewer people.  Schools, almost by definition, are gatherings of more than 100 people.  I believe that these professionals are doing their best to give advice and guidance in a situation that is fast moving and unlike any other event in recent history.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I have reached out to superintendents in other states to learn from them.  These states have more confirmed COVID-19 cases than we have in Michigan and they have been dealing with the situation longer.  I am trying to learn from them and their experiences.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I am meeting regularly with other Oakland County Superintendents and the Oakland County Schools leadership team.  We are all trying to work together to glean the best information.  I was in a meeting this morning with the Medical Director of OCHD.  He briefed me and other district superintendents on the situation, but didn't reveal any more information than is publicly available.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As a school district we continue to plan for the possibility that we will have to close schools for some time, but hope that we won't.  You have probably seen that some districts around us closed for a day or two to plan in case they have to close their schools. We haven't done that for a couple of reasons. First many of our teachers already post lessons, videos and other learning material online.  Additionally, if we were to close we would take the first day or two of that closing to give our teachers the time necessary for planning together.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As we plan for a possible closing there are all kinds of issues that we are working through.  These include everything from understanding which students don't have internet access or a computer at home (<a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/7cXm-5eMe0aCNU6Nxu6e8g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgS8ESP0QjaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3Jtcy5nbGUvaTJhdjFyVVdScm9LTGRRTThXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAko1qXgZZuzJSIkplc3NpY2EuU3RpbGdlckBiZXJrbGV5c2Nob29scy5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">please take our online access survey</a> if you have not done so yet), how to feed students who depend on school for two meals a day, how to realistically teach elementary students remotely, how do we support students with special needs, etc.  These issues and concerns go on and on.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As we continue to plan, I am urging you to also plan in case closing schools becomes necessary.  I am also letting you know that if you have medically fragile people at home, or you believe your children should not be in school, or you or your children feel sick at all, please stay home.  Absences will be treated as excused and our teachers will do their best to get the work to your children.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I also want you to know that I have received a number of emails from you and I deeply appreciate your concern and support.  For those who are urging a different course of action, I certainly understand your perspective.  This is a complex situation and fast moving for which there is no playbook.  We'll continue to do our best, relying on the guidance of our public health officials and others.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I know this is a difficult time for all of us.  I also know that if we stick together, believe in each other and support one another we'll get through it.

        <p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Dear Berkley Schools Community,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Thank you for your patience while we work through the ever changing landscape of the Coronavirus COVID-19. Yesterday Governor Whitmer addressed the state of Michigan with a recommended plan to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Her message was clear - Michiganders should do everything they can to help stop the spread of this virus including practicing recommended hygiene protocols (wash your hands, cough into your sleeve, stay home if you are sick and stay away from large gatherings of people). She was also clear that at this point K-12 schools should stay open, but work to mitigate risk.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Governor announced <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/aczcAguE6tQdFinfdDUVeQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgS5aZP0RsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljaGlnYW4uZ292L2RvY3VtZW50cy9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9NREhIU19JbnRlcmltX1JlY29tbWVuZGF0aW9uc19mb3JfQ09WSUQtMTlfZmluYWxfNjgzNTg5XzcucGRmVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAABljal5FWKhoUhtqc3RpbGdlckBiZXJrbGV5c2Nob29scy5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">community mitigation strategies</a> for schools, businesses, universities and more. Under the guidance from the Governor and the Oakland County Health Division, Berkley Schools will remain in session. However, <strong>beginning today, Thursday, March 12, </strong>we are invoking recommended social distancing practices.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>The following after-school activities and large gathering events are now cancelled through Spring Break:</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Concerts and student performances that involve the general public</li>
	<li>School family nights and dances</li>
	<li>Assemblies and visits with outside guests</li>
	<li>All community meetings, rentals, and gatherings scheduled to take place within our school facilities. This includes scheduled PTA events or meetings, parent meetings and all facility rentals.</li>
	<li>Parent/teacher conferences. Families are encouraged to connect with teachers if you would like to have a phone conference or email update regarding questions or concerns you have for your child.

</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>The following activities, events and programs will continue:</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Kids’ Zone Latchkey</li>
	<li>Berkley Building Blocks</li>
	<li>BEF enrichment programs taught by Berkley Schools teachers</li>
	<li>High School athletic competitions. We will look to the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) for ongoing guidance and connect with families if their current guidance changes.</li>
	<li>Any after-school activity that meets at our school buildings, in a small group and is an extension of the normal learning day (clubs, athletic practices, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Our immediate plan for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in our community is based on three factors:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
<li>Avoiding unnecessary exposure of our staff and students to illness</li>
	<li>Working to the best of our ability to ensure the continuity of teaching and learning</li>
	<li>Protecting the health and well-being of our community, especially those who are most vulnerable to illness</li>
</ol>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to the measures listed above, out of an abundance of caution and for the safety of our community, we are limiting access to our buildings. Considering the health implications of visiting our schools, we are encouraging individuals not to come into the building unless necessary. While we take great pride in the level of participation from our families and residents, now is the time to err on the side of caution.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As we prepare for all possible scenarios, we are asking you to also think through a plan for your family in the event schools were to close for an extended period of time.

Remember—frequent hand washing, staying home when you are sick, and practicing good hygiene are the best ways to stay healthy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We want to provide you with the resources you need to be smart and safe. We are a community school district. We rely on our community to support us and work with us. We’ll continue to follow recommended guidelines to help protect the greater community and those most vulnerable to COVID-19.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>While we want to make sure that our families are informed and prepared, we know that this has impacted our students in varying ways. Here are some steps you can take at home to address any concerns your child(ren) may have:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Correct misinformation for them</li>
	<li>Focus on what kids can do to keep themselves healthy</li>
	<li>Acknowledge your own fears, but keep them in perspective</li>
	<li>Don't dismiss their fears. Acknowledge that fear is healthy, and help them manage it appropriately.</li>
	<li>Preview changes or disruptions that may happen, like school closures</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As things evolve and we learn more about the recommendations of health experts at the county, state and federal level we will communicate with all students, staff, and community members via social media, the <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/pSzZ5NilYXcpOAQeOQFPMQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgS5aZP0QuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVya2xleXNjaG9vbHMub3JnL2Fib3V0L2NvdmlkLTE5L1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAAAZY2peRVioaFIbanN0aWxnZXJAYmVya2xleXNjaG9vbHMub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">district’s website</a>, and our email notification system. We will send another update by end of day tomorrow.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As we said yesterday, this is a fluid situation and we know the road ahead may be uncharted, but working together, we’ll get through it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="fbcms_richtext_content">
        <p><span><span><span><span><span>Dear Berkley Schools Community,</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>By now, I’m sure you have heard that Oakland County has a confirmed case of the Coronavirus, or COVID-19. </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Although we anticipated the virus would eventually make its way to Michigan, we know that the news is concerning to all of us.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>I wanted to touch base with everyone about the steps we are taking and planning as we await more details from the Oakland County Health Division.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since my last message, we have taken some action in our buildings. These include increasing the frequency </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>our building custodians use electrostatic sprayers that sanitize surfaces quickly, cancelling international travel, as well as following the Governor’s guidance and recommending that parents do not shake hands at high school parent/teacher conferences. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We have also been working with our administrative team to plan for the “what ifs” of potential school closures, event and performance cancellations, online learning and more. We are working on logistics for every possible scenario. We are concerned about every child and staff and lost learning opportunities especially for those students who may not have internet connectivity at home. We are also thinking through online learning for our elementary aged children and how this may differ from our secondary students. As we prepare for these scenarios, which we hope and pray we don’t have to implement, we are asking you to also think through a plan for your family in the event schools were to close. To be clear, if we were to close schools, it would be in consultation with the Oakland County Health Division.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Our focus is prevention, education and providing you with the resources you need to be smart and safe—but not to panic. We know from the data that children appear to be in the lowest risk group for COVID-19 and virtually every child who contracted the virus worldwide had a very mild case and recovered quickly. Regardless, the Governor has declared a state of emergency, we are taking COVID-19 very seriously and hope that with your help, we can stop the spread of this virus here in our area. Remember—frequent hand washing, staying home when you are sick and good hygiene practices are the best way to keep the virus away.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a reminder, here are important resources for you and your family.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Out of an abundance of caution and to mitigate risk, we are cancelling Parent/Teacher conferences scheduled for tonight and tomorrow (afternoon and evening). <strong>Tomorrow, Thursday, March 12, will now be a full day of school for all BHS students.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>With safety as our number one priority and with the COVID-19 virus now in our county, we feel it prudent to practice social distancing.

Berkley Schools will remain in close contact with and follow guidance from the Oakland County Health Division, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding any new developments.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The best way to prevent the spread of any illness - including the common cold and the flu - is to keep sick children home. The CDC also recommends the following:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (the time it takes to sing the ABCs). If soap and water are unavailable, use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with individuals who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home when you are sick. The CDC recommends that individuals remain home for at least 24 hours after you no longer have a fever or signs of a fever (e.g., chills, feeling warm, flushed appearance). <strong>For our students,</strong> it is our policy to have students stay home until they are fever free for 24 hours without the aid of a fever-reducing medication.</li>
	<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or sneeze into your arm.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
	<li>Take any anti-viral medication prescribed to you as instructed by your doctor.</li>
