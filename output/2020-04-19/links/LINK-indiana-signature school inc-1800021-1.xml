<h2>IB statement on May 2020 DP and CP examinations</h2>
<p>Our students, their well-being and their progression in future stages of life have been at the forefront of our thinking as we respond to this extraordinary pandemic.</p>
<p>As an organization, it is critical for us to ensure that the options we provide for our IB community, students and teachers are fair and compassionate during these difficult circumstances. We want to thank you for your patience and consideration. As a result, the IB with considerable advisement from stakeholders across the globe including schools, students, universities and official bodies have tried to determine the most responsible and ethical way forward.</p>
<p>The IB has put into place the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DP and CP examinations scheduled between 30 April and 22 May will no longer be held. <br><br>
</li>
<li>The student will be awarded either the Diploma, Career-related Programme certificate or a course certificate which reflects their standard of work. The achievement will be based around the students’ coursework and the established assessment expertise, rigor and quality control already built into the programmes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see below our initial set of FAQs. We will continue to update these weekly.</p>
<p>We know that schools and candidates registered for May 2020 session will have many questions and we will continue to be available to answer questions. Our goal continues to be to find ways to support our global community during these uncertain times and provide the best possible outcomes for our students.</p>
<p>These FAQs provide information about key topics such as assessment deadlines and school authorization. If you are part of an IB World school faculty and require further support, please contact <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a><a id="school-closures"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>School closures</h2>
<p><strong>Due to COVID-19 (Coronavirus), schools are currently closed in many countries across the world. The IB is monitoring the situation closely.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am a student, and my school is closed due to COVID-19 (Coronavirus)—what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>If your school is closed, please contact your coordinator or head of school. The IB is communicating regularly with schools that have been impacted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What should we do if our school is not in one of the affected areas, but we do have candidates who travelled into one of the affected countries and, as a result, have been unable to return to lessons at the school?</strong></p>
<p>We ask that schools with impacted candidates contact the IB’s Adverse Circumstances team at <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am unable to return to my school because of travel restrictions — what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Please contact your coordinator or head of school. There are options available for students to keep up with their education, including transferring to another IB World School or completing presentations and oral assessments virtually.<a id="results"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>How will the results be calculated?</strong></p>
<p>We will be using vast historical assessment data to ensure that we follow a rigorous process of due diligence in what is a truly unprecedent situation. We will be undertaking significant data analysis from previous exam sessions, individual school data, subject data as well as comparative data of schools who have already completed uploading requirements and those who have not.</p>
<p>We will require schools to submit the coursework for all candidates. We will externally mark work that is usually marked by teachers, instead of taking samples and applying moderation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the IB be awarding a diplomas and certificates this year?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will a student be awarded an IB Diploma or Certificate?</strong></p>
<p>We will award each student a grade for each of their registered subjects using a calculation that takes into account their coursework marks and their predicted grade, as submitted to the IB by their school. For most components we will externally mark work that is usually marked by teachers, instead of taking samples and applying moderation.</p>
<p>Will students be awarded a Diploma, numerical grade for each subject, the core and overall?<br>We will be awarding Diplomas and Certificates for the May 2020 session. At a subject level, students will be awarded a grade on the normal IB 1-7 scale. Theory of Knowledge (TOK), the Extended Essay and the Career-Related Programme Reflective Project will be awarded a grade on the normal IB A-E scale. The DP core will be awarded on the normal IB 0-3 scale. A total points score will be awarded for the Diploma, out of 45 as normal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When will results be released?</strong></p>
<p>The IB intends to release results to universities/institutions and schools as planned on 5 July 2020.<br>All student coursework and associated predicted grades will need to be uploaded by 20 April, if not sooner, in order to guarantee delivery of results by 5 July.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Some students perform better in exam conditions than coursework, how can we be sure they are not at a disadvantage?</strong></p>
<p>We will use a calculation that is based on the relationship between coursework marks, predicted grades and subject grades to estimate the subject grades candidates would have received if the exams had gone ahead. If the relationship between these elements shows that in previous sessions candidates globally tended to achieve higher outcomes on their exams than their coursework, the calculation used this session will reflect that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Might we see some students awarded DP/CP and course certificates if they have not completed their coursework?</strong></p>
<p>The fairest results are achieved by the candidate completing and submitting all the assessment tasks. If further extensions are granted, there may be a delay in the issue of results for a candidate or school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens with the grades obtained in the anticipated session (May 2019) - will the certificate reflect that the grade includes the May 2019 exams?</strong></p>
<p>The grades achieved within the anticipated session will be reflected in the certificate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I am an anticipated candidate this session will my grade count towards my final award?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the grade you receive this session will count towards your final Diploma or Career-related Programme certificate in the usual way. As usual you will also be able to retake your anticipated subject in future sessions, if the subjects are available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will we be able to submit an Enquiry Upon Result (EUR) if students are not happy with the results?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, schools will be able to submit EURs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will students be able to appeal their results?</strong></p>
<p>Schools will be able to access the Enquiry Upon Results and Appeals services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I retake the exam if I am unhappy with the result?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, students will be able to retake in a future session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>'Request for Results Service' deadline is 1 May for all the countries apart from Canada and USA. Is this going to be extended?</strong></p>
<p>The deadline has been extended to 15 June and requests can be accepted up to 4 July 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What IB grades should we add to our school-based report cards which are issued before the IB Diploma or Career-related Programme certificate? Predicted ones?</strong></p>
<p>We rely on your expertise as a school. Universities know schools and their track records well. We care about IB students and we know you can determine what is important for you to share with universities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I request the legalization service? Can I still submit a request to have my results certification legalized?</strong></p>
<p>In some countries, the IB certification needs to be legalized by the relevant chancellery, embassy and/or consulate to be valid for entrance to universities. As most of these offices and institutions are closed as a result of COVID-19 (Coronavirus), the IB Legalization service has temporarily been suspended. The situation will be monitored closely, and normal service will be resumed as soon as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How should we prepare our predicted grades and should we take into consideration the additional assessments or the fact that there won't be an exam?</strong></p>
<p>Teachers should predict grades in the usual way, as though the exams were still taking place. Please refer to section B3.3.2 of the DP Assessment Procedures/B3.3.3 of the CP Assessment Procedures.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Predicted Grades</h3>
<p><strong>How should we predict grades this session?</strong></p>
<p>Teachers should predict grades in the usual way, as though the exams were still taking place. A predicted grade should be based on all the evidence of the candidate’s work and the teacher’s knowledge of IB standards. For more information please refer to section B3.2.3 of the DP Assessment Procedures/B3.3.3 of the CP Assessment Procedures.</p>
<p>For the May 20 session we are using historical data at a school level as part of the calculation of final grades so it is important that each prediction is made as accurately as possible, without under-predicting or over-predicting the grade. Predicted grades will continue to play a role in grade awarding processes. We will monitor for changes in predicted grades this year during our quality control process by comparing the predictions in past examination sessions. Anomalies identified such as over-predicting will be thoroughly reviewed and could be treated as a potential case of school maladministration. It is the responsibility of the school to ensure that IB rules and regulations are adhered to. For further reference on possible actions taken by the IB in such cases, please refer to the publication <a href="/contentassets/76d2b6d4731f44ff800d0d06d371a892/academic-integrity-policy-english.pdf">Academic integrity</a> <a href="/globalassets/news-assets/coronavirus/coronavirus-outbreak-faq-en.pdf"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/globalassets/file-type-icons/ib_icon_pdf.svg" alt="pdf" height="20"></a> [3.1 MB]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What scale should I use when predicting grades for this session?</strong></p>
<p>Teachers predicting grades should continue to use the following scales, as in any other examination session.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grades are awarded to candidates in each subject on a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 being the highest grade.<br><br>
</li>
<li>For the CP reflective project (RP), TOK and the EE, the grades are on a scale of A to E, with A being the highest grade.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Should I issue a predicted grade for all subjects?</strong></p>
<p>No, a predicted grade is not required for language A: literature SL school supported self-taught candidates because students are not taught by a teacher within your school for these subjects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Should I share the predicted grade with candidates and their parents/guardians?</strong></p>
<p>Whether predicted grades should be released to candidates is left to the school and their own policy on predicated grades. The IB would recommend that the predicted grade is a matter between the school and the IB. Schools and teachers must be free from undue pressure when signing off predicted grades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do I submit predicted grades?</strong></p>
<p>Please submit in the usual way. Full instructions are given in the library section of IBIS in the ‘internal assessment and predicted grade user guide’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will the predicted grades be used this session?</strong></p>
<p>Candidates who are registered in May 20 will receive a calculated subject grade. The calculated grade process will consider a range of evidence including the coursework marks, predicted grades and historical grade distributions for a school and for the overall subject on a global level. This will involve a standard setting exercise to ensure that global standards are maintained for each subject.</p>
<p>Predicted grades will continue to be used for grade award meetings when considering a subject’s grade distributions and the performance of individual candidates.<a id="examinations"></a></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Examinations and fees</h2>
<p>The IB has put into place the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DP and CP examinations scheduled between 30 April and 22 May will no longer be held.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The student will be awarded either a diploma or a course certificate which reflects their standard of work. The achievement will be based around the students’ coursework and the established assessment expertise, rigor and quality control already built into the programmes.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Have exams been canceled before?</strong></p>
<p>No. Like many other examination bodies, this is an unprecedented situation. For the IB, this is the first time that we have had to cancel an exam session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In cases where schools will be open and candidates wish to take their exams, will the IB send exams?</strong></p>
<p>No. We have consulted widely and many schools and school systems around the world have been closed or are closing to contain the pandemic. Further, the IB is an international qualification that assures that no matter where the student is from, they can be assessed globally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is this going to impact the November 2020 exam session in any way?</strong></p>
<p>At this time, we believe the November 2020 exam session will proceed as scheduled. We want to do right by students. If current May session students would like to sit exams in the November session, we would welcome it, and therefore we are prepared for that eventuality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are there extensions for registration into the November 2020 session?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working through this and will provide an update as soon as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can anticipated students from M21 take their exams in November 2020?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently considering this and will update this answer when we have more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am an anticipated candidate this session, will I still receive a grade?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, anticipated candidates will be treated like all other candidates this year and will be awarded a grade based on the work submitted to the IB.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I am an anticipated candidate this session will my grade count towards my final diploma?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the grade you receive this session will count towards your final Diploma in the usual way. As usual you will also be able to retake your anticipated subject in future sessions, if the subjects are available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I defer to the November session to sit exams?</strong><br>Yes, if the subjects are available. Any student who has not received enough teaching has the option to defer to a subsequent session for some or all the assessments, free of charge. For advice on supporting teaching and learning, please contact your IB World School Manager directly or <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will this count as a session under the three-session rule?</strong></p>
<p>No, this session will not count as a session for the three-session rule.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My student does not want to defer to the November exam session due to university admissions deadlines. What are my student’s options?</strong></p>
<p>Students should discuss their options with their DP/CP coordinator and university admissions officers. The IB is communicating with universities globally about the current situation and will continue to do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if some students cannot complete course work due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>We will be relying on this coursework completion to issue results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the IB refund fees (including exam fees and inquiry upon results fees), adjust the registration fee rules, or cancel alternative venue requests?</strong></p>
<p>We will provide more information to all finance questions raised in due course. The IB’s primary focus of activity currently is to provide a valid and reliable mechanism to ensure students can be awarded the Diploma, Career-related Programme certificate or course certificates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are the assessment criteria going to be changed, e.g.: ‘will there be any flexibility in terms of the minimum number of pieces required for the exhibition of the visual arts students?</strong></p>
<p>The IB will not change the criteria it assesses or the work that is required to be submitted for assessment. Where an activity is not assessed, for example, the DP visual arts or MYP personal project exhibitions, schools have discretion to pursue alternative ways of providing this experience.<a id="information-for-candidates-registered-for-retakes-may-2020"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Information for candidates registered for retakes in the May 2020 examination session</h2>
<p><strong>I registered as a retake candidate–can I still retake in this May 2020 session?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, however, as the IB is only assessing coursework now that the May examinations have been cancelled you will need to submit new coursework to the IB to receive a new grade - the IB cannot base grades on a coursework result from a previous year. The subject teacher will be required to confirm that the work you have completed is new and as part of a sampling process, the IB may request a copy of your old work to validate this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I wanted to keep the IA I did last year and just improve my marks in the exam–why can I not do that?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic we are not setting examinations this year, so you will not have the chance to improve your exam results. As you already have a result in a previous session with the IA you did at the time, it would not be a retake if you were able to receive a new grade without submitting any new work to the IB.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What does “new coursework” mean?</strong></p>
<p>When new coursework is submitted, it is not sufficient for you to make minor changes to the work previously submitted. In principle, entirely different work should be submitted for assessment. However, the IB recognizes that for very substantial coursework tasks (for example: the design project for design technology) this may not be feasible given the time constraints. In such cases, substantial modification of the original work is acceptable. If modified work is submitted it will be marked as new.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When is the coursework due for retake candidates?</strong></p>
<p>For retake candidates the coursework is due no later than Monday 4 May. This takes into account the fact that students can no longer carry forward coursework from previous assessments and will be starting original work now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if I don’t have time to do a new IA?</strong></p>
<p>We recognise that you may not have the opportunity, time or access to resources to do a new IA; in this case you will need to defer to a future session, if the subject is available. However, we are providing this opportunity for those who are able to complete a new IA so that they can achieve a new grade this session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will the IB know if I have submitted coursework from a previous session?</strong></p>
<p>The IB will require information and verification from the school where you were registered in your last year of DP/CP</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I want to retake in Literature (Lit) or Language and Literature (LAL) do I have to redo both the oral and the written task?</strong></p>
<p>No. You need to submit at least one new component per subject, but for these subjects that can be either a new oral or a new written task.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I want to retake in Global Politics HL do I have to redo both the oral and the written task?</strong></p>
<p>No. You need to submit at least one new component per subject, but that can be either one of the tasks</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If retake candidates do not wish to defer will the IB allow them to redo their coursework for May 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens for a retake candidate who is resubmitting coursework for some subjects but carrying forward marks for others?</strong></p>
<p>For retake this session a student must submit new coursework for all retake subjects, or defer to a future session, if the subjects are available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What about retake candidates who already completed their retake EE or TOK essay assessments?</strong></p>
<p>EE and TOK are being marked and grades issued as normal in the DP May 2020 session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Must all retake candidates defer or only candidates who have brought forward coursework marks?</strong></p>
<p>Candidates must submit new coursework in the May 2020 session if they wish to obtain a grade. If you are not able to submit new coursework then you can defer to a future session, if the subject is available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do I need to defer if I am just re-doing TOK/EE?</strong></p>
<p>You do not need to defer if you are only retaking TOK/EE. TOK and EE are being marked and grades issued as normal in the May 2020 session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If last session I completed the coursework but didn’t submit it, can I use it for this session?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but please ensure that it was not submitted. The IB cannot accept a re-submission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I didn’t submit my TOK essay last time can I submit it this May session?</strong></p>
<p>No. Your TOK essay title must be selected from the list for the May 2020 session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I submit my resit coursework myself?</strong></p>
<p>Retake students will need to verify their submissions via the school that they attended for their studies of the Diploma Programme/Career-Related Programme. Retake candidates should contact their school to notify them that they will be retaking, if they haven’t already, and ask for them to assist with the verification process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I registered to retake my exams at a different school to the one I registered with for my DP/CP course studies, can they verify my coursework as being new?</strong></p>
<p>No. This school would not have a record of your previous coursework and you will need to go back to the school you were registered with previously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I have been working on preparing for my retakes over the past 6-12 months and I believe my predicted grades should have gone up. Can I change my predicted grades?</strong></p>
<p>No. The IB will only consider adjusted predicted grades when verified by your school as evidenced by on-going work assessed by the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I have been enrolled for the last year/6-months at a school and I have been taking classes. The school has registered me for the May 2020 session and has set predicted grades for me based on my work this year. Can the new predicted grades be used for this session along with the new coursework submitted?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The school will need to verify any changes in predicted grades based on your performance in school-based work over the last 6-12 months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am a coordinator and I have been contacted by a candidate who has already left the school and they need me to help with their retake, what do I need to do?</strong></p>
<p>You will need to verify that the candidate who was previously registered at your school has submitted new coursework.<a id="coursework-and-deadline-extensions"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Coursework and deadline extensions</h2>
<p><strong>What are the deadlines for upload of materials?</strong></p>
<p>In order to award a Diploma or certificate, we will be requiring all schools to upload <strong>all internal assessments (IAs) for every candidate</strong> enrolled in the May 2020 session except for the DP and CP core subjects, Language A subjects, Arts subjects and the Global Politics HL Extension Oral. For the DP and CP core subjects, Language A subjects, Arts subjects and the Global Politics HL Extension Oral, samples of IA will need to be submitted for moderation as usual. It is critical that schools start preparing to upload these as soon as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will be advising schools when the system is ready for additional uploads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Schools who have already completed their sample uploads:</strong> will now need to prepare all the internal assessments (IAs) for all diploma, course and CP candidates.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Schools who have not yet completed the uploads:</strong> will need to upload all the internal assessments (IAs) for all diploma, course and CP candidates.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>All schools should enter predicted grades.</strong></p>
<p>For concerns regarding any specific subject coursework completion and/or uploading please contact <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a></p>
<p>All student coursework and associated predicted grades will need to be uploaded by 20 April, if not sooner, in order to guarantee delivery of results by 5 July.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why have the IA extension dates for submission been removed?</strong></p>
<p>The previously approved extension dates have been retracted because these were issued prior to the cancellation of the May examinations. Now that we know the examinations are cancelled and grades will be awarded based on the coursework outcomes and predicted grades, we need schools to submit coursework by the original deadlines. With the students and schools no longer having to prepare for the IB exams, those schools who were struggling to balance the need to complete the IAs and prepare for exams will now be able to turn their attention to the IAs. As soon as the IB receives the uploaded work we will be able start our work on assessment and the delivery of final awards to meet the student needs for progression to university. The examination of every candidate's IAs is new for the IB and we can only guarantee delivery of results in July if we get the student work uploaded by the deadline. The IB still allows schools to apply for extensions as they would under normal conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Guidance for completing coursework for each subject group</h3>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We can't meet the deadlines to upload works, how can we apply for an extension?</strong></p>
<p>Please contact IB Answers on <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a> to request an extension. Please note that results cannot be guaranteed on the 5 July 2020 where extensions are given, which may result in a pending (P) grade on results release day.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the group 6 deadline the 20 April or 30 April?</strong></p>
<p>The original deadlines apply. For internally assessed (IA) work the deadline is 20 April. For externally assessed coursework the deadline is 30 April. For MYP information please navigate to the MYP section of the FAQ.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When will the eCoursework system be ready for students and schools to upload the additional file?</strong></p>
<p>Thursday 2 April 2020 GMT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can candidates upload Internal Assessment (IA) work that will now be externally assessed by the IB?</strong></p>
<p>By default, *, candidates will be given the option to upload their Internal Assessment work (that will now be externally assessed) to the school for submission to the IB. Once uploaded by the candidate, the submission will appear in the ‘Candidate submitted, pending school upload’ status, which is visible on the eCoursework dashboard. At this stage, the school must upload the ‘Criteria marks and teacher marking comments’ document, complete the authentication process and submit to the IB for assessment.</p>
<p>For further information regarding uploading work to the eCoursework system, please refer to the eCoursework user guide and eCoursework user guide for candidates available on the programme resource centre.</p>
<p>* There is functionality within the system for a school to restrict access to candidates and upload the work themselves (this is explained in the eCoursework user guide).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the eCoursework screens be re-opened if work has already been submitted?</strong></p>
<p>No, if work has already been submitted, then it is this work that the IB will mark. In addition, we are advising schools to upload all completed coursework as soon as they are able to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can work be resubmitted closer to the extended deadline?</strong></p>
<p>No, if work has already been submitted, then it is this work that the IB will mark. In addition, we are advising schools to upload all completed coursework as soon as they can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will all eCoursework be marked?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, all submitted materials will be assessed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Should we upload unfinished work?</strong></p>
<p>No, please ask for an extension if required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can schools bulk upload from Turnitin?</strong></p>
<p>No. The eCoursework system will be used and normal processes followed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do group 6 need to upload all external and by when?</strong></p>
<p>Group 6 assessment will continue as normal, apart from the Music exam being cancelled. Group 6 components which are usually internally assessed (IA) will only require a sample of candidates. The original deadlines apply. For internally assessed (IA) work the deadline is 20 April. For externally assessed coursework the deadline is 30 April.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do we need to enter, verify marks and enter criteria marks and comments for IA?</strong></p>
<p>For components which are not being externally marked you will still need to enter, verify marks and enter criteria marks and comments in IBIS. This applies to the IA for the core, Language A, the Arts subjects and Global Politics HL Extension Oral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the requirements for adding teacher annotations and criteria marks?</strong></p>
<p>We will need teacher annotations and criteria marks for each piece of work uploaded. We understand that this does involve significant additional work. If this is already contained in original works this is fine, if it is not you will need to upload a separate document containing these for each student and each piece of work. For schools who are unable to meet the advertised deadlines an extension can be provided but we would be unable to guarantee results by the 5th July.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do I need to upload a clean copy of works without teacher marking comments and criteria marks and then upload a separate document containing these?</strong></p>
<p>If uploaded works contain teacher marking comments and criteria marks this is fine there is no need to upload a clean copy. The system will require the upload of a separate document but if this detail (teacher marking comments and criteria marks) is included in the original works then you will just need to upload a file stating that these are included in the original work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why does assessment require the criterion marks and teacher annotations? What will this be used for?</strong></p>
<p>The IA tasks are designed for teacher assessment. Teachers know the level of support and guidance given to each candidate and other factors that are relevant when marking the work. The teacher marks and comments will be displayed to the examiner when they mark the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If we have already submitted our internal assessment coursework for M20, will we need to resubmit and include the criteria marks and teacher comments form?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no requirement to re-submit coursework that has already been submitted. Comments and marks are retained from when originally submitted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can schools access the criteria marks and teacher comments that were previously entered in IBIS?</strong></p>
<p>Schools no longer have access to these screens in IBIS. However, examiners will have access to this information for any coursework that was submitted before changes were made to the eCoursework upload screens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do we need to upload all IAs for TOK?</strong></p>
<p>No. Only a sample will be required for the TOK Presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are we required to upload all language orals, or still following the moderation process?</strong></p>
<p>The Language A (group 1) subjects will only require samples of the IA orals and will follow the moderation process. The Language B and Language ab initio subjects (group 2) will require all candidates’ orals to be uploaded for external marking.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can my N20 / M21 candidates complete their Group 1 LIT / LAL Individual Oral Assessments remotely following the guidance laid out for M20 candidates?</strong></p>
<p>Yes – this is acceptable. The preferred medium is Skype or a similar online platform.</p>
<p>For N20 candidates - teachers should follow the guidelines as outlined for M20 candidates, including remotely supervised preparation time.</p>
<p>For M21 candidates – candidates should submit their outline along with their chosen extract(s) / text(s) to the teacher one week prior to the recording of the assessment (as recommended in the Guide). The teacher should check that the candidate has no access to additional material other than their outline and their chosen extract(s) / text(s) prior to starting the assessment. This should include a request for candidates to show their rooms to check for visible / hidden material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h3>eCoursework upload technical questions</h3>
<p><strong>I'm seeing the 'You have no candidates registered for this session' on the IA mark entry screen for groups 2,3,4 &amp; 5.</strong></p>
<p>IA marks are not required to be entered in IBIS for group 2,3,4 and 5 (except for Global Politics HL extension oral), please continue to the eCoursework upload screen to upload the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When I click on eCoursework there is a message saying a new tab will open but nothing happens.</strong></p>
<p>You may have pop-up windows disabled. Please allow pop-up windows in your browser which will correct the issue or contact <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a> for further details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I have entered the criteria marks/comments for my students, but I didn't submit them. Now that the system has been updated [2nd April] I'm unable to see these comments/marks. Have they been saved? If so, do I still need to upload the teacher comments/criteria marks document?</strong></p>
<p>IA criteria marks and comments have been removed from IBIS for all students in groups 2,3,4 &amp; 5 (except for Global Politics HL extension oral).</p>
<p>If eCoursework was not submitted before the IBIS system update, schools will need to upload the teacher marks and comments document with all eCoursework.</p>
<p>For eCoursework that was submitted prior to the IBIS system update there is no need to upload anything extra.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Completing assessment components</h3>
<p><strong>How can teachers authenticate work that is being completed remotely?</strong></p>
<p>Academic integrity is a fundamental principle of an IB education and should be embedded throughout the learner journey and school ethos. Teachers should follow normal procedures to authenticate work to the best of their knowledge and reiterate the importance of academic integrity with their students. The IB expects teachers to use best endeavour, but also recognizes the difficulties faced as the result of remote working. The IB will undertake additional checks for plagiarism and collusion.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the school to ensure that IB rules and regulations are adhered to. <a href="/contentassets/76d2b6d4731f44ff800d0d06d371a892/academic-integrity-policy-english.pdf">For more information on the IB rules and regulations</a>.</p>
<p>Please review both:</p>
<ol>
<li>The school maladministration penalty matrix (page 28, section 1.2)<br><br>
</li>
<li>The student academic misconduct penalty matrix (page 32, section 2.2)</li>
</ol>
<p>Both matrices illustrate what the consequences are for instances where the rules and guidance are not followed and identified by the IB. The document also has a dedicated section for parents (page 17–18), which explains that undue assistance to their children is not acceptable.</p>
<p>The IB is aware of many tutoring companies across the world offering support to IB World Schools and IB candidates. Other individuals and parents can also offer face-to-face supporting services. Both cases are unacceptable as they provide students with undue assistance.</p>
<p>It is the school’s responsibility to follow IB rules and regulations. All IB documents are clear in what is and is not permitted in terms of support to IB candidates. IB World Schools are obliged to follow that guidance and authenticate only what is the true/genuine and unaided work of a candidate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can we use video conference or video calls for language oral assessments?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the evolving nature of the situation for schools, the IB has re-visited this scenario and has created a policy around conducting remote oral activities without the need for physical invigilation.</p>
<p>Maintaining academic integrity is paramount in the completion of IB assessment and examinations. Therefore, teachers conducting any of the assessments listed above, must ensure that they are conducted in full adherence to the guidelines described in the relevant subject guides and assessment procedures when trying to replicate the conditions followed when completing such tasks in the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For language orals</strong>, please ensure that the principles and procedures below are adhered to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy of any abstract or stimulus sent to the candidates must be clean copies</li>
<li>Copy of any abstract/stimulus sent to the candidates must not be previously known or discussed with the candidate</li>
<li>Preparation time must be supervised (remotely)</li>
<li>Notes taken during the supervised preparation time must be short</li>
<li>Notes taken during the supervised preparation time must only be consulted and not read during the recording time</li>
<li>The room should be free of any written material on the walls or ceilings, regardless of whether these appear related to the subject being examined (some judgement may be required regarding visual material) **</li>
<li>Only one blank piece of paper must be available on the candidate’s desk for note taking**</li>
</ul>
<p>** <em>students can be asked to show their rooms with their mobile phone cameras (walls and areas underneath their desks) to confirm that no unauthorized materials are visible/hidden.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Internet outages or technical issues during remote oral assessments</h3>
<p>For oral assessments being conducted over Skype (or similar), it is recommended that an external recording device is used.<br>If technical or internet difficulties occur, the recording can be paused and restarted when the issue is resolved. If a recording is paused, the teacher should explain the reason (on the recording) after restarting.<br>Should internet outages or technical issues mean that the oral assessment cannot continue, it must be rescheduled to a later date. In this case, please ensure that a new assessment is given to the candidate(s) concerned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the deadline for the self-taught oral uploads, is it still 7 May?</strong></p>
<p>The original deadlines apply. The school supported self-taught orals must be uploaded no later than 7 May</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can we use virtual presentations for DP theory of knowledge (TOK), extended essay (EE) and global politics HL internal assessments if our school is closed?</strong></p>
<p>To enable DP/CP students impacted by school closure because of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) to complete their assignment with their teacher, the IB supports the remote completion of the reflective project, theory of knowledge, viva voce completion of the extended essay and global politics HL extension presentations, to be completed as virtual presentations using video conferencing applications, such as Skype, Zoom or similar methods.</p>
<p>Ideally, the teacher should set up a virtual situation that resembles the face-to-face presentation as closely as possible. The IB recognizes that presenting via video conference is a different skill to presenting in person and that the candidates may find it to be a more difficult experience. However, because of the nature of the presentation, where the quality of the student’s thinking is being assessed and not their presentation skills, this is a viable alternative in these exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>When marking the presentations, the teacher is reminded that it is the subject matter that is being assessed and not to make any adjustments for poor quality connections or problems with the sound. Schools are also able to request an extension to submission dates, should this be required. A reminder that for the RP and EE, while the viva voce/final reflection may take place virtually, the student’s written summary of the meeting must still be included on their uploaded RPPF for assessment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can we use video chat or voice calls for language orals when a candidate’s school is closed, and the candidate is in a different country with an available IB World School?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The candidate can take the oral / complete the extended essay viva voce at another local IB World School, if the host school provides a teacher to conduct the assessment and the recording is sent to the candidate’s registered school for marking.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The candidate can take the oral / conduct the TOK presentation / complete the extended essay viva voce at another local IB World School over video chat / voice call with their usual teacher conducting the assessment but a teacher from the host school must be present as an invigilator for the candidate. In this way, a candidate can do their assessment remotely with their usual teacher but without compromising examination integrity.</li>
</ol>
<p>In neither scenario do we require any paperwork, such as an alternative venue form, to be completed nor additional notes required to be added in teacher comments. This arrangement does not need approval from the IB and can be managed by the school with no need to notify us.</p>
<p>Sourcing a host school to support this arrangement is the responsibility of the candidate’s registered school. We recommend using the <a href="/programmes/find-an-ib-school/">Find an IB World School search on the public website to support your research</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Completing coursework for Group 6</h3>
<p>For further details about the requirements for DPCP ARTS (Group 6) components, please read our <a href="/globalassets/news-assets/coronavirus/guidance-dpcp-arts-en.pdf">DP CP Arts guidance</a> <a href="/globalassets/news-assets/coronavirus/coronavirus-outbreak-faq-en.pdf"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/globalassets/file-type-icons/ib_icon_pdf.svg" alt="pdf" height="20"></a> [0.2 MB]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do I do if my candidate can complete some, but not all components for a Group 6 course?</strong></p>
<p>All completed components should be uploaded to the IB. The DP/CP coordinator should contact <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a> with details of the candidate session number, subject, level and the component that cannot be completed. The candidate will be considered under our regular process for missing components.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Should we submit Group 6 work which is incomplete?</strong></p>
<p>Schools should only submit Group 6 work which is complete and can be assessed against all published assessment criteria. Some allowances have been made in certain components to help schools ensure that work can be completed; for example, a Visual Arts Exhibition at home, a Theatre Research Presentation conducted remotely, engaging with an online audience instead of a live audience, using a recorded accompaniment for Music Solo performance instead of a live accompaniment. These are detailed in the Group 6 document: DP CP Arts Guidance. Schools and teachers are best placed to advise candidates if the work they are able to complete fulfils the assessment criteria and demonstrates their performance accordingly and appropriately. Where a component cannot be completed in full due to circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DP/CP coordinator should contact IB Answers with details of the candidate session number, subject, level and the component that cannot be completed. The candidate will be considered under our process for missing components. If an extension to the deadline would help a candidate to complete a component, please contact IB Answers to request an extension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Dance Performance and Dance Composition and Analysis, submissions of staged performance in costume under theatrical lighting and/or studio recordings with unmasked mirrors are not permissible according to the Dance Guide. What if this is the only footage we have available to submit?</strong></p>
<p>For the May 20 session schools are able to submit such footage for assessment for both Dance Composition and Analysis and for Dance Performance. However, in Dance Performance the candidate must be clearly identifiable throughout the piece. If the candidate’s Dance Performance work is selected for the moderation sample, please write a comment about the need to submit such footage in the teacher comments section in IBIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Dance Composition and Analysis, what should a student do if their composition is under the required time and they are not able to complete the full time due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>The student and teacher are best placed to consider whether the composition is sufficient to meet the task requirements for a full submission. If both student and teacher are confident that there is sufficient work to be assessed against the criteria, then the work should be submitted. It is advised that the student should discuss the decision in the analytical statement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Dance Performance, can candidates film their duet at home as if their partner was dancing with them?</strong></p>
<p>The student and teacher are best placed as to consider whether this work can be completed with due regard for health and safety. If the teacher is satisfied that the work meets the task requirements for a full submission, then the piece can be assessed by the teacher. If the work is selected for the moderation sample, please write a comment explaining the decisions taken in the teacher comments section in IBIS. It is also recommended that the student makes a statement in their programme notes on their interpretation and explains any decisions of this nature they have taken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can CAS requirements be met?</strong></p>
<p>The CAS program does not count hours, only the achievement of learning outcomes. Due to the virus, we would understand that schools' and students may not be in session for a time and thus, may not be able to continue with CAS. In this situation, the safety of our students comes first and hopefully they have many of their learning outcomes already completed. We will be continuing to review deadlines in relation to this.</p>
<p>The final deadline for notifying the IB of individual candidates completing CAS for a May session is 1 June 2020. For candidates to be awarded the diploma, this information will need to be processed prior to the issue of results. We can therefore extend the deadline up to 3 July 2020 for candidates that may require additional time. Candidates who are unable to complete the CAS requirements by 3 July 2020 are allowed one further year in which to complete it. This further year expires on 1 June 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Adverse Circumstances</h3>
<p><strong>What is included under adverse circumstances for this session?</strong></p>
<p>The usual definition of adverse applies except that in relation to the pandemic, only individual circumstances which are over and beyond the experience of other students will be included. It is also now centred on submission of coursework not the written exams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is the shutdown of a school or the uncertainty and stress that has affected all students not included under adverse circumstances?</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic is an adverse circumstance that has affected all schools worldwide. We will take it into account through our grade award processes. Support will still be offered to schools in situations where they face challenges, in terms of extensions and deferrals but they will not go through the adverse circumstances route. In this case schools must contact <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What actions will the IB take to address individual candidates affected by adverse circumstances?</strong></p>
<p>Most candidates will be supported through extensions. Deferral of assessment to a future examination session may be the best course of action for some students, such as, where the candidate has completed very little or no coursework. There will be no charge for this deferral.</p>
<p>Special consideration will only be considered for very severe and challenging circumstances as a last resort if the candidate cannot be supported through extensions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the deadline for submitting the ‘Candidate(s) affected by adverse circumstances’ form?</strong></p>
<p>The form must be received by the IB within 10 calendar days post the published coursework deadline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What supporting documentation should be submitted with the ‘Candidate(s) affected by adverse circumstances’ form?</strong></p>
<p>Where available, medical or psychological evidence must be submitted along with the request. Where there are no reports from professionals available due to the situation of the pandemic, the IB will work with schools to consider other alternative forms of evidence.<a id="middle-years-programme-eassessment"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Middle Years Programme (MYP) eAssessment</h2>
<p><strong>Are MYP eAssessments also going to be postponed or cancelled?</strong></p>
<p>The IB will be taking the following actions for the 2020 May MYP eAssessment session:</p>
<ul>
<li>May 2020 MYP on-screen examinations are cancelled.<br><br>
</li>
<li>e-Portfolio and Personal Projects grades will be issued.<br><br>
</li>
<li>MYP certificate will be awarded, reflecting achievements from a combination of Personal Project, ePortfolio subjects, and predicted grades for other subjects.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When will MYP results be issued?</strong></p>
<p>The IB plans to release results to schools as intended on 1 August 2020. The samples of ePortfolio, personal project and predicted grades for on-screen subjects will need to be uploaded by 20 May, if not sooner, in order to deliver results by 1 August.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will we be able to submit an Enquiry Upon Results (EUR) for ePortfolio and personal project?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, schools will be able to submit category 3 EURs for ePortfolio subjects and personal project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In cases where schools will be open, and students would want to take MYP on-screen examinations, will the IB send on-screen examinations?</strong></p>
<p>No. We have consulted widely and many schools and school systems around the world have been closed or are closing to contain the pandemic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can MYP coursework be resubmitted?</strong></p>
<p>No, if coursework has already been submitted, then it is this work that the IB will moderate. In addition, we are advising schools to upload all samples of coursework as soon as they can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the deadlines for MYP?</strong></p>
<p>The coursework submission for ePortfolio and Personal Project has been extended to 20 May. Teacher Assessed Totals for ePortfolio subjects and personal project, plus predicted grades for on-screen subjects, need to be entered before 20 May, in time to allow IBIS to generate the student coursework samples to be submitted to the IB via the eCoursework portal. MYP coordinators should leave sufficient time for these administrative steps to take place prior to 20 May.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My school is closed and the local authorities do not allow teachers to ask students for work during this time. Under these circumstances, I will not have access to any of my students’ work.</strong></p>
<p>The IB will not be able to award grades for any candidates if the school does not submit the required samples for moderation. For concerns regarding any specific subject coursework completion and/or uploading please contact <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a>. Alternatively, schools can either withdraw the candidates from the May 2020 session or defer the candidates to the November session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if some students cannot complete ePortfolio and personal project due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>Guidance on how to complete the ePortfolio remotely has been issued. The personal project can be completed remotely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Adapted partially completed unit planners have been published, how should I use them?</strong></p>
<p>Some changes have been brought to some of the partially completed unit planners to enable students to complete the work remotely.</p>

</li>
<li>Schools that cannot complete and mark the work against the original partially completed unit planners (PCUPs) need to follow the guidance in the updated PCUPs. Please notify <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a> if that is the case.<br><br>
</li>
<li>For the criteria that cannot be assessed, you will need to award “8”. These are criterion B for Arts and criterion D for Design.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The IB will make necessary adjustments to ensure a fair outcome for all candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if my school has already completed and uploaded ePortfolio for the non-adapted Partially Completed Unit Planner for Arts, Design or PHE?</strong></p>
<p>Schools that are able to fully complete and mark their students’ ePortfolios should upload them as per any other examination session. ePortfolios that have already been completed and uploaded do not need to be redone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if my school has not yet uploaded ePortfolio for the non-adapted Partially Completed Unit Planner for Arts, Design or PHE?</strong></p>
<p>Schools that are able to fully complete and mark their students’ ePortfolios should upload them as per any other examination session. ePortfolios that have already been completed do not need to be redone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What subjects will be available in the MYP November session?</strong></p>
<p>The digital nature of MYP on-screen assessments makes it possible for the November 2020 examination session to be expanded to offer the same subject availability as May 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I want to improve my overall result in the MYP certificate, can I take onscreen examinations in November?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The digital nature of MYP on-screen assessments makes it possible for the November 2020 examination session to be expanded to offer the same subject availability as May 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MYP ePortfolio guidance</h3>
<p><strong>Will the ePortfolio subjects be moderated as usual?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The ePortfolios will be sampled and moderated as per the normal assessment process</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The IB has reviewed each of the MYP ePortfolio subjects according to the associated risk to the candidate in being able to complete the eAssessments and meet the demands of the assessment criteria.</strong></p>
<p>Personal project: can be completed remotely from the school setting. The IB is extending the submission deadline to 20 May 2020.</p>
<p>PHE; Design; Dance; Drama; Media; Music; Visual Art: These subjects require either collaboration with other students and/or access to specialist equipment. Subjects with a performance element can be completed remotely with adjustments. For these subjects the IB is extending the submission deadline to 20 May 2020.</p>
<p>Please see the adapted PCUPs for Arts, Design and PHE for guidance on how to assess ePortfolios that have to be completed remotely with adjustments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can the MYP Language Acquisition ePortfolio tasks be conducted?</strong></p>
<p>The IB understands the challenges caused by remote completion of the MYP Language Acquisition tasks for the M20 ePortoflio. Therefore, schools are permitted to set their candidates tasks remotely and under timed assessment conditions as outlined on page 103 of the guide, if these activities are invigilated by a responsible adult. Each ePortfolio needs to contain the completed and signed <a href="/globalassets/news-assets/coronavirus/responsible-adult-invigilation-form-en.pdf">Responsible Adult Invigilation Form</a> as a coversheet when uploaded to the eCoursework portal. For guidance on completion of the interactive oral task please see the guidelines provided for the DP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can teachers authenticate work that is completed remotely?</strong></p>
<p>Academic integrity is a fundamental principle of an IB education and should be embedded throughout the learner journey and school ethos. Teachers should follow normal procedures to authenticate work to the best of their knowledge and reiterate the importance of academic integrity with their students. The IB expects teachers to use best endeavour, but also recognizes the difficulties faced as the result of remote working. The IB will undertake additional checks for plagiarism and collusion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the deadline for MYP Personal Project and ePortfolio?</strong></p>
<p>The deadline for MYP Personal Project and ePortfolio is 20 May.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MYP candidates are unable to meet their supervisors to sign off their Academic Honesty forms for the personal project. Can this be completed digitally?</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Academic Honesty form is to record a candidate’s progress and the nature of their discussions with their supervisor, with at least three supervision sessions taking place. These should be spread out across the beginning, middle and end of the project. We would anticipate two of the three supervisions to have already taken place according to the usual process before school closures impacted on the final session. Provided this process has been followed, we are able to accept a virtual meeting for the final supervision, to be signed off digitally (securely verified signature) or electronically (scanned/typed signature) by the candidate/their supervisor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can you confirm the ‘Service as Action’ component will be awarded based on the part of the year completed (i.e. up to March)?</strong></p>
<p>The “Service as Action” requirement does not count hours, only the achievement of learning outcomes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we would understand that schools' and students may not be in session for a time and thus, may not be able to continue with Service as Action. In this situation, the safety of our students comes first and hopefully they have many of their learning outcomes already completed. The final deadline for notifying the IB of individual candidates completing Service as Action for a May session is 1 June 2020. For candidates to be awarded the certificate, this information will need to be processed prior to the issue of results on 1 August. We can therefore extend the deadline up to 31 July 2020 for candidates that may require additional time. Candidates who are unable to complete the Service as Action requirements by 31 July 2020 are allowed one further year in which to complete it. This further year expires on 1 June 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What about the MYP November session, is this impacted in any way?</strong></p>
<p>At this time, we plan that the November 2020 exam session will proceed as scheduled.<a id="teaching-and-learning"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p><strong>How can we continue teaching when our school is closed?</strong></p>
<p>We have developed a guidance for schools that are facing closures and quarantines due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak. It contains suggestions and guidelines for online and blended learning, with further suggestions for free apps and solutions for schools that may not have online or mobile solutions in place at the time of closing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How should online teaching and learning be managed?</strong></p>
<p>During this difficult time, schools can use available means to try and make alternative arrangements for study so that students are not disadvantaged by any closures including online or remote teaching. We have produced a resource to support schools using online and blended learning. Read more about <a href="/globalassets/news-assets/coronavirus/online-learning-continuity-planning-en.pdf">online learning planning for schools</a>.</p>
<p>Any student who has not received enough teaching has the option to defer to a subsequent session for some or all the assessments, free of charge. For advice on supporting teaching and learning, please contact your IB World School Manager directly or <a href="mailto:support@ibo.org">support@ibo.org</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We were due to host an event/award ceremony should this go ahead?</strong></p>
<p>Schools should follow local guidelines and travel restrictions when making decisions about school events.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Primary Years Programme (PYP)</h2>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate screen time for early learners and for primary years learners?</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the IB Online learning, teaching and education continuity planning for schools for guidance on managing screen time and recommended screen time for different ages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do students have to complete the exhibition project if the schools are closed?</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many schools are using this opportunity to explore supporting students with their exhibition digitally. Schools might consider ways to celebrate the process with students, such as virtual celebrations or accolades on end of the year report. However, for students completing their final year in the PYP in May, June or July 2020, there is no requirement for schools and students to complete the exhibition process if they are under adverse circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do schools have to complete all six units of the programme of inquiry?</strong></p>
<p>For many schools, teachers can modify their planned units to accommodate the completion of their programme of inquiry. However, for the current school year, there is no requirement for schools unable to complete all six units of inquiry to do so if they are under adverse circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Middle Years Programme (MYP)</h2>
<p><strong>Can MYP Year 4 students start the personal project now?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if schools feel that this is the right opportunity for students to begin their personal projects and can provide support to students remotely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are schools still required to assess all strands of all criteria at least twice?</strong></p>
<p>Although this is a programme requirement, we understand that it may not be possible this year given the extenuating circumstances. Schools have the flexibility to determine with their MYP teachers how to make professional judgements regarding their students’ achievement and how students can best demonstrate their learning if the planned summative assessments are not possible to be completed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How should schools report student achievement if some criteria have not been assessed twice?</strong></p>
<p>Schools can report the levels achieved in each criterion. While schools are required to communicate student achievement in each subject group to parents, there is no MYP requirement to report 1-7 grades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are schools still required to complete the community project?</strong></p>
<p>Schools are encouraged to modify the expectations of the community project so that its completion can occur where possible. Schools might consider ways they might celebrate the process with students, such as virtual celebrations or accolades on end of the year reports. However, schools are not expected to implement the project if the current circumstances do not support doing so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are schools allowed to modify the expectations of the community project so that their students can complete it remotely (and/or individually)?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. For the current academic year, schools can modify the community project to enable students to complete it.<a id="recognition"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Recognition and universities</h2>
<p><strong>Will universities accept the results?</strong></p>
<p>IB will provide university partners with clear information about the assessments that have been conducted during the student's participation in the two years of the DP and CP, and the process by which final marks were determined in this unusual year. We will continue to ensure the validity and the reliability of our assessment protocols.</p>
<p>Each university will be able to make informed decisions as they have done in the past about their IB policies regarding admissions, credit granting, advanced standing, and scholarship awards. Students should consult directly with universities to learn about their policies.. Universities will be best prepared to support any IB specific queries you might have after that time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the process of obtaining a transcript change?</strong></p>
<p>The IB is committed to maintaining its current processes in place as much as possible in an unprecedented global situation. The IB will be providing transcripts for IB Diploma, CP certificates and IB course certificates. Governments and universities will receive the information they need to make appropriate decisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the national or US State government in my area accept this ‘version’ of the IB?</strong></p>
<p>IB will provide governments with clear information about the assessments that have been conducted during the students’ participation in the two years of the DP and CP, and the process by which final marks were determined in this unusual year. We will continue to ensure the validity and the reliability of our assessment protocols.</p>
<p>Each entity will then be able to make informed decisions about the use of IB data for accountability and policy development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How is the IB communicating to universities?</strong></p>
<p>The IB is in regular communication with universities across the world. We have sent a communication bulletin to over 9,000 contacts globally encouraging admissions staff to review our 'For Universities' FAQs. We have issued a questionnaire to universities and ask them to update us on their approach with regards to May 2020 IB students. We aim to present a summary of those results here in April.<a id="information-for-universities"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Information for universities</h2>
<p>If you are a university or college, you can now <a href="https://mailbuild.ibo.org/h/r/F999D30E299D3DD9">sign up for regular updates</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can I inform the IB of our policy regarding admissions during the current COVID-19 impacted admissions cycle?</strong></p>
<p>The IB has developed a <a href="https://ibo.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3lY5Uo8ypWtvfMN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short questionnaire</a> which universities can update us with their policy decisions, so that we may keep our IB schools informed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will students be awarded a Diploma, numerical grade for each subject, the core and overall?</strong></p>
<p>We will be awarding Diplomas and Certificates for the May 2020 session:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a subject level, students will be awarded a grade on the normal IB 1-7 scale<br><br>
</li>
<li>Theory of Knowledge (TOK), the Extended Essay and the Career-Related Programme Reflective Project will be awarded a grade on the normal IB A-E scale<br><br>
</li>
<li>The DP core will be awarded on the normal IB 0-3 scale<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A total points score will be awarded for the Diploma, out of 45 as normal</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>On what basis will students be awarded their Diploma or Certificates?</strong></p>
<p>We will award each student a grade for each of their registered subjects using a calculation that takes into account their coursework marks and their predicted grade, as submitted to the IB by their school. For most components we will externally mark work that is usually marked by teachers, instead of taking samples and applying moderation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will you ensure that the student’s work is of appropriate quality to receive the grade?</strong></p>
<p>Coursework, for subjects where students would have been required to sit an exam, will now be externally marked by examiners. We will use our robust quality assurance methods to ensure coursework marks are reliable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the proportion of students receiving each grade and overall score be similar to previous years?</strong></p>
<p>We will aim to maintain the standard from previous years so that there is comparability with previous and future years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the transcript that universities and colleges receive look the same as previous years?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We will send transcripts to universities in the same way as previous years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When will the results be released to universities?</strong></p>
<p>We intend to release results on 5 July 2020, as previously advertised. If this changes, we will inform universities and colleges.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will students be able to appeal their results?</strong></p>
<p>Schools will be able to access the Enquiry Upon Results and Appeals services.<a id="authorization-and-evaluation"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Authorization and evaluation</h2>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the cancellation of face-to-face PD events impact my Authorization timeline?</strong></p>
<p>No. The IB has put measures in place to ensure that no schools are disadvantaged due to the cancellation of face to face PD events. Firstly, we are increasing the number of online PD offerings in order to support schools during this time. In considering the concerns and challenges created by COVID-19 for schools and knowing that you highly value the face to face professional development experience; if you would prefer to wait until face to face professional development is once again available the IB will accept any registration for PD within the next 12 months as evidence of meeting the professional development requirements as part of the authorization process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens if I have an upcoming verification visit?</strong></p>
<p>Following the recommendations and decisions by the various governing bodies, the IB has been assessing the need to use remote visit protocols in order to ensure that schools are not disadvantaged by this situation. Due to the increasing travel restrictions and wanting to ensure the safety of our IB community, the IB has made the decision that all verification visits currently scheduled between 12 March and 31 May 2020 will be conducted using remote visit protocols. These protocols have been emailed to impacted schools. If you have not received them, please contact your Programme Relationship Manager.</p>
<p>Please know that we have worked with our IB educators to ensure they are prepared to conduct the visit remotely. As part of this process, if the school is authorized, the IB World School Department will organize a face-to-face follow up visit within the first 12 months of authorized teaching. This is part of the process for any school in which a remote verification visit takes place. In direct communications with impacted schools we are asking you to confirm your virtual visits within 7 days of receiving the communication. If we do not hear from you within 7 days, we will need to postpone your scheduled visit.</p>
<p>Although we are supporting virtual visits during this time, we know that you highly value face to face visits, as such if you would prefer to postpone your verification visit until such time that it can occur in person that IB will support this request. In the communication sent directly to impacted schools you will have the option of confirming the virtual visit or sharing three potential visit dates between June and October via an online form. The IB aims to confirm your verification visit dates as soon as possible, and no later than one month in advance of the visit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens if I have an upcoming consultancy visit?</strong></p>
<p>Following the recommendations and decisions by the various governing bodies, the IB has been assessing the need to use remote visit protocols in order to ensure that schools are not disadvantaged by this situation. Due to the increasing travel restrictions and wanting to ensure the safety of our IB community, the IB has made the decision that all consultancy visits currently scheduled between 12 March 12 and 31 May 2020 will be conducted using remote visit protocols. These protocols have been emailed to impacted schools. If you have not received them, please contact your Programme Relationship Manager.</p>
<p>Please know that we have worked with our IB educators to ensure they are prepared to conduct the visit remotely. In direct communications with impacted schools we are asking you to confirm your virtual visits within 7 days of receiving the communication. If we do not hear from you within 7 days, we will need to postpone your scheduled visit.</p>
<p>Although we are supporting virtual visits during this time, we know that you highly value face to face visits, as such if you would prefer to postpone your consultancy visit until such time that it can occur in person we kindly request you communicate directly with your consultant and confirm a visit date between June and October. Once this date has been confirmed, please ask your consultant to communicate it to the IB directly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Virtual Visits – Authorization Process</h3>
<p><strong>Will there be support for schools and educators by undertaking virtual visits due to COVID-19 (coronavirus)</strong></p>
<p>Due to the increasing travel restrictions and wanting to ensure the safety of our IB community, the IB has made the decision that all verification visits and consultancy visits currently scheduled between 12 March 12 and 31 May 2020 will be conducted using remote visit protocols. In order to best support our schools, we need to be as flexible as possible in our approach. The guide itself is set up for the school being in session, however, as we know there are many variations; school staff are at the school but there are no students, the leadership team is at the school, but no teachers or students are on campus, all parties working and learning from home etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What must be in place for the visit to continue?</strong></p>
<p>During these extraordinary times the assigned IB educators will not travel to the Global Centre to conduct the visit, instead they will conduct the visit from their home location. As part of the visit process assigned educators must be able to schedule meetings with all relevant stakeholders, leadership, teachers, students, and parents. If these meetings can be scheduled using virtual communication tools the visit can continue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will the meetings take place?</strong></p>
<p>The remote visits for should be carried out over the regular time frame, staying as close as possible to the agenda for a face-to-face visit. For each scheduled meeting the agenda will provide a link to a virtual meeting room via Skype, WebEx, etc. which all participants and team members can click on to enter.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the team leader to ensure all meetings are set up with the appropriate meeting room link and that the virtual communication tool being used is accessible by the school. The team leader should confirm the schools preferred method of virtual communication tool prior to setting the agenda. If the team leader and school are not able to confirm a virtual communication tool that suits both parties, the team leader should contact the Programme Relationship Manager for ongoing support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can evidence of facilities (including exam storage) be provided?</strong></p>
<p>We understand that during this time of disruption that schools may not be able to provide visual evidence of facilities. If this is the situation the school finds itself in, visual evidence for practices that could not be obtained during the visit time will be requested through the MTBA process for verification visits. The school will provide descriptions of facilities during the virtual visit and these will be documented by the visiting team/consultant as part of the findings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can evidence of teaching and learning be provided (PYP and MYP)?</strong></p>
<p>Schools have been very resilient in during this time, implementing online learning initiatives to ensure that teaching and learning can continue. We encourage schools to use the online learning environments as demonstration of their commitment to inquiry-based pedagogy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens if a school experiences a closure at the very last moment?</strong></p>
<p>During this uncertain time, it is important that we all remain in communication with one another. There is the potential that a school may close in the lead up to, the morning of, or even midway through a visit. If this is the case, we ask that the school contacts their Programme Relationship Manager and the visiting team/consultant as a matter of priority. The IB will then reschedule the visit in conjunction with the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who should I contact?</strong></p>
<p>Schools: Please contact your Programme Relationship Manager<br>Educators:</p>
<ol>
<li>For logistics questions please contact School Delivery<br><br>
</li>
<li>For collecting evidence against the Standards and Practices questions please contact the school’s Programme Relationship Manager<br><br>
</li>
<li>For role-based questions, including the setting up of virtual meetings, please contact your Programme Relationship Manager.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p><strong>My evaluation visit has been postponed; how will I arrange the new date?</strong></p>
<p>School delivery will be in touch with you after May 2020 to arrange the next date for your evaluation visit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My evaluation has been postponed; will I need to re-upload the documents or provide an update on any of the documents for the visit?</strong></p>
<p>No, you will not unless you agree with your IB World School manager to upload more documents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We had a matter to be addressed for B2.3a, which is a professional development requirement. The workshop for the teachers to attend and address this matter has been cancelled. Will we receive an extension to the deadline to meet this matter?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Please contact your IB World School manger to agree on a plan forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to arrange a virtual evaluation visit if the visiting team is unable to travel to my school?</strong></p>
<p>In restricted travel and event situations, such as we are currently experiencing, it may be possible to have your evaluation visit conducted remotely (virtually). Please contact your IB World School manager in the first instance to discuss this option.<a id="travel-and-events"></a></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Conferences</h3>
<p><strong>What is the status of the IB Global Conference Toronto?</strong></p>
<p>The IB continues to monitor the evolving situation globally and provide support to our community in these difficult times. Since conference is more than two months away, the Global Conference in Toronto is still scheduled to take place 23-26 July. We hope that conditions improve enough by then to allow the Toronto conference to go on as planned, safely and confidently.</p>
<p>Therefore, we plan to move forward with the conference planning, while providing you with some clarity about our plan for deciding about cancelling the conference.</p>
<p>The IB will make that decision no later than 31 May 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Should I register and make plans for the IB Global Conference Toronto?</strong></p>
<p>In light of current circumstances, we understand that many may be reluctant to commit to the conference, and that your school or school authorities may have placed a temporary ban on travel. We still encourage you to register before 31 March 2020 to take advantage of the discount for early registrants. You might also consider making your hotel arrangements, which can be cancelled without any financial penalty in the event the conference is cancelled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If the IB Global Conference Toronto is cancelled, will I receive a full refund of my registration fee?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. If the conference is cancelled, the IB will provide a full refund of your registration fee. Alternatively, you can opt to receive a credit for a future conference, at your discretion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I attend another IB global conference?</strong></p>
<p>There are conferences later in the year in Toronto and the Hague. <a href="/conferences/">Find out more about IB conferences</a>.</p>
