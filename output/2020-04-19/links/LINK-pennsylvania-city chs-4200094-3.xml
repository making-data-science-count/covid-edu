<div>Hello Everyone:</div>
<div></div>
<div>We were just alerted that Governor Wolf just issued a declaration closing all Pennsylvania schools for 10 days starting March 16, 2020 (<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/13/Gov-Wolf-closes-all-K-12-schools-in-Pa-for-two-weeks/stories/202003130150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/13/Gov-Wolf-closes-all-K-12-schools-in-Pa-for-two-weeks/stories/202003130150</a>).  Parents will be contacted with new information as it unfolds  through City High’s emergency school closing systems and emails, as well as the school website in the coming weeks.</div>

<div>Do your best to stay healthy and care for your loved ones.</div>
