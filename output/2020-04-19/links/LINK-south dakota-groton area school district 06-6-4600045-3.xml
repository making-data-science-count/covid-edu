  <p><strong>Coronoavirus/COVID19 Information</strong></p>
<p>This page has been constructed for the purpose providing a single source of information being provided by the Groton Area School District throughout the current pandemic situation.  We've provided updates and announcements through a variety of platforms, but felt as though a single site may be helpful as the amount of information and frequency of announcements grows.</p>
<p>This situation is very unique and information is coming and changing very quickly based on all sorts of factors.  We will do our best to continue making decisions for the best interest of our students, staff, and community in the days and weeks ahead based upon the best information available to us.</p>

<p><a href="https://5il.co/exgn" target="_blank">Community Update April 9, 2020</a></p>
<p>Dear Families of Groton Area School Students,</p>
<p>As announced by Governor Noem earlier this week, South Dakota schools – including Groton Area – will remain closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.  We will continue to promote educational growth and opportunity through implementation of the flexible learning plan.  More than ever, we’re counting on the cooperation of parents and students in actively participating in this learning by completing assignments and participating in class activities.  While nothing can replace the time we’re losing in school, we all share a responsibility to grow as much as possible during this time.</p>
<p>For the week of April 13 through April 17, there will be a couple of changes to what has become our new “normal” routine.  First, the delivery of academic materials will take place on Tuesday, April 14<sup>th</sup> in the typical manner at the MS/HS and elementary buildings according to the schedule below for in-town students and by using our bus routes for out-of-town students.  <u>School lunches will be handed out in a drive-thru manner from the elementary location only</u> – MS/HS students receiving lunches should pick up their school work then drive through the elementary parking lot to pick up their lunches.  If your family is not currently receiving lunches but would like to begin, please contact Mr. Clocksene at <a href="mailto:Brandon.Clocksene@k12.sd.us">Brandon.Clocksene@k12.sd.us</a>.  The second date for meal delivery next week will be Thursday, April 16 by delivery and at the elementary.</p>
<p>During this process, we want to ensure that we can be mindful of the recommendations of health officials concerning the size of group gatherings, personal hygiene for clean hands, and social distancing.  Only one representative from each family will be permitted to pick up materials and will be asked to take materials for all family members.  <strong>Nobody that feels ill or is otherwise under advisement for quarantine should be sent to gather materials.</strong>  We must also request for questions and discussions with staff members be limited during the in-person exchanges and invite those questions via phone call or email.  It is possible that not all students will have materials to pick up if all of their content is being provided online.  <u>We are encouraging people to wear bandanas or facemasks when they pick materials up.  School staff have been asked to wear masks as an additional level of protection for those we encounter, so don’t be alarmed by this when you arrive.</u></p>
<p>The following schedule of material pick-up has been established for in-town residents.  If possible, we ask that you make every effort to follow the timelines provided.  If families are unable to make the established times work, they will not be turned away, but access may be managed if certain times become too busy.  Each building will be open for pick-up from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM.  Pick-up from the elementary will be held in the Elementary Commons.  Pick-up from the MS/HS will be held in the GHS Gymnasium. </p>

<p>Dear Families of Groton Area School Students,</p>
<p>Time marches on and learning will continue.  Our plan for the next several weeks will continue to operate much as it has since inception.  Details are included below on how distribution of lunches and school materials will take place over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Delivery of the next week’s academic materials will take place on Monday, April 6, 2020.  Following our Easter break, academic materials will be distributed on Tuesday, April 14, 2020.  During this process, we want to ensure that we can be mindful of the recommendations of health officials concerning the size of group gatherings, personal hygiene for clean hands, and social distancing.  Only one representative from each family will be permitted to pick up materials and will be asked to take materials for all family members.  <strong>Nobody that feels ill in any way should be sent to gather materials.</strong>  We must also request for questions and discussions with staff members be limited during the in-person exchanges and invite those questions via phone call or email.

<p>Dear Families of Groton Area School Students,</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for their cooperation in receipt of materials on Wednesday, March 25.

This includes all extra-curricular events, practices, and meetings.</p>

<p>The District will continue to offer free lunches to all enrolled students regardless of income eligibility.  Meals will be provided to families on Mondays in conjunction with distribution of academic materials.  For those families with multiple students, the meals will be distributed from the building of the youngest student.  For example, a family with students in grades 3, 4, and 8 will pick up their meals from the elementary.  A family with students in grades 7 and 10 would pick up their meals from the high school.

<p>Groton Area School Community,</p>
<p>You should have received a personal contact yesterday from your child’s teacher about the current state of affairs for the Groton Area School District.</p>
<p>Beginning tomorrow morning (Wednesday, March 25) at 7:00 AM, the Groton Area Elementary Commons and Groton Area High School Gymnasium will be open to pick up academic materials and lunches.  If possible, we ask that you help us to manage the number of individuals in the building by following the timelines established below:</p>
<table><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<p>Access to these spaces will be controlled in accordance with the CDC established guidelines of fewer than ten people.  If there is a line outside of the building, consider staying in your car until we can allow you in.  For anyone outside of town, we will be delivering materials via our school bus routes.  Work will begin to load those materials beginning at 9:45 and will continue until complete.</p>
<p>Following the School Board meeting that was held on Monday, March 23 I’d like to take an opportunity to inform you of the following:</p>
<ul><li>The Groton Area Prom has been postponed to a date TBD.  We acknowledge that it may not be possible to effectively reschedule this event, but out of care for the students whose school experience has been stripped, it was decided that if possible, we should try to allow for this event when it becomes safe and prudent to do so.<p>Given the possibility that this event may not take place, we are encouraging anyone with a tuxedo rental to cancel their rentals and for those who have not yet purchased dresses, shoes, etc. to please don’t go out and spend your money on those items until we can establish for certain that this event will be rescheduled.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The music trip scheduled for mid-April has been cancelled.  Our music instructors will begin work to obtain the maximum refund possible.</li>
<li>Graduation is not currently being moved.  There is wide agreement among board members and administrators that our class of 2020 has earned (or will have earned J) the opportunity for a graduation ceremony.  We will continue to monitor the guidelines and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and the South Dakota Department of Health pertaining to appropriate sizes for gatherings as this important date approaches.</li>
<li>We anticipate learning more from our state government officials today about what the immediate future holds for public schools in South Dakota and will announce any programming changes accordingly.</li>
<li>Now, more than ever, the concept of parents and educators being partners in the education of our children is being tested.  As educators, we are leaning on families and students to help in ensuring that our students are not falling behind academically during these times.  Please join us in requiring mindful completion of student assignments and work with an emphasis on learning the material as opposed to rapid completion to check an item off a to-do list.<p>Communication is much different – even if more important - right now due to our lack of face-to-face contact with our students.  We ask that you or your children be available for phone calls or email as appropriate from teachers and school staff and that you or your children will actively reach out for support as they need it.  We are still here, and still working on behalf of our students.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://5il.co/dzzg" target="_blank">Letter to Parents - March 20, 2020</a></p>
<p>Dear Families of Groton Area School Students,</p>
<p>The faculty of the Groton Area School District has been provided with a framework from which to build alternative forms of instruction beginning next week.  We will be hosting a virtual meeting with all of them on Monday morning to further clarify our plan and help to provide any support that we can.  I am very happy to say that they are eager to be back in touch with their students providing educational opportunities.</p>
<p>Following our staff meeting we are asking our teachers to reach out to families by phone to establish a line of communication, check in, and find the answer to four questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you aware of what our plan for the coming week is?</li>
<li>Do you have access to meals for your children? Do you want to participate in the free meals [Details below] being offered by the District?</li>
<li>What is the best way for us to communicate with you?</li>
<li>What is your access to technology devices and/or Internet?</li>
</ul>
<p>They will also try to answer any questions you have about what your next steps should be.</p>
<p>In order for us to accomplish our goals, we need to be able to get supplies and materials into the hands of the students.  This will take place on Wednesday, March 25 from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM.  During this process, we want to ensure that we can be mindful of the recommendations of health officials concerning the size of group gatherings, personal hygiene for clean hands, and social distancing.  The following schedule of material pick-up has been established for in-town residents.  </p>
<p>If possible, we ask that you make every effort to follow the timelines provided.  If families are unable to make the established times work, they will not be turned away, but access may be managed if certain times become too busy.  Each building will be open for pick-up from 7:00 AM until 12:00 PM.  Pick-up from the elementary will be held in the Elementary Commons.  Pick-up from the MS/HS will be held in the GHS Gymnasium. </p>

<p>Beginning at 9:45, we will be loading the school buses with materials for every student on a regular bus route whose materials haven’t been picked up.  The buses will run their normal routes, stopping to drop off all of the materials for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Materials to be picked up and/or delivered on Wednesday will include student computers and chargers for students in grades 6-8, coursework and materials (e.g. textbooks) needed for the remainder of the week, personal items from student lockers, and school meals for three days.</p>
<p>In the event that the school closure is extended, a similar system will be employed for the return of completed coursework and distribution of new material and meals on Monday, March 30 with adjustments made as necessary based on lessons learned from the initial distribution.  The current plan is to provide material exchanges on a week-by-week basis on Mondays with the exception of school meals which will be provided on Mondays and Wednesdays. </p>
<p>During the week, staff will be available via email or telephone from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM daily to answer questions, and provide support and assistance to students.  There will not be any face-to-face meetings or contacts made during the closure.</p>
<p><strong>School Meals</strong></p>
<p>The District will be providing free meals to all enrolled students regardless of income who wish to participate.  Meals for three days will be sent along with classroom materials on Wednesday, March 25.  If the closure is to continue, additional meals will be provided on Mondays and Wednesdays at the Groton Area Elementary from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM.  Pending approval, we plan to also distribute meals to our out-of-town students through our transportation services (bus routes).  There is no charge for these meals.  <strong>One change from the way we’ve provided meals for this week will be that students have to be physically present to receive a meal.  This is a USDA requirement which has not yet been waived.</strong>  We are encouraging all families to participate in this service.</p>
<p>We appreciate the support of our community as we work through these days.  Among all of the uncertainty, many have reached out to provide support for students and families in need.  I’ve always felt that our communities are supportive of our children through action.  We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to proceed the implementation of these flexible learning opportunities.  If there is anything that we can do to help you support your children or your families please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>On Tuesday, March 17 the Groton Area Administrative Team met in discussion on providing flexible learning opportunities for our students moving forward.  In particular, how can we provide some educational services during the week of March 23-27 given the known closure through that time.  This afternoon, a draft plan was sent to our teachers seeking their input and clarifying questions.  Further revisions will be made on Thursday with the anticipation that we can provide a plan to our students and parents on Thursday afternoon or Friday.  Be on the lookout for information coming pertaining to learning opportunities for our students.</p>
<p>The sack lunch opportunities currently being provided will continue through the week of March 27.  Please take advantage of this service if it would be helpful to you.</p>
<p>We’ve received notification that the April 4, 2020 ACT testing date has been postponed to June 13, 2020.  Those students who had registered for that test should have received notification from ACT regarding the postponement.</p>
<p>As a community, please continue to follow the guidelines and recommendations of health officials including frequent hand washing with soap and water, practicing “social-distancing,” and not meeting in groups of larger than ten people.  We are all being called upon to do our part in reducing the impact of this situation.</p>

<p>The Groton Area School District, through the contributions of generous community members, will be offering free lunches to children aged 1 through grade 12 regardless of whether a family meets income criteria for free or reduced priced meals.  Sack lunch meals will be served from the Groton Area Elementary school main entrance from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM daily from Tuesday, March 17 through Friday, March 20.  Lunches will be "grab and go" and provided at no cost.  It is critically important for all community members that all individuals follow CDC guidelines for staying home if you are sick.</p>
<p>To help assist those members of our school community that live outside of the town of Groton and wish to receive meals, we want to assist in getting those meals to you.  Please contact Joe Schwan at <a href="mailto:Joe.Schwan@k12.sd.us">Joe.Schwan@k12.sd.us</a> or 605-397-2351 (leave a message if no answer) for assistance in getting this service established for your family.</p>
<p>As the week progresses, we will be evaluating the effectiveness of this program and making modifications as necessary as well as developing contingencies in the event this service is required for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>If you wish to help financially support this important work, please contact Amanda Morehouse at the school business office at <a href="mailto:Amanda.Morehouse@k12.sd.us">Amanda.Morehouse@k12.sd.us</a> or 605-397-2351.</p>
<p>In addition, there is currently food available for families at Ken's Food Fair in Groton.  Carts of donated food are available at the front of the store to help families with their nutritional needs.  If you or someone you know is in need of support, stop at Ken's and take what you need.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.grotonarea.com/article/208469?org=groton" target="_blank">Groton Area School District Closure</a></p>
<p>At the recommendation of Governor Noem, the Groton Area School District will be closed for the week of March 13-22.  There will be no school on Monday, March 16, Tuesday, March 17 or Wednesday, March 18 in addition to our pre-planned spring break.  Each attendance center will undergo additional cleaning measures during the extended break.</p>
<p>The facilities will be closed for any and all activities for the duration of the break beginning at 4:00 PM on Friday, March 13.  OST will run as usual through the end of the day on Friday, March 13.</p>
<p>Students enrolled in NSU E-learning courses and dual credit courses should continue to monitor their online classrooms and watch for correspondence from their instructors.  Board of Regents institutions are currently planning to resume classes on Monday, March 23 and the NSU E-learning center has a previously announced plan for continuity of learning for those students.</p>
<p>One of the stated goals of Governor Noem’s recommendation is to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  In order for that goal to be realized, it is important that our students and families continue to practice social distancing and refrain from being around groups of people as well as maintaining and practicing good hygiene.  We must be collectively judicious about our behaviors to prevent the spread of this virus upon returning to school.</p>
<p>Many questions still exist about what these decisions mean moving forward.  We will provide updates as we are able.</p>

<p>The South Dakota Department of Health is providing guidance and leadership to all South Dakota residents including public school districts regarding the nationwide concerns over the spread of COVID-19 also known as the Coronavirus. </p>
<p>Precautions recommended by the Department of Health to help in avoiding illness include</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow CDC’s Travel Health Notices if you are traveling internationally.</li>
<li>Contact your medical provider if you become ill after international travel.</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze (with a tissue or into your sleeve).   </li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or alcohol-based hand gel with at least 60% alcohol).</li>
<li>Stay home if you are sick.</li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations are drawing new and increased attention with the widespread concern over the Coronavirus but are good advice any time and would be effective against many kinds of illness.  We will continue to encourage good hand washing techniques by our students and staff members and ask that students stay home when they’re sick.  We currently have a good supply of appropriate disinfecting surface cleaners used by the custodial staff in cleaning and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces.  We continue to have hand sanitizer available throughout each building for general use.</p>
<p>We will continue to follow the guidance of the CDC and state and local health officials about preparedness and responsiveness to this public health risk.  We appreciate your understanding and support of these guidelines as we all work together to protect our kids and our communities. </p>
