<p><strong>2:47 p.m. - April 17, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Buildings Closed, Learning to Continue</p>

<p>Dear District 99 Community:</p>

<p>This afternoon at his daily press conference, Governor Pritzker suspended all in person learning for the remainder of the school year, due to COVID-19. We learned this information in real-time, along with you and with the rest of the state of Illinois.</p>

<p>We anticipated this development and have been working behind the scenes to extend our Remote Learning for our students. We will be in touch soon regarding the logistics of how we will end the school year remotely. In addition, we have been brainstorming and planning and will soon be sharing alternate plans for many of our cherished events, including graduation. </p>

<p>This pandemic has impacted each of us in so many ways, but in particular the 1,210 members of the Class of 2020. Please know that we want to honor each one of you and celebrate your accomplishments. We will share these details with seniors shortly.</p>

<p>This crisis has brought out the best in people, and I’m thankful for all of those in our District 99 community who have helped others. District 99 staff has provided over 20,000 meals to students in need throughout the community. There is a true need here, more than ever. Please <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/Bn8uGvH7k4wXhQziHIUx3Q~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgeztIP0RZaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3NkOTkub3JnL25ld3MvMTY3ODQ0MC9kaXN0cmljdC05OS1tZWFsLXBpY2stdXAtcGxhbi1mb3Itd2Vlay1vZi1hcHJpbC02LTIwMjBXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgBIyAeaXkpatQRSE2picm93bmluZ0Bjc2Q5OS5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">click here</a></strong> to see the schedule.</p>

<p>We’ve also donated over 30,000 pieces of Personal Protection Equipment from our inventory to support our local hospital, Good Samaritan. Using our 3D printers, staff members have been working seven days a week to produce nearly 4,000 face shields and distributed them to numerous health organizations. See photos and learn more <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/Z51oYoFVTxr-3tnI9Lw-Zg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgeztIP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmxpY2tyLmNvbS9waG90b3MvZGlzdHJpY3RfOTkvYWxidW1zLzcyMTU3NzEzODA0NzM0MjE2VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoASMgHml5KWrUEUhNqYnJvd25pbmdAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. Thank you to our community members who helped us exceed our fundraising goal for this campaign.</p>

<p>To support our students and families in greatest need during these unprecedented times, the District 99 Education Foundation has established the COVID-19 Family Support Fund. Funds will be used to purchase gift cards from local businesses that provide groceries, food, and other household essential items to support these families. <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/Ct2LucXIYtWD4neNxJ7vwQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgeztIP0RPaHR0cHM6Ly9kOTllZi56MnN5c3RlbXMuY29tL25wL2NsaWVudHMvZDk5ZWYvZG9uYXRpb24uanNwP2NhbXBhaWduPTUmJnRlc3Q9dHJ1ZVcHc2Nob29sbUIKAEjIB5peSlq1BFITamJyb3duaW5nQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">Donate here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I’m proud of how we’ve responded to this crisis, from helping others to continuing to stay at home. I am confident we will continue to show patience and kindness to one another as this continues. </p>

<p>Thank you, </p>

                    <div class="news-list-expanded__item-body">
                        <p>Good morning! First, I would like to thank everyone for their participation, cooperation, and patience during our first few days of Extended Remote Learning last week. I know we shared a lot of information, and this is a whole new way of “doing school.” While there were a few bumps in the road, overall it was a successful week. </p>

<p>As we move into our second week, I wanted to share a few clarifications and opportunities.</p>

<p><u><strong>Grading</strong></u></p>

<p>As explained in <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/VoWhhAlc5xKmgYDrRgs0_g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgdcLXP0RUaHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xSDRJRFhfQ2lhNk9BZW9Tby1ZNlNwcGlkQWFiNmE1bUcydF9pRVFUWGJNVS9lZGl0VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAFePlF4wZWdPUhNqYnJvd25pbmdAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">this Remote Learning Guide</a>, grades earned for assignments during the period of remote learning can cause a student’s semester grade to go up but not down. Grades for assignments that were completed prior to March 13 but not entered into Home Access Center until after March 13 will count toward the semester grade. For example, a student might have taken a test on March 12, but grades were not entered until April 6. Since that work was not part of remote learning, it still figures into a student’s semester grade. Any student who was absent and missed an assignment prior to March 13 should contact the teacher to make up that work.</p>

<p>During Remote Learning, teachers will continue to enter grades into <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/eHlgp-NZma-SrEzP5adPFg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgdcLXP0QYaHR0cDovL3d3dy5jc2Q5OS5vcmcvSEFDVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAFePlF4wZWdPUhNqYnJvd25pbmdAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">Home Access Center</a>. For some students, this might mean that a grade will drop; for others, the grade might rise. If a student’s grade has risen at the end of the semester, that is the grade the student will receive for the semester grade. If a student’s grade has dropped because of assignments during remote learning, the grade will revert back to what it was without the remote learning grades. Students should concentrate on the learning and not worry about how an assignment is impacting their overall semester grade. Teachers are focusing on essential learning, so it is important for everyone to do their best on all assignments.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to note that if a student is not engaged in the work that is required and/or is not completing assignments or assessments, a semester grade of “incomplete” might be assigned until the work has been finished. Any student who has a question about their grade should contact the teacher. </p>

<p><u><strong>Attendance/Indicators of Student Engagement</strong></u></p>

<p>Students receive an email with an attendance form Monday-Thursday; they should check email and complete the form by 6 p.m. If they fail to do so, they will be marked absent, and this absence will show up in Home Access Center.</p>

<p>On Fridays, teachers will mark students absent who have not been engaging in their classwork at a sufficient level. This absence also will appear in Home Access Center and should be interpreted as a message that the student is falling behind in their work. Students who are not sufficiently engaged in their work risk earning an “incomplete” for the course and will have to make up that work at a later time. </p>

<p><u><strong>Student Town Hall</strong></u></p>

<p>This Thursday at 4 p.m., I will partner with Student Advisory Council to host a student town hall meeting where we can answer questions that students might have about remote learning or related activities. I’ll send out more information later this week. </p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this email.

                        District 99 Meal Pick Up

                        <p><strong>District 99 Meal Pick Up Starting April 14, 2020 </strong></p>

<p lang="es"><strong>(Espanol debajo)</strong></p>

<p>Community High School District 99, Downers Grove Grade School District 58, and Woodridge School District 68 are partnering together to create the <strong>Wood-Grove Feeding Our Future Cooperative</strong>, a new collaborative community effort to ensure all children ages 0-18 in our communities can receive a breakfast and lunch six days per week. These three school districts partnered with their food service vendors–Aramark, Open Kitchens and Chartwells–and their transportation provider–First Student–to launch this initiative. </p>

<p><strong>Beginning Tuesday, April 14</strong>, Districts 58, 68 and 99 will provide all children ages 0-18, who reside within the community, the option to pick up free breakfasts and free lunches at a variety of locations. </p>

<p>Meal pickup will take place on Tuesdays and Fridays via the following schedule:</p>

<p><strong>Tuesdays</strong>: Children can pick up three breakfasts and three lunches, including milk.<br><strong>Fridays</strong>:  Children can pick up three breakfasts and three lunches, including milk.</p>

<p>Note for District 58 families: In support of the Wood-Grove Feeding Our Future Cooperative, District 58 will suspend its direct-door meal delivery and encourages families to pick up meals at the location most convenient for them. </p>

<p>Woodridge 68 families please note that Willow Creek and Jefferson will no longer serve as meal pick-up sites. Please use any one of the other sites listed below.</p>

<p>Woodridge School District 68 will continue to donate leftover meals and milk to the West Suburban Community Pantry each week.</p>

<p>These meals are in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National School Lunch Program guidelines and will be reimbursed by the USDA through the Illinois State Board of Education.</p>

<p>The Wood-Grove Feeding Our Future Cooperative is intended for children ages 0-18 who reside within District 99, 58 and 68 boundaries.

                        <h2>Transitioning to Remote Learning</h2>

<p>Greetings South High students and families,</p>

<p>I hope that this message finds you all healthy and managing these unprecedented times as best you can.  I certainly miss seeing our staff and students on a daily basis, but I understand that by staying apart, we are contributing to the overall good of our society.</p>

<p>Last Friday Dr. Thiele, District 99 Superintendent, shared the district’s Remote Learning Plan that begins this Wednesday (tomorrow). If you haven’t already done so, <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/vKO9Q6WDIaj4R0j-5eXDiA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgbc9LP4QHAWh0dHA6Ly90cmFjay5zcGUuc2Nob29sbWVzc2VuZ2VyLmNvbS9mL2EvaDJsNExLQlZLUEdmd2xvTWF2NjVxd35-L0FBQUFBUUF-L1JnUmdiTHJiUDBSVWFIUjBjSE02THk5a2IyTnpMbWR2YjJkc1pTNWpiMjB2Wkc5amRXMWxiblF2WkM4eFNEUkpSRmhmUTJsaE5rOUJaVzlUYnkxWk5sTndjR2xrUVdGaU5tRTFiVWN5ZEY5cFJWRlVXR0pOVlM5bFpHbDBWd2R6WTJodmIyeHRRZ29BQUZ1SGkxN1pNbHQ4VWhObGMyTm9kMkZ5ZEhwQVkzTmtPVGt1YjNKbldBUUFBQUFCVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAMubjF7PVwZRUhNlc2Nod2FydHpAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">be sure to read this document </a>carefully so that you can do your part in making remote learning a success. The document also includes important information about meal pick-up for this week. You can find that information and all of the past communication from our school and district on our website <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/KhXkqCy4O6z1mNtYOyKO2A~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgbc9LP0S_aHR0cDovL3RyYWNrLnNwZS5zY2hvb2xtZXNzZW5nZXIuY29tL2YvYS9Ub3FOZ3pYNnRkR1FjbXJheDFSWG5Bfn4vQUFBQUFRQX4vUmdSZ2JMcmJQMFFkYUhSMGNITTZMeTkzZDNjdVkzTmtPVGt1YjNKbkwzVndaR0YwWlhOWEIzTmphRzl2YkcxQ0NnQUFXNGVMWHRreVczeFNFMlZ6WTJoM1lYSjBla0JqYzJRNU9TNXZjbWRZQkFBQUFBRX5XB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAy5uMXs9XBlFSE2VzY2h3YXJ0ekBjc2Q5OS5vcmdYBAAAAAE~" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have recorded a video where I expand on some of the key points of our Remote Learning Plan and also share expectations for moving forward. While I have sent video messages before, this one is especially important as we transition to Remote Learning.<strong> I strongly encourage everyone to take the time to <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/DMJYQpyo2hDtkinETQwoSA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgbc9LP0Q8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1NaWU4Wi0wNHItRSZmZWF0dXJlPXlvdXR1LmJlVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAMubjF7PVwZRUhNlc2Nod2FydHpAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">watch the video.</a></strong></p>

<p>For those not inclined to watch the video, a less detailed summary follows:</p>

<p>I need to stress to you that Remote Learning is not an eLearning day  The month of April does not represent a snow day. Unfortunately, this is school for at least the next month.  Parents - we need to show our students the strength of our partnership. We need you to help get them out of bed and engaged in their school work.  </p>

<p>Many things will stay the same as before we stopped meeting face-to-face:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will be expected to participate fully - every day!</li>
	<li>We will take attendance every day. Monday through Thursday - students must check in on an attendance form that will be emailed to you each day. Friday - teachers will mark your attendance based on how well you engaged in the lessons and activities during the week.</li>
	<li>The same behavioral expectations that we have of you in the building will be expected in this virtual environment. Exhibiting the Mustang Way transfers to every situation in which you find yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students should spend their time focusing on learning.  We are spending too much time worrying about grades. One of the things that I heard during the two weeks prior to spring break was that some students were not too concerned about engaging in school because the governor said that their grade could not go down. We expect learning to continue. I assure you that IF you give your best effort in all of your classes and concentrate on learning, your grade will not end up lower than it was at the time (when all of the assignments given) before you left on March 13 were recorded.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your teachers will continue to grade as they always have - albeit it will likely be based on different methods.</li>
	<li>If you do as well as you should or could, you will get the grade that you earn.</li>
	<li>If you choose not to engage in the lesson and/or do not demonstrate learning, you will receive an Incomplete grade until you do demonstrate learning.</li>
	<li>Some of you did not have the grade you desired in March. You have an opportunity now to continue to demonstrate learning and raise that grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have heard me say it many times, focus on learning and the grade will take care of itself.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to acknowledge the many cancellations that we are experiencing.  Spring sports have come to a halt. The One-Acts, the musical, the Mustang Trot, concerts, recitals, talent shows, induction ceremonies, assemblies, clubs, activities have all experienced cancellations. Seniors especially are feeling anxious about senior activities like prom and graduation. Please know that I believe that the entire high school experience is what makes our school great. We have a diverse student body and a wide variety of activities, sports, and interests that add to what makes our school special. We will continue to look at all possibilities in trying to make sure that some of these key events still happen.  One thing that has proven certain about this situation is the uncertainty around it.  We will continue to make decisions that take into account all of the information that we have, while ensuring that our staff and students are all kept safe.</p>

<p>Even though we can’t all be together in person, we are still pretty fortunate that we can be together through the internet. More importantly, we are together in the spirit of community that is South High. I am missing everyone terribly, but I believe in our families and the trust that they have in our school. I believe in our staff. Over the past three weeks, they have proven to be models of what learning looks like. They were not all prepared to teach in an online environment, but they are doing everything possible to adjust because of their care for you.  And I - WE - every staff member, believes in you. You have been dealt a challenging set of circumstances, but you can do it….and when you need help, we have the people here ready to stand alongside you and figure it out.</p>

<p>If we all give our best effort, that will be good enough. We are here if you need anything...just let us know. Stay well and I will reach out again soon.</p>

<p>All my best,</p>

<p>The video is a little longer than I had intended, but there was a lot of information to cover! Topics include the schedule, how students will be graded, tips for success, plans for extra-curricular activities, sports, and senior events for the rest of the year, and how to stay connected to DGN.  One note of clarification regarding the grading I explain in the video: if a student receives an Incomplete for the semester because s/he did not complete the work or didn’t show mastery of the work, the student will have an opportunity to earn credit for the course once we are no longer in the remote learning environment. The state will provide guidance on how this impacts the letter grade and GPA.  In the meantime, students, please stay engaged in your coursework and focus on the learning, not the grade.  </p>

<p>I also invite all parents/guardians to join me in a virtual meeting with Parents’ Club on Wednesday, April 8 at 7 p.m. I’ll do my best to provide insight into the decisions that we’ve already made as well as what we are planning to do if we don’t return to school this year. I’ll also answer questions that you submit ahead of time. You may email questions to Parents’ Club at <strong><a href="mailto:dgnorthpc@gmail.com">dgnorthpc@gmail.com</a></strong> by Tuesday at noon. <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/_ySKRYj9yv4HWyM2MtsJAg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgbLrNP0RIaHR0cHM6Ly91czA0d2ViLnpvb20udXMvai8zODIzODkxOTE_cHdkPWJFTjZUaXRJUVhGS09GZGpRVzFSWjNvNGRFVk1RVDA5VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAE2Hi17ZMpRoUhNqYnJvd25pbmdAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">Here </a></strong>is the link to Wednesday’s meeting. I plan to offer additional parent meetings as well as a similar meeting for students sometime in the next few weeks; stay tuned for additional information.</p>

<p>Thank you, in advance, for your participation, patience, and understanding as we all navigate extended Remote Learning for the first time. As Dr. Thiele said in his message last Friday, all we can ask is that each person commits to doing their best and to extend grace and forgiveness to ourselves and to others when things might not go as well as we would have liked. Together we will make it through the challenges and celebrate on the other side.  </p>

<p>Take care, stay healthy, and remember to practice social distancing.</p>

In addition, we will continue to support our students’ emotional needs and <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/-D_UZJsNIw6Hsa8R0tW2FA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0RZaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3NkOTkub3JnL25ld3MvMTY3ODQ0MC9kaXN0cmljdC05OS1tZWFsLXBpY2stdXAtcGxhbi1mb3Itd2Vlay1vZi1hcHJpbC02LTIwMjBXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAB2uHXiIjBUFSEWh0aGllbGVAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">offer meals</a> to any student in need. </p>

<p>We have created this “<a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/lTbVW6OACfEY_wS0I6asdA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0RgaHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xSDRJRFhfQ2lhNk9BZW9Tby1ZNlNwcGlkQWFiNmE1bUcydF9pRVFUWGJNVS9lZGl0P3VzcD1zaGFyaW5nVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAAdrh14iIwVBUhFodGhpZWxlQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">D99 Remote Learning Days Guidance for Students and Families</a>” document to guide you through our new learning environment. This Remote Learning Plan is based on the Illinois State Board of Education guidelines, teacher feedback from our two weeks before break, student feedback that was collected and analyzed, and parent feedback that we have received. </p>

<p><u><strong>Highlights of Remote Learning Days</strong></u></p>

<ul>
<li>District 99 will continue with Remote Learning Days throughout the month of April and will follow a “block schedule.” To prepare for this new schedule, Monday, April 6 and Tuesday, April 7 have been designated as Teacher Planning Days. There will be <strong>no student instruction or responsibilities </strong>on these days. On Wednesday, April 8, our Remote Learning schedule will begin. <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/uvg4oJ0bv0RieapE8NgfoA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0R3aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xSDRJRFhfQ2lhNk9BZW9Tby1ZNlNwcGlkQWFiNmE1bUcydF9pRVFUWGJNVS9lZGl0P3RzPTVlODYxNTQzI2hlYWRpbmc9aC5oZjc1M25sbnB3cGdXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAB2uHXiIjBUFSEWh0aGllbGVAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the schedule. </li>
	<li>Teachers will use Google classroom to post all lessons, assignments and reminders by 9 a.m. the day the class is scheduled to meet.</li>
	<li>Students should check their email regularly. Classes may or may not meet virtually (synchronously) during the assigned block time. If teachers do hold a class virtually, they will do so at their regularly assigned time.</li>
	<li>Every Friday is reserved as a wrap-up of the week and for students to seek additional help from and connections with their teachers, if needed. Teachers will be communicating their Office Hours to students; these times are when they are available in “real time” to help. </li>
	<li>For attendance, <strong>students must check in once each day, Monday through Thursday, by 6 p.m.</strong> on this <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/3U9DVViJ6mq32gWJap-3cQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0RpaHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZm9ybXMvZC8xMWIwQ1Q3ZVBzZDVJSzlwN0R5am5wbmpKbnBuXy1pblNOMVZhdVkxUDRrTS92aWV3Zm9ybT9lZGl0X3JlcXVlc3RlZD10cnVlVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAAdrh14iIwVBUhFodGhpZWxlQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">Google form</a>. If students do not check in or call in absent, they will be marked as absent. If a student does not engage in learning during the week, they will be marked absent by the teacher on Friday. We ask that you please fill out <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/dDZ66IWNTFf3YiaGZLhOAA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0RjaHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZm9ybXMvZC9lLzFGQUlwUUxTZFdYU0pydWxTSzBVXzVvNE9JQXdqQlpPMGVpYm1JcTRneVluVFp2MUdlb09BSXN3L3ZpZXdmb3JtVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAAdrh14iIwVBUhFodGhpZWxlQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">this form</a> to report positive confirmations of a student or a family member in a student’s household.</li>
	<li>Teachers will continue to use the electronic gradebook (<a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/VpL6SSc5eCjbVM4I8CMyxA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0QYaHR0cDovL3d3dy5jc2Q5OS5vcmcvSEFDVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAAdrh14iIwVBUhFodGhpZWxlQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">Home Access Center</a>) to track assignments and record grades. Although semester grades cannot go down during Remote Learning, a student may receive an incomplete if they do not participate in remote learning.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Remote Learning Days are school days</strong>. Students are expected to keep up with their assignments and engage in learning activities as they would during the regular calendar year. This is the best way to ensure that learning progresses during this time. We also want to make sure that we are helping to care for students.  </li>
</ul>
<p>I ask that students and families all keep in mind that everyone is new to Remote Learning. It is ok to make mistakes - it is absolutely expected that we all will. I ask that everyone only worry about what they can control and be patient. Please do your best. Your best is enough.</p>

<p><u><strong>Continuation of Meals</strong></u></p>

<p>In partnership with our affiliated school districts, District 99 will continue to provide food for those in need. Please <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/-D_UZJsNIw6Hsa8R0tW2FA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0RZaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3NkOTkub3JnL25ld3MvMTY3ODQ0MC9kaXN0cmljdC05OS1tZWFsLXBpY2stdXAtcGxhbi1mb3Itd2Vlay1vZi1hcHJpbC02LTIwMjBXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAB2uHXiIjBUFSEWh0aGllbGVAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">click here</a></strong> to see the process for next week, starting Monday, April 6.</p>

Janes Avenue for those who need help. <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/cRuGepuItH9gKS-I90iOXw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0Q4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmlsLndvb2RyaWRnZS5pbC51cy9DaXZpY0FsZXJ0cy5hc3B4P0FJRD04ODNXB3NjaG9vbG1CCgAAB2uHXiIjBUFSEWh0aGllbGVAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">Click here</a></strong> for details.</p>

<p><u><strong>Thank You</strong></u></p>

<p>This is not an ideal situation. We are asking for patience, flexibility and most of all, grace, during these challenging times. We are asking everyone to do their best. We will learn and adjust as we move forward, and welcome your feedback along the way. You can find all of the information related to these changes at csd99.org/updates. Our <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/ExoSK6sf3azpoiuWIQ0RuQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgaJ6HP0QqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3NkOTkub3JnL2Rnbi9wb3NpdGl2ZWx5LW5vcnRoVwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAAdrh14iIwVBUhFodGhpZWxlQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">Positively North</a> and <a href="https://www.csd99.org/dgs/mustangway" target="_blank">Mustang Way</a> programs help us to foster a positive school climate, where we are all “respectful, responsible and engaged.”  Now more than ever before we should be inspired by these ideals.</p>

<p>Although our society is full of uncertainty right now, I’m confident that keeping our teachers and learning in your child’s life will help provide some degree of normalcy and stability. </p>

<p>Thank you again for your patience and support. Together, we will do our best for our students.</p>

<p>I hope you all are doing well and staying safe.</p>

<p>Governor Pritzker has officially closed all public schools until May 1. District 99 will continue with Remote Learning Days throughout the month of April. We will share details of our Remote Learning days by this Friday, April 3.</p>

<p>Currently, our academic team is working through other details, such as grading, attendance procedures and other expectations. Their work is based in part on the survey feedback conducted last week along with the new state guidelines on Remote Learning. Last week, we asked both students and teachers to find out what worked and what could be improved upon for Remote Learning moving forward. We also received extensive guidance from the state last week that provided us with many options and expectations around teaching and learning in the new format, which we have been processing this week. We will share these details with you by this Friday on what our plans are for next week and moving forward. </p>

<p>As we’ve shared, District 99 will continue to provide food for those in need. We will follow up by Friday with the future schedule and procedures. Please check your email for procedures. In the meantime, please know that the Village of Woodridge is hosting a Woodridge Drive-Up Food Pantry on Friday, April 3 from 3 to 4:30 p.m., at Cypress Cove, 8301 S.

                        <p>Dear District 99 Community:</p>

<p>As we begin our spring break 2020, it is not what any of us anticipated. Everyone has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you all for your support, flexibility and patience as we all navigate this crisis together.</p>

<p>We received guidance from the Governor and the Illinois State Board of Education late in the evening yesterday. At this point, we are still reviewing this guidance, which includes what the requirements (i.e., grading, attendance, schedule, and other expectations) are for remote learning. Although our buildings are closed, our educators will continue to keep learning and student achievement moving forward after spring break. Please watch for additional information next week.</p>

<p>Although we need to review and interpret this new information, we want to provide as much information about what we know at this point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharing our Schedule: District 99 will observe spring break next week, Monday, March 30 through Friday, April 3. We are tentatively planning to return to school on Wednesday,  April 8, which is when the Governor’s Emergency Proclamation is set to expire; however, we will be monitoring the situation and this date may change. </li>
	<li>Planning for Standardized Testing: The SAT/PSAT planned for April 14, 2020 has been canceled. For many students, this SAT was the only free opportunity to take a college entrance exam. Plans are underway to reschedule this exam for current juniors to take the SAT in the fall. As soon as we hear what the final plans are, we will share them with you.  We have notified students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) classes what the plans are for testing. We will follow up in the coming weeks with additional information.</li>
	<li>Continuing Meals for those in Need: After spring break, District 99 will continue to provide food for those in need. We will follow up next week with the future schedule and procedures. Please check your email for pick-up and sign-up procedures.</li>
	<li>Staying Healthy: During these stressful times, it’s helpful to separate fact from fiction; <a href="http://www.fema.gov/coronavirus-rumor-control" target="_blank">see new information</a> from the Federal Emergency Management Association and information from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control</a>. In addition to your physical health, please take care of your mental health as well; please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/csd99.org/d99-sel-resources" target="_blank">our resources</a>. </li>
	<li>Staying Connected: District 99 continues to come together online. Find links to our <a href="https://www.csd99.org/departments/social-media-directory" target="_blank">social media channels</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dgspride%20OR%20%23wearedgn%20OR%20%2399learns%20OR%20%40Dist_99%20OR%20%40downersnorth%20OR%20%40downerssouth&amp;src=typd&amp;f=live" target="_blank">see what’s happening on Twitter</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please know that as we move forward, we are committed to continuing to provide opportunities for learning and meeting the nutritional requirements of all of our students wo require meal assistance. We will continue to update our page at <a href="/updates">www.csd99.org/updates</a> with all messages we issue and other important information. In the meantime, please follow the guidelines to keep you and your family healthy and safe.</p>

<p>We know that you likely have many questions and that many unknowns remain. What we do know, however, is that we will continue to stay positive and support one another through this difficult time in our world’s history.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Stay At Home Order Enforcement: Parks &amp; Facilities</strong></h4>

<p>To The Downers Grove Community:<br>
 <br>
To help prevent the further spread of COVID-19 in Illinois and protect our friends, neighbors, and vulnerable populations, Governor Pritker adopted a Stay at Home Order which began on March 21, 2020. <br>
 <br>
It is CRUCIAL that you follow CDC recommendations for social distancing due to COVID-19. This means keeping a 6-foot distance from others. We encourage you to enjoy fresh air and outdoor recreation through ‘dispersed recreation’ by participating in outdoor activities AWAY from others.<br>
 <br>
According to the Stay at Home Order, parks remain open to allow folks to walk, hike or jog. Areas designed for group activities such as playgrounds, courts and sports fields are off limits. These areas do not provide the opportunity to practice social distancing.<br>
 <br>
In support of the Stay at Home Order, playgrounds throughout the community are in the process of being cordoned off with caution tape and additional signage is being added to the areas and facilities that are closed.  <br>
 <br>
For your health and safety, the Village of Downers Grove, Downers Grove Park District, District 58 and District 99 urge you to comply with the Stay at Home Order and avoid gathering at playgrounds, tennis courts, basketball courts, and sports fields.<br>
 <br>
Please keep in mind that every action we take as individuals during this time affects the entire community.  <br>
 <br>
Thank you for cooperation during these challenging times. <br>

As you can see, we are trying to keep students as connected to DGN as possible during these challenging times. Any support you can provide at home regarding helping students complete school work would be greatly appreciated. In addition, please encourage your child to get involved in some of the fun virtual activities we have planned for this week, and for those who need it, to check out the <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/9SFvl5vVo1HLggV7k8aA8g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgW7A-P0Q0aHR0cHM6Ly9zaXRlcy5nb29nbGUuY29tL2NzZDk5Lm9yZy9kOTktc2VsLXJlc291cmNlc1cHc2Nob29sbUIKAAC-fHpemX_SJlITamJyb3duaW5nQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">Counseling and Student Support Services website</a></strong>.There’s information on this website for parents/guardians, too, so hopefully you will check it out.</p>

<p>Also, I wanted to share <strong><a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/n_pGbcNUm2J58q7AL1Cuig~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgW7A-P0QbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc21vcmUuY29tLzUycjQ5VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAAL58el6Zf9ImUhNqYnJvd25pbmdAY3NkOTkub3JnWAQAAAAB" target="_blank">this opportunity</a></strong> for parents/guardians.The law firm Franczek has partnered with the DuPage Regional Office of Education and Glen Ellyn School District 41 to provide a series of livestreams designed to help families manage crisis in a healthy and constructive way.The program will include coping skills geared toward families, how to harness the power of community to help children, and practical tips to ensure we continue to thrive during this difficult time. While District 99 is not involved in producing the livestreams, I wanted to share this resource with you in case you find it helpful.</p>

<p>We at District 99 will update you with information regarding school and learning activities after spring break once we receive guidance from state officials. In the meantime, I hope you are well and that you are enjoying this extra time with your children.  I also hope to see you sometime soon in person!</p>

<p>Whether you are a student, parent/guardian, or a member of the staff, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to you.  I continue to be impressed and humbled by the work being done in and around our school community.

<p>Franczek, the law firm that works with District 99, has partnered with the DuPage Regional Office of Education and Glen Ellyn School District 41 to provide a series of livestreams designed to help families manage crisis in a healthy and constructive way. <strong> <a href="http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/HO_I1ChUZD8RPnKA84fV9w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgW6M1P0QbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc21vcmUuY29tLzUycjQ5VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoAALVvel6Zf5OiUhFodGhpZWxlQGNzZDk5Lm9yZ1gEAAAAAQ~~" target="_blank">The program</a></strong> is designed to help us focus on those things in our life that are in our control and how to harness the power of community to help us all thrive during this difficult time.  This program<strong> </strong>is also linked on the site mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Finally, as we complete the Continuity of Learning day tomorrow and head into spring break, Ms. Martinez (Student Activities) will be sending every student the Spring Break Challenge.  You will have an opportunity to fill your days with fun, and earn chances to win valuable prizes.  </p>

<p>As we get additional guidance from state officials, District 99 will update you with information regarding school and learning activities.  In the meantime, I hope that everyone continues to stay healthy. While I am physically missing everyone, know that I feel more a part of a community than ever before.</p>

<p>All my best,</p>

                        <p><strong>Confirmed COVID-19 Case</strong></p>

<p>*** TO DISTRICT 99 AND DISTRICT 58 STAFF, STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ***</p>

<p>Dear District 99 and District 58 Community:</p>

<p>District 99 and District 58 are sharing information that we have had a confirmed case of COVID-19 in our school community. </p>

<p>The affected individual is not a staff member or a student. We have been in contact with the DuPage County Health Department (DCHD), and they have identified that there is no increased risk to our students and staff, beyond the existing community spread. </p>

<p>The DCHD is reporting, as of March 23, 2020, that there are a total of 95 cases identified across DuPage County. We anticipate the numbers will continue to increase over the coming days and weeks. You can locate additional information about COVID-19 on the DCHD’s website at <a href="http://www.dupagehealth.org/COVID19" target="_blank">www.dupagehealth.org/COVID19</a>. NOTE: District 99 and District 58 will not continue to report any new cases beyond this initial report. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.dupagehealth.org/COVID19" target="_blank">DCHD’s website</a> and the <a href="http://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus" target="_blank">Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH</a>) for the most recent information. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> has provided substantial guidance on managing COVID-19; please check the CDC’s website at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">www.cdc.gov</a> and talk with your personal healthcare provider if you have questions. In summary, the CDC notes:</p>

<p>Most people who get sick with COVID-19 will have only mild illness and should recover at home. Older adults (over age 60 years) and people of any age with certain serious underlying medical conditions like lung disease, heart disease or diabetes are at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness and should seek care as soon as symptoms start.</p>

<p>Most people who have exposure to COVID-19 or have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 do not require testing for COVID-19. Right now, the IDPH is recommending testing only for individuals who require hospitalization or for people who are part of a cluster of two or more possible or confirmed cases in a residential setting, such as an assisted living facility, group home, homeless shelter or correctional setting. Depending on symptoms, exposure and testing availability, your personal healthcare provider may be able to arrange testing at a commercial lab.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider for medical advice. Stay in isolation at home until at least seven days after symptoms started AND three days after fever resolves (without any fever medications like Tylenol) AND symptoms are getting better. </p>

<p>You can locate more information about COVID-19 at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html</a></p>

<p>If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to one of us directly.</p>
