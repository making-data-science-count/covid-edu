					<h5>Are all classes being held remotely?</h5>
<p>Starting Monday, March 23, lecture-style classes traditionally held on campus will be held remotely to protect the health of the community. Remote learning employs various methods including but not limited to online courses, podcasts, and face-to-face live Internet sessions.</p>
<p>Understanding that certain classes require hands-on experiences such as clinicals and labs for degree completion, individual departments will communicate their specific instruction plans to students and faculty.</p>
<p>Professors are communicating with their students via Canvas and/or students’ Dmail accounts on how their classes will proceed. If students have not received communication from their professors by Monday, March 23, they should email them directly.</p>
<h5>Are there resources to assist with remote learning?</h5>
<p>DSU has prepared its <a href="http://bit.ly/dsu-remotelearning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Remote Learning Resources in Response to DSU’s COVID-19 Plan</a> to help students transition to remote learning. Students should refer to these resources to answer any questions they may have about connecting remotely to their classes and professors.</p>
<h5>How long will classes be held remotely?</h5>
<p>Classes will continue to be taught remotely through the end of the spring semester.</p>
<h5>How do I participate in class if I don’t have access to a computer or the Internet?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/6</strong></p>
<p>Curbside delivery of the University’s limited number of laptops is available outside of the Holland Centennial Commons, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. To check out a computer, please call 435.652.7714 to request this service.  We will need your name, D#, item information (specify laptop), and a time you would like to pick up. Internet is available on campus in our Memory Gardens as well as on the Gardner patio. If you need help securing a computer or Internet connection, please reach out to your academic advisor. If you don’t know who your advisor is, please call the Advisement Center at 435.652.7690.</p>
<h5>Will I be expected to come to campus to take my final exams?</h5>
<p>Final exams will be administered remotely. Professors will provide students with specific instructions as final exams get closer.</p>
<h5>Can I receive a pass/fail grade in lieu of a traditional letter grade?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/3</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing that the transition to remote learning as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges to some of our students, Dixie State University is offering all students the option to receive a Pass (P)/No Credit (NC) grade in lieu of a traditional letter grade for the Spring 2020 semester. This option is offered on a class-by-class basis and only applies to classes that moved to remote delivery. Please note that a grade of NC during the Spring 2020 semester means that grade will not be counted toward a student’s GPA.</p>
<p>Before choosing a P/NC grade, students should fully consider the potential impacts of this decision, such as how it will affect their GPA, financial aid and scholarship offerings, admittance into graduate programs, and other potential outcomes.  Also, traditional letter grades will still be available for all students who want it.</p>
<p>Students opting for a P/NC grade, should understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will be allowed to select P/NC during a window of time that begins on Monday, April 27, 2020, and ends on Friday, May 22, 2020</li>
<li>Students must complete the remote class to be eligible for a P/NC grade</li>
<li>All students receiving financial aid (grants and loans) and scholarships will be required to speak with a financial aid counselor prior to requesting a P/NC grade</li>
<li>Students planning to attend summer semester classes must submit their request for P/NC grading prior to May 8</li>
<li>A Pass will be issued to students whose final grade for the entire class is a C- or better</li>
<li>Earning a Pass does not count toward the GPA</li>
<li>A University form will be provided to students to request a change from traditional A-F grading to P/NC; included in the form will be a self-assessment to assist students in determining whether opting for a P/NC grade is their best choice</li>
<li>All students considering the option of P/NC are encouraged to speak with an academic advisor prior to submitting their request</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATED 3/31</strong></p>
<p>Dixie State has extended the final withdrawal date for one or all classes to Wednesday, April 22, 2020.</p>
<h5>Will I receive tuition reimbursement?</h5>
<p>All Utah System of Higher Education institutions, including Dixie State University, are not offering tuition and fee reimbursements because classes are still being taught remotely. Additionally, DSU student leaders are working on a plan to use student resources in a way that will serve the student body and meet students’ greatest needs.</p>
<h5>Is my on-campus internship impacted?</h5>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendation of the White House and CDC</a>, employees who perform nonessential duties, including student-workers and student interns, should work remotely March 21 through April 5. If the traditional responsibilities of employees are unable to be performed remotely, supervisors may assign alternative assignments that can be done remotely. If no alternative work assignments are available and employees are unable to work remotely, they should work directly with their supervisors. Students should also work with their supervisors to ensure they have worked enough hours throughout the semester to receive academic credit.</p>
<h5>Will I be able to register for summer classes?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 3/31</strong></p>
<p>Summer classes will be offered remotely and <a href="https://login.dixie.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration</a> is now open. More information about summer classes will be provided in the near future, but in the meantime, students can contact their academic advisors for assistance with scheduling.</p>
<h5>Is the Scholarship Deadline for the 2020-21 academic year extended?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 3/31</strong></p>
<p>Dixie State has extended this year’s in-state scholarship deadline to June 1. With an increase in students wanting to earn their education closer to home, missionaries returning from the field, and working adults looking to complete their degrees, it is the University’s desire to accommodate these needs for the next academic year.  Below are the details prospective students need to take advantage of this opportunity:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not yet applied to DSU, submit your application today. You will automatically be considered for scholarships upon admission. Your application must be complete by June 1.</li>
<li>If you have already been admitted to DSU and received a scholarship, congratulations, you are all set.</li>
<li>If you have submitted your DSU application but haven’t yet been admitted, complete your application today.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Are Concurrent Enrollment classes affected?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/3</strong></p>
<p>Concurrent Enrollment classes taught on the high school campuses will follow the instructional directions set forth by their school district. At this time, this means courses will be taught remotely.</p>
<p>Concurrent Enrollment classes taught on the University campus or at DSU Extension Centers will follow DSU instructional protocols for full-time students.</p>
<p>Students enrolled in Concurrent Enrollment classes will be evaluated with letter grades unless they request to change to a Pass (P)/No Credit (NC) grade. Students must choose the P/NC grade option by May 22, 2020. Additionally, Concurrent Enrollment students may drop courses until April 22, 2020; incomplete (I) grades will not be issued.</p>
<p>Questions and concerns can be directed to <a href="https://concurrent.dixie.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSU’s Concurrent Enrollment Department</a>. (Communication through e-mail is preferred.)</p>
<h5>Will Community Education classes be affected?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/15</strong></p>
<p>All in-person classes have been suspended until further notice; however, many Community Education classes are now being offered online. Visit <a href="https://ce.dixie.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ce.dixie.edu</a> for more information. Individuals enrolled in a canceled program will receive a pro-rated refund or credit to take equivalent classes in the future. Individuals registered for a class that has not yet started will receive a full refund.</p>
<h5>Will Institute for Continued Learning classes be affected?</h5>
<p>ICL classes and lecture series held on the DSU campus are canceled for the duration of the spring semester. Classes that do not take place on campus, including hiking and field trips, will still be held.</p>
<h5>Will ACE Academy or SUCCESS Academy classes be affected?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 3/26</strong></p>
<p>ACE Academy and SUCCESS Academy will follow all directives from the Utah Health Department. In conjunction with Governor Herbert and the Health Department, all public education classes have been moved to an online setting for Monday, March 16, through Friday, May 1.</p>
<p>Our campuses will be staffed and remain open during this time period while classes are being taught online. Please contact ACE Academy at 435-879-4716 or SUCCESS Academy at 435-652-7830 if you have any questions.</p>

					<h5>Will food be available on campus?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/6</strong></p>
<p>Brooks’ Stop will be open Monday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. for take-out and on-campus delivery only. Balances remaining on students’ meal plans will either be refunded or remain on the students’ accounts for the fall semester, whichever option the student prefers.</p>
<p>DSU’s Student Food Pantry will be available at Campus View Suites through the end of the spring semester. Any DSU student can use this resource by showing their Dixie ID at the Campus View Suites front desk.</p>
<h5>Is campus housing open?</h5>
<p>Yes. Because Dixie State University has a limited number of housing units and many students have asked to stay in their rooms, all housing operations will continue. Students living in campus housing will be able to stay in their rooms until the end of the semester if they choose to do so, and Housing staff will be on campus to address student needs that arise.</p>
<p>Prorated reimbursements are available to students who choose to move out between March 12 and April 7. Prorated rates are effective beginning March 24, and students can decide if they’d like their refund applied to their student account or if they want the University to hold the money and apply to future semester’s rent.</p>
<p>Residents who choose to go home for the rest of the semester should notify the Housing Office so that check-out procedures and key returns can be coordinated. Early checkouts will be treated just like end-of-the-semester checkouts and deposits will be refunded if applicable.</p>
<p>Out of caution, Housing is implementing a no-guest rule. This means that visitors are not allowed in on-campus housing facilities until further notice. This rule does not apply to family members or individuals assisting a resident during move out.</p>
<h5>Is the library open?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/7</strong></p>
<p>Effective April 8, the 2nd floor of the Holland Centennial Commons is available for computer and printer use only, Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; however, students are encouraged to study remotely if possible and only come to the library if absolutely necessary. Limited library services of curbside delivery and checkout of books and laptops also are available Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Please call 435.652.7714 or use the Chat with a Librarian feature to request this service.  We will need your name, D#, item information (title &amp; complete call # or specify laptop), and a time you would like to pick-up. For more information, please see <a href="https://library.dixie.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">library.dixie.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Level one of the Holland Centennial Commons will remain open.</p>
<p>Library and Learning Services encourages students to take advantage of the wide variety of electronic resources and services. Electronic books and journal articles are available from <a href="https://library.dixie.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">library.dixie.edu</a>.

<h5>Do my family members need tickets to attend Commencement?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/10</strong></p>

<p>Students who graduated with an associate, baccalaureate, or master’s degree in the Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Summer 2020, or Fall 2020 semesters are invited to participate in the Dec. 11 ceremony.</p>

<h5>Will I be reimbursed for my graduation fee if I can’t attend the Dec. 11 ceremony?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/10</strong></p>
<p>No. The graduation fee is being applied to costs associated with producing the Dec. 11 Commencement Ceremony, processing degrees, and printing and mailing diplomas. It is the University’s hope that with the eight months of advance notice, graduates will be able to make arrangements to come back to St. George to celebrate this monumental accomplishment with their classmates.</p>
<h5>Could the December Commencement ceremony be postponed or canceled?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/10</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Dixie State will continue to follow local, state, and national guidelines for safeguarding against COVID-19, and all future plans are dependent on the recommendations being made at that time.

<h5>Is campus housing open?</h5>
<p>Yes. Because Dixie State University has a limited number of housing units and many students have asked to stay in their rooms, all housing operations will continue. Students living in campus housing will be able to stay in their rooms until the end of the semester if they choose to do so, and Housing staff will be on campus to address student needs that arise.</p>
<p>Prorated reimbursements are available to students who choose to move out between March 12 and April 7. Prorated rates are effective beginning March 24, and students can decide if they’d like their refund applied to their student account or if they want the University to hold the money and apply to future semester’s rent.</p>
<p>Residents who choose to go home for the rest of the semester should notify the Housing Office so that check-out procedures and key returns can be coordinated. Early checkouts will be treated just like end-of-the-semester checkouts and deposits will be refunded if applicable.</p>
<p>Out of caution, Housing is implementing a no-guest rule. This means that visitors are not allowed in on-campus housing facilities until further notice. This rule does not apply to family members or individuals assisting a resident during move out.</p>
<h5>Is DSU Preschool open?</h5>
<p>No. DSU Preschool is closed until further notice.</p>
<h5>What is the University doing to protect the community?</h5>
<p>The health and success of our students, campus, and community is our top priority. To keep members of the campus community safe, lecture-style classes have been moved online; events and mass gatherings have been canceled, rescheduled or conducted remotely until further notice; and all university-sponsored travel has been canceled. All public safety services will remain open and available. More details on these decisions are available on this webpage.</p>
<p>Students and employees representing areas from all across the globe call DSU and St. George home. The University encourages the community to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/related-stigma.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not stigmatize</a> individuals of different nationalities during this stressful time.</p>

					<h5>Has University-sponsored travel been canceled?</h5>
<p>Dixie State University is canceling all University-sponsored domestic and international travel through July 31. No new travel should be booked until further notice. Employees scheduled to go on mission-critical trips must receive approval to travel from their vice president.</p>
<h5>Will travel be rescheduled?</h5>
<p>No.</p>
<h5>Will I be reimbursed for my travel?</h5>
<p>Travelers should contact the vendors they have worked with to determine what reimbursement options are available. If travelers are not eligible for refunds, they should obtain documentation and contact the DSU department involved with booking their travel to discuss details and reimbursements.</p>
<h5>Can the Booth Wellness Center clear me to travel?</h5>
<p>The Booth Wellness Center is not equipped to test for COVID-19 and consequently cannot provide travel clearance.</p>
<h5>If I or someone I have come into close contact with has recently returned from traveling, such as an LDS missionary returning home, can I come to campus?</h5>
<p>In line with the Southwest Utah Public Health Department’s recommendation, if an individual travels outside the community or has come into close contact with someone who has, that individual will be asked to monitor their health and practice social distancing for 14 days after the time of contact. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible. If the individual develops COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, or shortness of breath) during their time of social distancing, they are then asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Taking this step is part of acting as a responsible member of the community.</p>

					<h5>Is campus closed to staff and faculty?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/15</strong></p>
<p>All DSU faculty, staff, and student employees should conduct their work remotely, if possible. Please work with your supervisor to make appropriate arrangements. Working remotely is scheduled to take place March 21 through April 29. (The date is slightly different than the current May 1, 2020 end date of Governor Herbert’s Stay Safe Stay Home Directive to accommodate DSU’s already-established part-time pay schedule.) At the end of this time period, the University’s coronavirus working task force will reassess the situation and determine if employees need to work remotely for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>If employees’ work must be completed on campus, they should communicate with their supervisors to determine if the minimum number of personnel needed to operate and maintain can serve on a rotating basis to fulfill departments’ responsibilities. If business must be conducted in person, no more than 10 individuals should meet at a time and individuals should keep six feet in between themselves and others, in line with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC recommendations</a>.</p>

<h5>What options do I have for alternative work for March 21 – April 20?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/13</strong></p>
<p>Faculty have migrated most courses to an online format, primarily utilizing Canvas. Faculty resources and training can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_A769kglR1BczpyWyqPf1YTiBw07FOq16QmXpDblvPo/edit#heading=h.shcqxexrkhb9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. For staff employees, please work with your supervisor on what current work assignments you can complete remotely, utilizing the above resources.</p>
<p>If your staff work assignments cannot be completed 100% remotely between March 21 – April 20, staff employees can work with their supervisor on alternative work assignments. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Facilities Management</strong> <strong>employees</strong> moving from indoor assignments (Custodial, etc.) to outdoor assignments (Grounds, etc.), working independently or in small groups working 6 feet apart.</li>
<li>
<strong>Office employees</strong> creating or updating work manuals (“how to do my job duties”) for their position(s), reviewing and updating policies and procedures for their department, digital file and email organization / clean-up, completing trainings on Zoom or above resources to better utilize them to complete other work assignments remotely, department webpage / content updates, etc.</li>
<li>If the above examples are not available AND/OR employee remains available to work (e.g. has not voluntarily quit, moved from the area and unable to accept campus work, etc.):
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full-Time Staff</span>: Can utilize accrued vacation, contract, or compensatory leave during this period. Sick leave may also be used (with supervisor approval) to care for self or family members impacted by illness, medical quarantine, etc. <em>During this period, sick leave can also be used for self-quarantine, the closure of a child’s school or childcare, and for those employees that are  </em><em>high risk (e.g. over age 60 and/or are immunocompromised).</em> The HR Director is available to assist employees if they have limited leave available, on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part-Time Staff</span>: After remote work and/or alternative work assignments have been exhausted and a part-time employee is still short of “normal” hours, supervisors can opt to pay their part-time employees up to their normally scheduled hours or up the same hours paid to the part-time employee for the February 21 – March 5 pay period (whichever is less). Such time must be input by the supervisor into NOVAtime for the March 21 – April 5 and the April 6 – April 20 pay periods only, with comments added to show what additional hours were added, and that it was due to Covid-19.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>What options do I have for alternative work after April 20?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/13</strong></p>
<p>Faculty (both full-time and part-time) will continue to teach their courses online through the rest of spring semester. Those scheduled to teach during the summer semester will also be teaching online.</p>
<p>For staff employees, please continue work with your supervisor on what current work assignments you can complete remotely through the remainder of April (while the state continues to be under a stay-at-home<br>
order), utilizing the above resources.</p>
<p>If your staff work assignments cannot be completed 100% remotely after April 20, staff employees can work with their supervisor on alternative work assignments for the rest of April. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Facilities Management employees</strong> moving from indoor assignments (Custodial, etc.) to outdoor assignments (Grounds, etc.), working independently or in small groups working 6 feet apart.</li>
<li>
<strong>Office employees</strong> creating or updating work manuals (“how to do my job duties”) for their position(s), reviewing and updating policies and procedures for their department, digital file and email organization / clean-up, completing trainings on Zoom or above resources to better utilize them to complete other work assignments remotely, department webpage / content updates, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the above examples are not available AND/OR employees remain available to work (e.g. have not voluntarily quit, moved from the area and unable to accept campus work, etc.):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full-Time Staff</span>: Can utilize accrued vacation, contract, or compensatory leave through the end of April. Sick leave may also be used (with supervisor approval) to care for self or family members impacted by illness, medical quarantine, etc. <em>During this period, sick leave can also be used for self-quarantine, the closure of a child’s school or childcare, and for those employees that are high risk (e.g. over age 60 and/or are immunocompromised).</em> The HR Director is available to assist employees if they have limited leave available, on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part-Time Staff</span>: After remote work and/or alternative work assignments have been exhausted and a part-time employee is still short of “normal” hours, supervisors can opt to pay their part-time employees up to a week’s worth of normally scheduled hours, or half of their time worked February 21 – March 5 pay period (whichever is less). Such time must be input by the supervisor into NOVAtime between April 21 – 29, with comments added to show what additional hours were added, and that it was due to<br>
Covid-19. These hours will be paid to the employee on May 15.
<ul>
<li>Part-time staff (including student and work-study positions), where such positions would have normally ended at the conclusion of Spring Semester, will only be paid through April 29, which is considered the “end of term” for Spring Semester 2020. Supervisors are asked to terminate these positions using the EPAF system by the end of April. Such employees are eligible for rehire in August 2020 when the Fall Semester begins; supervisors will complete a rehire EPAF to restart their jobs in the system.</li>
<li>Departments who have part-time staff planned to work for the summer (starting May 4), but who may be unable to do so until given clearance to resume working on location: please reach out to the HR Director for options, which will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Will employees continue to be paid?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 4/13</strong></p>
<p>Employees will continue to work, remotely for most employees and on-campus for those providing mission-critical services, so they will continue to be paid for March 21 – April 30. If full-time employees are unable to work remotely and their supervisors are unable to create alternative work assignments for them, these employees may use leave accruals to continue their full pay through the end of April. Part-time employees in this situation can also receive pay (with supervisor approval) from March 21 through April 29, or the end of spring term (payable April 15, April 30, and May 15), up to a certain number of hours per pay period. See <a href="https://wellness.dixie.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/04/Staff-Resources-for-Working-Remotely-2020-04-13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staff resources</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The University’s Covid-19 Taskforce is continuing to meet frequently and assess the situation as we receive additional information and guidance. We will continue to monitor the above and reassess closer to April 30, and make updates to this page at that time.</p>

					<h5>What can I do to protect myself and others from the virus?</h5>
<p>There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19, so the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus by protecting yourself the same way you would from other viruses. Follow these guidelines to protect yourself and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time, especially after you have been in a public place, blown your nose, coughed, or sneezed. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth as much as possible.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue. If no tissue is immediately available, cough or sneeze into your elbow.</li>
<li>Practice social distancing, that is maintaining 6 feet of distance between yourself and other people.</li>
<li>Boost your immune function by prioritizing sleep, eating a nutrient-rich diet, specifically Vitamins C, D, and Zinc, and managing stress.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect shared surfaces.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care.</li>
</ul>
<h5>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h5>
<p><strong>UPDATED 3/31</strong></p>
<p>Symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses like the cold or flu. Symptoms may include cough, fever, and shortness of breath. The CDC believes at this time that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure. This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MERS-CoV</a> viruses.</p>
<p>The White House Coronavirus Task Force and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, partnered with Apple to create a free <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/covid19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> that guide individuals through a series of questions to determine if they should seek care for COVID-19 symptoms. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0327-statement-covid-19-apple-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tool</a> provides CDC recommendations on next steps including guidance on social distancing and self-isolating, how to closely monitor symptoms, recommendations on testing, and when to contact a medical provider.</p>
<h5>What do I do if I am experiencing symptoms of COVID-19?</h5>
<p><em><strong>UPDATED 3/31</strong><br></em></p>
<p>As there is now evidence of community transmission of COVID-19 in Utah, individuals who have a mild cough, fever, or shortness of breath should stay home (except to get medical care) and self-monitor their symptoms according to directions outlined on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC’s website</a>.​ This will help reduce the spread of the virus. If you have COVID-19 symptoms and have been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, a suspected case of COVID-19 or have traveled to an impacted area, please contact The Booth Wellness Center or the Utah Coronavirus Information Line. The Booth Wellness Center is not equipped to test for COVID-19, but staff are available to answer questions regarding testing. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to help keep the center’s healthcare professionals and other patients healthy, the Booth Wellness Center is open for Telehealth medical and mental health appointments only via Zoom or by phone. Please call their office to schedule an appointment.</p>
