<h2><span style="color: #000000;">April 14, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now that the state has closed school facilities for the remainder of the year, we have a few pieces of information to share with families.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><u>Weather Make-Up Day</u> – We will be making use of our last weather make-up day on Friday, May 22 as another virtual instruction day.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><u>Last Day of the School Year</u> – The last day of school for students in grades K-11 will be Friday, June 5. Information on the end of the year for seniors will depend upon the graduation adjustments that have yet to be determined. Traditional events to celebrate the transition of students to the next grade level will be organized at the building level and communicated with you directly from your principal.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><u>Graduation and Senior Awards Night</u> – We are currently investigating alternate options to the format of how to accomplish these two important events. The District is proud of the many accomplishments of our current seniors and is committed to offering them a graduation ceremony that honors them. Any events that honor seniors will comply with state regulations – current or new – that may be in place at the time of the events. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><u>Food Service Accounts</u> – Any funds remaining in food service accounts will be transferred and available next school year. Families with graduating seniors or who would like the money refunded should contact Marti Rhoads at <a style="color: #000000;" href="mailto:M_Rhoads@easdpa.org">M_Rhoads@easdpa.org</a> or 717-721-1400, extension 11302 to either request a refund, transfer funds to a sibling, or donate to the food service department.  If you are requesting a refund, please provide the name of the student, name to whom check should be written, and address where the check should be mailed.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><u>Personal Belongings at School</u> – We are asking that families wait until the stay-at-home order has been lifted in order to gather non-essential belongings from the school. The process for retrieving belongings essential for learning from the school remains in place. Student who have essential belongings like musical instruments, calculators, necessary textbooks, etc. can call the school office and leave a message about scheduling a time to gather them.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><u>Tracking Student Completion of Work</u> – As described in the email to families last Thursday, this week marks a shift in our online learning program. This week there is an expectation that all students be engaged in the instructional activities provided by their teachers and complete the work assigned. Teachers will be keeping track of the work that is assigned and completed by each student. If you have questions about how this new phase in our online program works in your child’s classroom, please let us know.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you again for supporting the participation and success of your child in our EASD online learning program. Our next parent/guardian survey will be coming out at the end of this week to gather more information from you about how things are going.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">April 9, 2020</span></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Virtual-Spirit-Week.pdf">Virtual Spirit Week</a></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you for your ongoing and outstanding support of the District initiative to provide online learning activities for our students. As we have seen, our situation is everchanging and we continue to get additional information and guidance from the state. Moments ago, we received official word from the Pennsylvania Department of Education that <strong><u>all schools in the Commonwealth are closed for the remainder of the school year.</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Based initially on our growing understanding of how to teach in an online environment and now in reaction to this new development, we will be making some changes to improve our online educational plan. Beginning on Tuesday, April 14, we will be awarding credit for completed work and learning activities. As we prepare to launch into this new phase, we want to provide you with some information on how this process will work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>GRADES 5 – 12</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Teachers will evaluate if work is completed or not. To determine if work is completed, teachers will apply the following question:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Did the student put forth an honest effort in the substantial completion of the assignment? </em></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If the answer is “YES,” then the student should receive credit for completing that assignment.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">If the answer is “NO,” then the student will not receive credit for completing the assignment, and feedback will be provided to the student regarding why credit was not awarded. *</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">* Students will be able to complete assignments that were not submitted or were marked incomplete up until a week after the assigned due date of the assignment to receive credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Teachers will keep track of the completion status of all assignments for the rest of the 4<sup>th</sup> marking period. At the end of the marking period, teachers will calculate the number of completed assignments out of the total number of assignments to calculate an average that will serve as the grade for the 4<sup>th</sup> marking period. Final grades for year-long courses will be identified by calculating the average of all four marking periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Essentially, students who complete all of the assigned work starting April 14 through the remainder of the school year will earn a 100 percent that will be calculated with their first three marking period percentages to receive final grades for the school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>KINDERGARTEN – GRADE 4</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Since grade point averages and calculations at these levels are not as critical, students at these levels will continue to receive feedback on their completed work. Parents/Guardians of students who are not completing their work will be contacted to offer support and identify why work is not being completed. As long as the student was on pace at the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> marking period to progress to the next grade-level, he/she will continue on that path.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>ALL STUDENTS</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If any parent/guardian believes his/her child has extenuating circumstances that make it unreasonable for the child to complete online learning each day, the parent should reach out to the building principal to discuss the conditions for opting out of the online learning program. In general, situations where an opt-out request by a parent/guardian will be honored will be one of the following situations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A family is still working on internet connectivity issues at home or does not have transportation to make it to one of the <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WiFi-Message.pdf">FREE WIFI ZONES</a> at any of our school buildings.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A student is being asked to work in an essential industry and is being required to work full-time hours.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A student is being asked to care for multiple younger siblings throughout the day while parent(s) are working in an essential industry.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Students receiving specialized instructional programming will be receiving individualized communication regarding their plan and expectations for participation in the online program.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We want to be flexible in any situation where asking a student to engage in our online learning program is too much, so please reach out to building administration to help us accommodate those needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, we have gathered a significant amount of feedback through our parent/guardian survey that has helped us see what is working and has helped us identify ways to increase participation. (An updated Frequently Asked Questions [FAQ] document in response to that survey has been posted <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FAQ-4.8.20.pdf">HERE</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you for the many ways you are continuing to support students throughout this closure!</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">April 1, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are midway through the first week of online learning at EASD, and we would like to thank those who have been participating in the various activities, assignments, and challenges being shared each day by our teachers! If you have not had a chance to get into a routine yet, we encourage you to develop a schedule that can work within your household to start ASAP.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we look ahead to next week and beyond, we have the following updates to share:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">We will be making use of the built-in weather make-up days on Wednesday, April 8 and Thursday, April 9 as two virtual learning days. Students will still have off from virtual learning as scheduled on Friday, April 10 and Monday, April 13.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">We have established work-time guidelines for how long it should take students to complete online learning activities. <strong>The maximum amount of time spent daily for students in grades</strong> <strong>K-6 is about two hours</strong> <strong>and for</strong> <strong>grades 7-12 is about three hours</strong>. As we are all new at teaching and learning in the virtual environment, it may take us another week or so to calibrate to these target times; so, please be patient.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Information about when teachers will hold “virtual office hours” will be shared next week to help support the ongoing communication between school and home. During this time, teachers can hold virtual meetings with students, be available for phone calls and questions from parents/guardians and students, or simply be readily available for supporting student learning on an as-needed basis.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We value your partnership and ongoing communication as we respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and school closure. To further that communication, you will receive an invitation this Friday to complete a weekly parent/guardian survey to share your feedback on how online learning is going and suggest ways we can make our programs more effective. Please watch for that email and survey link.</span></p>
<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Continuity-of-Education-Plan-4.1.20.pdf">Pennsylvania Department of Education Continuation of Education Plan</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">March 30, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Governor Wolf recently announced the closure of PA schools for an undetermined amount of time and extended the stay at home order for Lancaster County through the end of April.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout the school closure, the District remains committed to offering online learning to keep students engaged in their education. Today, we completed day one of online learning and are hopeful your son or daughter was able to access instructional components, resources, and communicated with his or her teacher. Thank you for your patience during any technical glitches that you or your child may have experienced as we are aware of issues today with both Schoology and SeeSaw. Remember, this is our first day of online instruction as well, so please make sure that communication continues between you, your child, and his/her teacher.  Please contact your child’s school if you’re having difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Also, regarding online learning, our programs offered online to all students are optional but highly important. Progress along the curriculum depends on your support of your child’s participation in these online educational activities. Material this week should be review to allow students and teachers to get used to the online learning environment. While activities completed online at this point will not be graded, feedback will be provided on completed assignments and activities. Depending on how well this week goes, we may be moving into new content starting as early as next week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Communication during this closure is an important ingredient to success in any learning environment, and a virtual one is no different. Please reach out to your teacher, guidance counselor, or school principal if more or a different mode of communication is needed. Communication can be accomplished via phone, e-mail, or video conference if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We recognize that there are situations that make it difficult for students and parents to access educational resources and communicate with the school using the online tools. We are working on some potential solutions to these situations within each building and will be in touch later this week with additional information. If you have immediate questions regarding access to resources or specific situations making it difficult to engage in the online learning activities, please contact your building principal for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, balancing student work time online with other healthy activities during this closure is important as well. We suggest structuring the day in a way that fits your home situation and includes time away from screens participating in some sort of physical activity. As always please let us know if we can support you in any way.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">March 25, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>(Updated at 5:00 PM to reflect optional status of the COE program.)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Since the extended statewide school closure, the Pennsylvania Department of Education has provided guidelines for districts to introduce more organized online learning opportunities.  Ephrata Area School District will begin online learning on Monday, March 30 for all students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout this school year, our teachers have been using SeeSaw (K-4) and Schoology (Grades 5-12) as classroom tools to improve communication related to classroom activities among students, parents, and teachers.  Since the closure, teachers have been using these same tools to reach out and connect with students to see how everyone was coping with the closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout this week, teachers are getting support through online training and time to prepare instructional activities and design lessons to be delivered online for all students. Like many of the practices, we are all being asked to adjust in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Teaching in an online environment is a new territory for our teachers. While our entire district is working hard to prepare for next week, we will ask for your patience and flexibility as we try our best to provide valuable educational experiences through the remainder of this closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we progress, it is important that you support your son/daughter to participate in the coursework being offered in this virtual learning environment. It is important to note that these activities are <strong>OPTIONAL </strong>for students and part of the District Continuation of Education (COE) program required of all school districts in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We recognize that learning in an online environment is also new for our students. Accordingly, we are spending the first week of our COE program focusing on content that has already been taught during this school year. Activities for week one will be review, enrichment, or extension assignments on familiar content so that students can get adjusted to the format in which assignments are presented. Communication during week one will be ongoing between students, parents, and teachers through the online learning tools, and more formally through a district-wide survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We have received questions regarding graduation, grade progression, and how the calendar may be adjusted if the closure is extended. While we are certainly considering all potential future realities so that we can adjust accordingly, we believe it is premature to make any definitive plans on many of these items as our situation continues to change by the day. We can say that our intention is to provide instruction on the key competencies through our COE program to provide all students who participate the ability to progress to the next year, course, or graduation (for seniors) that they would have under normal circumstances. Additionally, we do believe that the success of our COE program will be a key factor in how early we will be able to end the school year for students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, with the state-directed school closure currently scheduled to end just before the holiday break, we presently intend for students to return to school on Tuesday, April 14.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">March 24, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Kindergarten Parents/Guardians:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Since Governor Wolf’s announcement yesterday to extend the school closure longer than originally anticipated, Ephrata Area School District is looking for more ways to expand online learning opportunities for our students.  Because of device availability, iPads were not initially sent home with kindergarteners.  In the coming weeks, your child’s kindergarten teacher may be posting enrichment activities that require online access.  If your family is in need of a device to help your kindergartener access this content, we may be able to help.  Please contact your child’s school by Thursday, March 26, leave a message with your child’s name, your need for a device, and contact information.  If you have other questions, please reach out to your child’s principal.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">March 23, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This afternoon, Governor Wolf announced all schools in the Commonwealth will remain closed for students through at least Wednesday, April 8, as a result of the COVID-19 response efforts. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, “The closure order could be extended beyond April 8 if necessary to save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, it was announced today all standardized testing for students in career and technical education (CTE) programs have been cancelled. These include exams from the National Occupational Competency Testing Institute (NOCTI) and National Institute of Metalworking Skills (NIMS).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">All Ephrata Area School District offices will remain closed, and access to buildings will continue to be by appointment only. Parents and students should leave a voicemail, preferably a day in advance, with the reason they need to access the building and a time window that they are available. They will be contacted within 24 hours to arrange details.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you for taking advantage of the <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/educational-resources-during-school-closure/">ONLINE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES</a> we have posted on our website and interacting with teachers through a variety of online platforms. We intend to continue and grow these efforts. Keep watch for an emailed survey to obtain feedback on the ways we can make improvements and work together to keep young minds working.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ephrata Area School District will also continue to provide free weekday breakfasts and lunches for all children ages 18 and under several times per week. The next meal distributions will be from 10:00 AM – 1:00 PM at Ephrata High School, Clay and Fulton Elementary Schools on Wednesday, March 25; Friday, March 27; Tuesday, March 31; Thursday, April 2; and Tuesday, April 7. <strong><u>Please note the updated timeframe of 10:00 AM – 1:00 PM</u></strong> and be reminded that children must be present at the time of meal pick-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you could you use a hand with getting your child(ren) to a meal pick-up or have additional needs, a growing list of community organizations have offered to help District families. <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/volunteer-resources-during-covid-19-school-closure/">CLICK HERE</a> and please do not hesitate to contact any of the organizations listed to obtain assistance.  If you are interested in volunteering your time, please contact these organizations directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you for your understanding and patience as we navigate these unchartered waters together. Despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is extremely rewarding to observe and experience the ways our community continues to support each other during these challenging times.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">March 20, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we reach the end of the first week of the COVID-19 school closure, we continue to see enriching learning activities happening in every building and at every level this week. We have some outstanding and innovative teachers coming up with solutions to challenges and creative ways to use the technology and resources in the home to stay connected and keep minds working! This is new territory for all of us, and I could not be prouder of the great work by our EASD staff and students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are continually updating the District website with educational resources and wanted to draw your attention to this latest one from <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://education-reimagined.org/distance-learning-resource-center/">Education Reimagined</a> as it includes quality resources for students, teachers, parents, communities, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, we have posted information on a new program available to help families who need high speed Internet access.  <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blue-Ridge-Learn-From-Home-Initiative.pdf">CLICK HERE</a> to learn more about the Blue Ridge Communications <em>Learning From Home Initiative.  </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Yesterday, the Pennsylvania Department of Education shared that students will not be required to take PSSA and Keystone tests this year. At EASD, we are thankful for this relief and recognize that the scores from these tests do not reflect all of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that we value most.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, the next “grab-and-go” meals will be distributed on Monday, March 23 and Wednesday, March 25 from 10:00 AM – 2:00 PM at Ephrata High School, Fulton and Clay Elementary Schools.  Please be reminded, children MUST be present to receive meals.  In order ensure proper food preparation, please take a moment to complete <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpcTzDozKwjqmqMNgQMCwfWIDf767sUv3OS0Iux-_Q6w7fLA/viewform">this short questionnaire</a>, if you plan to pick up a meal.  If you need assistance traveling to these meal distributions, please contact <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/volunteer-resources-during-covid-19-school-closure/">any of these organizations</a> who have offered to lend a hand during the school closure.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we continue to work within the state and federal guidelines on how to support students and families during these challenging times, we want to draw your attention to a few activities that have or will soon be happening:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">District teachers are being encouraged to connect with their students on a weekly basis. This is not to assign work or provide instruction, but to check in to see how students are doing and to offer optional educational activities and resources to keep minds working while we are not in session.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Meals are being provided to any child age 18 and under, regardless of free/reduced meal or school enrollment status. You can access more information <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/131954-2/">HERE</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A list of free educational resources is available <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/educational-resources-during-school-closure/">HERE</a> via our District website in case you are looking for something educational to occupy your son’s/daughter’s time while they are home.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">We are maintaining a list of the communications and resources related to the coronavirus <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/easd-communication-resources/">HERE</a> on our District homepage.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">And finally, we have been contacted by several organizations and individuals interested in volunteering to support students and families. We are connecting and collecting these growing resources <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/volunteer-resources-during-covid-19-school-closure/">HERE</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Like you, we continue to monitor the latest coronavirus developments and try to do what we can to minimize the impact to our students.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">March 16, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you for your ongoing patience and understanding during this unprecedented and rapidly evolving public health crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Please continue to visit the District website and social media outlets where all information is being updated on a regular basis. Today, we have the following items to announce:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Free meal distribution will take place for all children ages 18 and under on Tuesday, March 17 and Thursday, March 19.

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">At this time, we are not asking teachers to develop or facilitate any online lessons for a variety of reasons. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has made it clear that if we provide any online instruction, we are obligated to fulfill the requirement of all of our specialized instructional programs.  We do not believe an educational program offered completely online can meet all of that criteria for every student. Therefore, the Ephrata Area School District is not permitted to send out assignments or projects for students to work on during this shutdown. Our staff may be able to offer resources or optional experiences to help engage students and families while school is closed. Look for this in future communications.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the days that follow, we ask that you continue to use social distancing and common-sense strategies to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. You may be interested in <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">this news article</a> that does a great job of explaining how outbreaks “spread exponentially” and what we can do to “flatten the curve.”</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">As previously communicated, the COVID-19 situation is rapidly changing.  Moments ago, Governor Wolf closed all Pennsylvania schools for ten days.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>District Parents/Guardians of Students in Kindergarten through Grade 4:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The safety and security of our students and staff remain our number one priority. For that reason, the District will be closed for students from Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 20. The Administration will evaluate the situation on a week-by-week basis, and further details will be communicated as information becomes available.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Centers for Disease Control recommends social distancing, and Governor Tom Wolf recommends avoiding situations where large numbers are gathered. We believe that being compliant with these recommendations means closing District schools for students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Today, students were directed to take home materials from the classroom that would allow them to work at home if that becomes necessary. These are important classroom materials, and it will be critical that these materials come back to school when regular schedules resume.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For students in Grades 1-4, the District is sending home an iPad, case, and charger with charging brick. This will be able to be used as an educational resource during this time. For many of the resources on the iPad, internet access is required, while other applications will run without internet access.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As the situation is evolving by the hour, please stay tuned for further communication and additional information about how these resources can be used at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As always, thank you for your ongoing support and understanding as we work together to keep our schools safe for all who enter.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>March 13, 2020</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As the global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve quickly, please be assured Ephrata Area School District administrators are continuing to monitor the spread of the virus and how it could impact our school community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Please know there have been no cases of COVID-19 reported in our school district.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As outlined in our communication on February 28, District leaders are taking this responsibility very seriously and continue to review recommendations from global, federal, and local health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), Pennsylvania Department of Health, and Pennsylvania Department of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Discussions took place and information was provided to District staff during the Professional Learning half-day on Wednesday, March 11 to ensure we are all moving forward responsibly, implementing prevention strategies, and taking steps to mitigate concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">More specifically, critical considerations and practical checklists, as listed below, are taking place on a daily basis to keep our school learning and social environments safe for students, staff, and community members.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Building cleaning procedures have been increased, including more frequent cleanings of desktops, door knobs, Activeboards, stair rails, technology devices, writing utensils, and more.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Staff Districtwide are encouraging students to wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, cover their mouth and nose with their elbow or a tissue when they sneeze or cough, and not to share food.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Field trips are being closely monitored. Please know parents and students are free to choose whether or not to participate in any scheduled field trips.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Events involving the attendance of large groups of individuals are being assessed, should potential cancellations or postponing of events be necessary.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">We ask that you please understand cancellation decisions may be made on short notice, dependent upon on the destination of the field trip and the specifics of each event. Know that each decision will be made with great care after gathering relevant information.  Your flexibility and understanding is appreciated.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">District administrators are reviewing “social distancing” recommendations and considering ways to leverage technology for potential learning opportunities outside of school – should a need arise – similar to what some colleges and universities have implemented.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You can find up to date information regarding COVID-19 on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the PA Department of Health, and the PA Department of Education websites. These links and all District COVID-19 communication have been added to our website HERE.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As always, the safety and security of our students and staff remain our number one priority.  Thank you for your ongoing support and understanding, as we work together to keep our schools safe for all who enter.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">February 28, 2020</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As the safety and security of our students is always our top priority, please know we are closely monitoring the occurrences of the coronavirus in the United States and doing what we can within our school facilities to ensure we continue to maintain a healthy environment for all students and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><u><strong>What is coronavirus disease? </strong> </u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. It is a new virus first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ephrata Area School District administrators are regularly reviewing recommendations and the latest updates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the Pennsylvania Department of Health, in conjunction with communications among leading national school organizations, including the American Association for School Administrators (AASA) and the National School Board Association (NSBA). These efforts help District leaders monitor the spread of the disease and utilize resources to assist with prevention.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to the CDC, symptoms of the coronavirus are respiratory related and may also include symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Please contact your health care provider if you have recently traveled to China or if you are concerned about specific symptoms you or your child are experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At school, we are encouraging students to wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds and to cover their mouth and nose with their elbow or a tissue when they sneeze or cough. The District offers guidelines available <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://easdpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Is-your-child-too-sick-for-school-C.docx">HERE</a> that answer the question, “Is my child too sick for school?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The American Association of School Administrators (AASA) encourage us to follow common-sense strategies for preventing the spread of communicable diseases:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Maintain your distance from others when ill.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Keep children home who exhibit cold and flu-like symptoms.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Refrain from going to work if you have cold and flu-like symptoms.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Keep unwashed hands out of your mouth, eyes, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Use anti-bacterial soap.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Do not share food.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Maintain a clean environment by using anti-bacterial products daily on all high-touch surfaces.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, you may find helpful the following resources that provide more detailed information on the coronavirus:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ephrata Area School District will follow recommendations and work closely with federal, state, and local organizations and resources in the event there would be local coronavirus outbreak. However, it is our hope that will never be the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We will continue to focus on prevention in our schools to ensure a safe and secure learning environment for all students and staff. Please do not hesitate to contact your building principal or school nurse with any questions.</span></p>
