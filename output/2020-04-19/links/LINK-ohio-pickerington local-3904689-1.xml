<p>Beginning Tuesday, March 17, students were provided with Blizzard Bag/online learning assignments to complete at home during the duration of the closure.</p>

                        <p>During the closure due to the coronavirus, district students are expected to complete Blizzard Bag/online learning assignments at home. Teachers will continue to add assignments each week so that the number of assignments will keep up with the number of days schools are closed.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>General information for all grades is provided below, followed by a separate section with Blizzard Bag/online learning homework assignments for each grade.</p>
<p><strong>Preschool through 4th Grade Instructional Plan</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Blizzard Bags are in a choice board format. In each choice board, you will find daily expectations, must-dos for the week and can dos for the week. The minimum expectation for each Preschool through 4th grade student is to complete the daily expectations and the must-dos for the week. We would recommend that students also complete some or all of the can-dos. We understand that some of the can-dos require the use of technology and that some families may not have a device or WIFI available to them, so we will understand if some students cannot complete online assignments at the Preschool through 4th grade levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions about your student’s work, the Blizzard Bags, or any of the assignments, we are asking that you first email your student’s classroom teacher. Here is a link to the </span><a href="https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLSD staff directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to locate teacher email addresses. </span></p>
<p><strong>Grades 5-8 Instructional Plan</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since all students in grades 5-8 have PLSD One-to-One device, we will be utilizing </span><a href="http://classroom.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Classroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all classwork. Each week, teachers on each team will release choice boards of all assignments for the week. These assignments cover Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies and elective classes. The choice board is a way for students and parents to see all of the work for the week in one place. Also, this allows for the teams of teachers to plan together and create meaningful work while students are at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, to the curriculum assignments, students in grades 5-8 must complete the check-in daily which is located on the top of the choice boards. This check-in serves as a way for teachers to connect with students daily in order to continue their strong teacher-student relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If families do not have access to WIFI at home, PLSD does have the Every-1 connected program in which we loan out hotspots. We have a limited number of hotspots remaining.

<p><strong>Grades 9-12 Instructional Plan</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since all students in grades 9-12 have PLSD One-to-One devices, we will be utilizing </span><a href="http://classroom.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Classroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all classwork. Teachers will release all work for each subject on different days throughout the week. Students will have a week to complete the assignments for each subject:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mondays – Math content for the week will be released</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesdays – Science and Technical subjects content for the week will be released</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesdays – ELA content for the week will be released</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursdays – Social Studies content for the week will be released</span></li>

</ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we will be creating optional enrichment opportunities for all students, including opportunities for the Ohio State’s Tests Prep (formerly called AIR testing). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We will only be replacing completely non-functional Chromebooks at this time. That means we will only swap out Chromebooks for loaners if the original Chromebook will completely not work. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Every-1 Connected Program (Hotspots)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pickerington Schools is now offering a limited number of free wireless hotspot devices to students who have limited or no internet access at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every-1-Connected is a program sponsored by Pickerington Schools. It gives students with the greatest need the opportunity to borrow a free hotspot from the District Office. Hotspot forms and pickups can be done <em><strong>only</strong></em> during the times listed above at the PLSD District Office (90 N. East Street, Pickerington, Ohio, 43147)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile hotspots allow free access to the internet. The devices are helpful when students know they will be working on a big assignment over a weekend or for a few days when Wi-Fi is required for completion. Multiple students can sign on to a single hotspot, so students are asked to coordinate use for group projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the device and monthly service fees are fully paid by the district and through a grant. The program is intended to help district students access online resources at home to help bridge the digital divide and ensure educational equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure peace of mind for parents, these devices use internet content filtering and browsing history is recorded. Only one device may be borrowed per household, but these devices can be signed out repeatedly throughout the year, based on availability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For students to participate in this program, </span><a href="https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Every-1-Connected-Progam-Application.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents must complete this Hotspot application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By signing this form, the parent agrees to assume all responsibility for equipment checked out to the student. A replacement fee of $150 will be charged if the device is lost, damaged or not returned. The existing district Technology Protection Plan can cover the cost of any damaged hotspot devices, but damage(s) due to intentional reckless, willful, wanton and/or malicious conduct is not covered.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Steps for Obtaining a Hotspot</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Every-1-Connected-Progam-Application.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete the Hotspot application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and return it to your child’s media center.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications will be approved by district Technology staff at the District Office.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students bring the device home and connect to their device.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All devices must be returned before the end of the school year.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Who is eligible to participate</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program is open to Pickerington School students who are fully enrolled in one of the 15 district buildings. Priority will be given to students on the free/reduced lunch list and who have little to no household internet access. The district reserves the right to loan devices to any student who shows a need.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Is there a cost?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowing a hotspot is free. There are no fees for the device or the service. If the device is lost, stolen, or damaged, a $150 fee will be charged to parents. The district Technology Protection Plan can cover any possible damages, but it will not cover the cost if the device is lost or stolen and will not cover damage(s) due to intentional reckless, willful, wanton and/or malicious conduct.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rules of use</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hotspots are provided and maintained by Pickerington Schools. If problems occur while using the hotspot, contact the school’s media center for technical support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The borrower is responsible for ensuring the hotspot is not damaged, lost, or stolen. The replacement cost for the hotspot is $150. The school media center specialist/aide should be notified immediately of any damaged, lost, or stolen hotspot.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hotspots are provided for educational use. Users must adhere to the rules listed here, as well as those included in the district Acceptable Use Policy and the district Student Handbook.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hotspots must be returned to Pickerington Schools at the end of the renewal period, upon the request of district administration, or upon withdrawal from the district.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hotspots are for use by students enrolled in Pickerington Schools only and should only be used on school-issued devices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bypassing the internet filter, resetting the hotspot, or reconfiguring the hotspot is strictly prohibited and cause for immediate removal from the district’s Every-1-Connected program. This behavior also will be subject to possible school discipline.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Printing of Blizzard Bags (K-4) or Other Needed Work</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the General Manager of Staples – Just wanted to offer support for any students who do not have access to a printer at home, they can stop in their local Staples in Reynoldsburg to print any hard copy assignments they may need during the school/library closures. My team is working on setting up a station to access google classrooms to allow students to print off their work in the coming weeks. We hope to take some burden off our teachers and administrators during this time in any way we can. As a parent who has students in the district, I know this is a trying time for all of us. We are here to help. There will be no charge for this service.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">WIFI Assistance for Families without WIFI at Their Home</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help ease this transition and make it possible for <em><strong>all</strong></em> students to have access to WiFi, Spectrum and Comcast are now offering internet services for free or at a discounted rate for 60 days to any K-12 or College student. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><a href="https://forward-edge.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3391e12317754916b7a5d95cf&amp;id=92b62fa056&amp;e=fda8e03c6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charter-Spectrum’s Free WiFi Deal</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charter-Spectrum is offering free access to broadband and WiFi services to households with students who do not already have the services. The WiFi access will be available for 60 days to households with students from kindergarten to college who do not already have a Spectrum broadband subscription at any service level up to 100 Mbps. To enroll in the service you can call 1-844-488-8395 or click the link above to learn more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><a href="https://forward-edge.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3391e12317754916b7a5d95cf&amp;id=a0e3d6bb48&amp;e=fda8e03c6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comcast “Internet Essentials” Program</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comcast says applicants who qualify will get a 25 Mbps connection for free for two months. All new customers in this program will receive a free self-install kit that includes a cable modem and WiFi router. There is no term contract. Click the link above to learn more. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">PLSD Has a Digital Library for all Students</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pickerington Schools use Overdrive/Sora to extend our media centers to the digital world.  Since our schools and most public libraries are closed, we encourage our students to access the PLSD Overdrive/Sora through their Classlink page to check digital books and audiobooks. We are currently working with our media center staff to add more books to our digital library. This is available for all students grade K-12.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Hints for Getting on Classlink</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://launchpad.classlink.com/pickerington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here to sign into Classlink</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students will need to log in with their PLSD Google Account, make sure no one else is logged into Google on that browser. If you get a red Not-Connected error message that is probably the issue.  Remember students login is their PLSD email address which is firstname_lastname lastthreedigitsofID#@students.plsd.us (example: john_smith123@students.plsd.us) and their password is their student ID# + 00</span></p>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>These Blizzard Bags are in a choice board format. In each choice board, you will find daily expectations, must-dos for the week and can dos for the week. The minimum expectation for each  student is to complete the daily expectations and the must-dos for the week. We would recommend that students also complete some or all of the can-dos. We understand that some of the can-dos require the use of technology and that some families may not have a device or WIFI available to them, so we will understand if some students cannot complete online assignments at the Preschool through 4th grade levels.</p>
<p>Students must complete and turn in hard copies of each day’s assignment to their teacher upon returning to in-person classes in April. Students without internet access in the home, without the ability to print assignments, or who have accessibility issues related to Blizzard Bag content should ask their teacher for help or for hard copies of each day’s assignment. Hard copies will also be available at the District Office at 90 N. East St. in Pickerington.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions about your student’s work, the Blizzard Bags, or any of the assignments, we are asking that you first email your student’s classroom teacher. Here is a link to the </span><a href="https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLSD staff directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to locate teacher email addresses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Blizzard Bags are in a choice board format. In each choice board, you will find daily expectations, must-dos for the week and can dos for the week. The minimum expectation for each  student is to complete the daily expectations and the must-dos for the week. We would recommend that students also complete some or all of the can-dos. We understand that some of the can-dos require the use of technology and that some families may not have a device or WIFI available to them, so we will understand if some students cannot complete online assignments at the Preschool through 4th grade levels.</span></p>
<p>Students must complete and turn in hard copies of each day’s assignment to their teacher upon returning to in-person classes in April. Students without internet access in the home, without the ability to print assignments, or who have accessibility issues related to Blizzard Bag content should ask their teacher for help or for hard copies of each day’s assignment. Hard copies will also be available at the District Office at 90 N. East St. in Pickerington.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions about your student’s work, the Blizzard Bags, or any of the assignments, we are asking that you first email your student’s classroom teacher. Here is a link to the </span><a href="https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLSD staff directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to locate teacher email addresses.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since all students in grades 5-8 have PLSD One-to-One device, we will utilize </span><a href="http://classroom.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Classroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all classwork. Students will need to log in with their Pickerington Schools account and password. To view the Blizzard Bags for each course, students will need to click on the appropriate class tile and enter the Google Classroom. Teachers post the information on their class stream under classwork. This gives teachers the ability to make assignments based on what students currently are studying in class or other topics that relate to state standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week, teachers on each team will release choice boards of all assignments for the week. These assignments cover Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies and elective classes. The choice board is a way for students and parents to see all of the work for the week in one place. Also, this allows for the teams of teachers to plan together and create meaningful work while students are at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, to the curriculum assignments, students in grades 5-8 must complete the check-in daily which is located on the top of the choice boards. This check-in serves as a way for teachers to connect with students daily in order to continue their strong teacher-student relationship.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>If the district takes any calamity days before Feb. 17, 2020, (Presidents Day) we will use that day as a make-up day.</li>
<li>Days 2-4 will be identified as “Blizzard Bag” days. Teachers will provide these work-at-home lessons for students to complete when not in class. Information on Blizzard Bags can be found below.</li>

<p>Pickerington Schools is a large and geographically diverse district. Weather and road conditions may be fine in one portion of the district, but not in another. In such instances, we must close school or modify the school day for the entire district.</p>

                        <p>We strive to make the decision to delay or close by 5:30 a.m. or earlier so we can notify radio and TV stations, post to the district website, and send electronic notices to emergency announcement subscribers.</p>
<p>Unusual weather conditions may force us to make the decision after this time. For that reason, parents and students are advised to stay tuned to major television and radio stations, as well as our website and e-communications notices, for updates.</p>
<p>Once a decision is made to delay or close school, the information will be shared with parents as quickly as possible.</p>

                        <p><strong>Blizzard Bags on Snow and Inclement Weather Days (this is a different protocol than with Blizzard Bags for Coronavirus Closure Days mentioned above)</strong></p>
<p>If the district takes any calamity days before Feb. 17, 2020, (Presidents Day) we will use that day as a make-up day, regardless of whether the district has reached the five-day limit of excusable days.</p>
<p>Days 2-4 will be identified as “Blizzard Bag” days. Teachers will provide these work-at-home lessons for students to complete when not in class.</p>
<p>Blizzard bags are at-home assignments students are required to do in place of attending school on certain snow/calamity days. Blizzard Bag assignments take the place of the work students would have performed had school been in session. Students who fail to complete their Blizzard Bag assignments and turn them in within 10 school days will be marked with an unexcused absence for that day.</p>
<p>Assignments for Preschool through Grade 4 will be posted on this page.</p>
<p>Teachers in grades 5-12 will place their assignments on Google Classroom by 9 a.m. on the calamity day.</p>
<p>Students with questions about using Google Classroom are encouraged to talk to their teachers before they need to access their Blizzard Bag assignments.</p>
