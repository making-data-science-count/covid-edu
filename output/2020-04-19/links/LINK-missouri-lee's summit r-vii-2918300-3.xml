<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What do I need to know about the decision to close schools?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 16, 2020, Lee’s Summit R-7 Schools, in coordination with Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, the Coordinating School Districts of Greater Kansas City and Jackson County, announced school closures from Monday, March 23, 2020 through Friday, April 3, 2020 to minimize risk for students and staff and limit the spread of the novel coronavirus in our local and global community. <strong>On March 21, 2020, metro school districts agreed to extend school closures through April 24, 2020.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district will provide virtual learning opportunities, as well as services such as nutrition, during this school closure period. The district will follow guidance from local and state health and education partners in determining whether to extend the closure beyond April 24, 2020.</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">Will any buildings or Central Office be open during closure?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the majority of our employees will be tele-commuting, a limited number of critical staff may report to the district’s Central Office or to other district sites as part of their job function. Families should expect that most employees will be working remotely and are best reached via email. School buildings will not be open to families and staff, unless otherwise specified. Health clerks will work directly with families to coordinate how to get medications currently in the building to families.</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">How will LSR7 be communicating?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee’s Summit R-7 Schools leaders will continue to communicate regularly with the Jackson County Health Department and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services regarding any additional steps we should be taking to address the spread of the novel coronavirus. District leaders will also continue to monitor Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to share with our families. The district will continue to proactively communicate updates directly to staff and families, as well as on its dedicated novel coronavirus website: </span><a href="http://lsr7.org/coronavirus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lsr7.org/coronavirus.</span></a></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">Will LSR7 continue to clean school buildings?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district’s facilities team will deep clean and sanitize buildings during this time of closure.</span></p>

<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">When will LSR7 families be able to access virtual learning?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district will hold a staff-only virtual instructional planning day on Monday, March 23. Students will begin accessing virtual lessons starting on Tuesday, March 24, 2020. Again, Monday, March 23rd is designated as a virtual planning day for teachers.  </span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">Why is the district providing virtual instruction?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee’s Summit R-7 Schools remains committed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing students instructional activities and connections to the learning environment during this period of unprecedented school closures. We are fortunate to be a 1:1 district in which K-12 students have district-issued Chromebooks and R-7 staff have a platform in Schoology to reach students remotely. While virtual instruction cannot replace time in the classroom, Lee’s Summit R-7 Schools believes it is critical that we stay connected to our students and continue to provide learning opportunities to the best of our ability. The district’s technology department is actively addressing how to meet connectivity and Internet accessibility needs for students and staff. Teachers will leave assignments on their voicemails for students with Internet access challenges.</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What will a virtual instruction day look like?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that providing learning outside of our schools will look and operate differently for each of our students and staff. We will provide structure and normalcy for our school community by setting clear expectations regarding how students and staff should engage in virtual learning each day, while offering a level of flexibility and autonomy appropriate for the situation we find ourselves in.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every teacher will use the Schoology platform to share lessons, assignments and resources with students. The platform has a video conferencing tool, a parent access portal and ways to organize digital content. Parents/students should plan to download that app if their child doesn’t already have it on their device.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building leaders and teachers will be reaching out to families in the coming days, including what virtual instruction will look like for our youngest learners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers will post assignments and learning opportunities each week day by 9 a.m. Teachers will hold daily office hours to guide and assist students. Teachers will communicate with students via email, Schoology Conferences, Schoology Messaging and voicemail, which will be updated each day with assignments for students without Internet access.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are expected to access and complete assignments, meet deadlines, engage in the work and communicate with their teachers, peers or parents if they are confused. Lessons will range from 10 to 30 minutes depending on age level. Teachers will decide if assignments are graded.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families looking for information about Internet access, please visit<a href="http://tech.lsr7.org/2203/internet-options-updates-due-to-novel-coronavirus-pandemic/"> this link</a> for more information. </span></p>

<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">Will the district need to make up the days spent out of the classroom during closure?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are in close contact with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) regarding information about whether LSR7 and other school districts will be required to make up lost instructional time. </span><a href="https://dese.mo.gov/communications/coronavirus-covid-19-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect more information and guidance to come.</span></a></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What other resources are available for at-home learning?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Schoology platform will provide multiple resources for students to support learning and engagement via links and other connection opportunities.</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What’s the best way to contact a teacher or building leader?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to contact your child’s teacher or a building leader is to email them or leave them a voicemail during this time.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to contact teachers via Schoology messenger. </span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What are my options for virtual learning/teaching if I don’t have Internet at home?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are fortunate to be a 1:1 district and all of our students K-12 have district-issued Chromebooks. Prior to the pandemic and as part of its normal protocols, LSR7 issued hotspots to high schoolers who needed them and allowed middle schoolers to check out hot spots from the library. Moving forward, LSR7 is exploring for students and staff who have Internet accessibility and/or connectivity issues at home. Last week, the district issued a survey to students and staff to determine these needs. The district is working directly with students and staff to dispatch additional hotspots and Chromebooks, and/or other solutions, to families and staff members who need them to learn or perform their job remotely. Teachers will leave assignments on their voicemails for students with additional Internet access challenges. Building leaders and teachers will be reaching out directly to students who have indicated they have no or limited Internet at home.</span></p>

<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">How will the district support those who rely on the district for food during closure?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition Services will be providing breakfast and lunch packs to families during our school closure.  Any student 18 and under can receive a breakfast and a lunch Monday through Friday. Breakfast for the next day and lunch for the current day will be available at the following locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buses will deliver meals to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashbrooke Apartments, Sage Crossing Apartments, NE Knollbrook Street and NE Knollbrook Place, NE Ridgeview Drive &amp; NE Swann Rd, and Crossroads of Lee’s Summit Apartments on Town Centre 11-11:30 a.m.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westvale Crossroads, Oxford Place Townhomes, 11:45-12:15 a.m.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strasbourg Apartments, NW O’Brien Road West Entrance, 12:20 - 12:45 p.m</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents and children should watch for the buses. Volunteers will be on the buses ready to hand out the meals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Drive through" sites will be located at the Lee’s Summit North High School, Trailridge Elementary and Prairie View Elementary parking lots from 11:45 a.m.-12:30 p.m.  Parents can drive up and request the number of meals they need.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district added two additional drive-through locations at Lee’s Summit HIgh School’s front parking lot from 10:30 to 11 a.m. and Mason Elementary’s parking lot from 11:20 a.m. to 12: 15 p.m.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meals are for students only; not adults. For questions regarding the meal plan, contact Lori Danella at (816) 986-2206 or lori.danella@lsr7.net.</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What special education services will my child be able to access during this time?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students on IEPs will be provided with materials in the same manner as general education students and have access to instructional support via email, phone call or video call. Modifications and accommodations will be provided to the extent possible and necessary. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific materials and/or video conferencing will be provided, as appropriate, for making progress on IEP goals. Some students will require services to be made up upon return due to the nature of the services. If the state forgives any non-attendance days, this will be applied to making up services as well.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Related Service providers will provide materials where possible, but some students will require services to be made up upon return due to the nature of the services.</span></li>

<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What is the impact on events such as prom, graduation, athletics and student activities?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the closure of school buildings through Friday, April 24th, all extracurricular activities, athletics and school-related events, as well as student and staff travel and Before and After School Services, are cancelled. These events include but are not limited to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday, March 23 - “Meet the superintendent, Learn about the bond” at the Missouri Innovation Campus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday, March 26 - Kindergarten Round Up at all elementary schools</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, March 28 - Lee’s Summit High School Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony postponed to June 14, 2020. </span><a href="http://www3.lsr7.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LSHS-Hall-of-Fame-Postponement-2020.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2FGCV3RJ2AgDdAioFK63wLd8zWNqih4jXsLnb8lc9L-0akEpLEBAWAVGU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More info here.</span></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, information about Summer Learning Institute courses and enrollment is on hold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of Jackson County executive orders banning gatherings of 10 or more people through May 15, and despite efforts to look for alternative solutions, the district has cancelled prom for all three high schools. We are seeking additional guidance on how CDC and government guidelines and social-distancing mandates could impact our graduation ceremonies and will strive to communicate additional information with families as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What is the impact of novel coronavirus on the April 7, 2020 election?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, March 18th, Gov. Mike Parson signed an executive order moving all Missouri municipal elections previously scheduled for April 7, 2020 to June 2, 2020. Only voters who have turned 18 by April 7 will be permitted to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Governor’s Office also shared the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closing date to register to vote in this election remains March 11.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline for filing as a write-in candidate for office remains March 27 at 5 p.m.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to apply for an absentee ballot (Section 115.279, RSMo) shall be May 20.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A public test of voting equipment shall be completed no later than June 1.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-person absentee ballots may be cast until 5 p.m. on June 1.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline by which absentee ballots must be received by the election authority (Section 115.293.1, RSMo) shall be 7 p.m. on June 2.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military and overseas voters must request a ballot from an election authority by 5 p.m. on May 29, and the deadline for local election authorities to make ballots available to such voters is April 18. Military and overseas ballots must be received by the election authority by June 5.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local election authorities are also directed to post information on their website, use social media if available, issue press release, conduct public appearances, and directly contact stakeholders such as candidates.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What about AP, MAP, ACT and other scheduled testing?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 19th, the Missouri Dept. of Elementary &amp; Secondary Education </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MOEducation/status/1240764412228755458?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cancelled statewide assessments for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll review the impacts of this decision. For now, we’re grateful for this opportunity to provide students and staff the support and grace that they need right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will continue to seek information about AP and IB tests. The spring ACT tests have been cancelled and the district is looking at opportunities to reschedule.</span></p>

<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">How should I talk with children about the coronavirus?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain calm and reassuring.  Children will react to and follow your verbal and nonverbal reactions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not talking about it can increase anxiety in children.  Children often imagine situations far worse than reality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep discussion simple, factual, and concrete.  Here is a resource that provides specific guidelines to parents: </span><a href="https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources-and-podcasts/school-climate-safety-and-crisis/health-crisis-resources/talking-to-children-about-covid-19-(coronavirus)-a-parent-resource"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to Children About COVID-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assure children that adults at home and at school are taking care of your health and safety.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain that not everyone will get the novel coronavirus. School and health officials are being especially careful to make sure as few people as possible get sick.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review and model basic hygiene practices such as handwashing and coughing or sneezing into elbows.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor television viewing and social media.  Try to avoid watching or listening to information that might be upsetting when your children are present.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain a normal routine to the extent possible.  Keeping to a regular schedule can be reassuring and promotes physical health.</span></li>

<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What can I do to help myself, my family and my community during this time?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are sick, stay home, stay in touch with your doctor and avoid public transportation. Stay away from others, and call ahead to a doctor for further instructions. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More from the CDC here.</span></a>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice respiratory etiquette. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash your hands frequently using soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. You may also use hand sanitizer when it is difficult to wash your hands.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes because the virus can spread when your hands touch surfaces infested with germs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. If a tissue is not available, sneezing or coughing into the upper portion of your shirt sleeve and avoid sneezing or coughing into your hands (which are more likely to touch surfaces and other people and spread the disease).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not share drinks, water bottles, eating utensils or cell phones with others.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“social distancing.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Limit all events and meetings that require close contact. Stay informed. Whether you are ill or not, the goal is to limit the spread of the coronavirus and protect the most vulnerable in our population from exposure.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean high-touch surfaces everyday. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fhome%2Fcleaning-disinfection.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More from the CDC here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be kind to each other. The novel coronavirus has impacted every race, ethnicity and nationality. Do not perpetuate stigma. Share accurate information. And take care of yourself, your family and fellow members of your school and larger community.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What can I do to support the community?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What should I know about the coronavirus?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novel coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a virus strain that has spread in people since December 2019 and has caused severe illness and pneumonia. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms most commonly include: fever with cough or shortness of breath; Some people have fewer or no symptoms at all.  Headache, sore throat, and runny nose also occur with this virus.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread is most likely from droplets (cough and sneezing)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people with this infection will recover on their own. There is no specific vaccine for novel coronavirus infection yet. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For patients who are more severely ill, hospitals can provide supportive care.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that individuals with symptoms should call a doctor for instructions before seeking medical care.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="color: #618ea5;">What should I do if I feel sick or I have been in direct contact with someone who is?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC has outlined specific action steps to take if you feel ill with symptoms of the coronavirus or flu. Find them </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve fielded many questions regarding whether individuals who have had secondary or tertiary exposure to COVID-19 should isolate. While any individual with uncertainty about guidelines should seek the guidance of the local health department, we have been told that individuals who are NOT experiencing symptoms and have had secondary or tertiary contact with someone who has a positive case of COVID-19 are not required to be under isolation. These individuals should monitor themselves closely, including taking their temperature regularly, for the development of symptoms. Only direct, first-person contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, those experiencing symptoms and </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travelers from specific areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be required to isolate by health officials.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Missouri DHSS has created a COVID-19 hotline to provide guidance and answer questions from citizens and healthcare providers.  The number is 877-435-8411. This number can be reached 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is being operated by medical professionals.</span></li>

<p>Throughout the weekend, Lee’s Summit R-7 School District leaders continued to communicate closely with the Jackson County Health Department, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and education leaders at the local and state level.</p>
<p>While Jackson County has zero confirmed cases of novel coronavirus as of this time, public health officials have made clear that we have reached a point where we must take every precaution to minimize risk to students and staff and our larger local and global community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.csdgkc.org/2019/03/16/kc-area-school-districts-announce-closure/">In partnership with Jackson County, the Cooperating School Districts of Greater Kansas City and the Office of Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas</a>, Lee’s Summit R-7 Schools will close from Monday, March 23, 2020 through Friday, April 3, 2020, upon which the district will decide whether to reopen or extend the closure.</p>
<p>We did not make this decision lightly, as we know that closing school buildings represents hardships for many of our families. We’re gathering additional guidance from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Specifics regarding how staff and families should access online learning, as well as how we plan to provide food, Internet access options and other services to families who need them will be provided this week.</p>
<p>During this time, all extracurricular activities, athletics, after school events, such as Kindergarten Round Up, and student and staff travel will be cancelled. Since district buildings will be closed, Before and After School Services will also be cancelled. </p>
<p>Our mission at Lee’s Summit R-7 Schools is to prepare all students for success and in the upcoming weeks we will do everything we can to serve students. </p>
<p><strong>12:30 p.m.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Lee’s Summit R-7 Schools has not yet announced school closures as of today, March 16, 2020, we are proactively working with local and state public health officials to evaluate the option of school closure on a daily basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take this potential decision very seriously because we know that cancelling school will represent various hardships for many students and staff who rely on the district for certain services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the district participated in a webinar with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which reaffirmed its stance on local control so that local health and education partners can make a decision on school closures collaboratively. </span><b>The Jackson County Health Department has indicated to us that we can expect further guidance this week regarding school closures.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the district's situation changes we will promptly communicate with our families through our normal channels. In the meantime, in order to be in accordance with Jackson County executive orders and other state and federal guidance to cancel group events of 50 people or more, we are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancelling all student activities and athletics over spring break, restricting non-essential visitors to school buildings and discontinuing use of our facilities by external groups. Additional guidance will come as the district determines whether it will be in session on March 23rd.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancelling other district events, such as the district’s “meet and greet” and bond-issue Q+A night scheduled with Dr. David Buck on Monday, March 23rd at the Missouri Innovation Campus. We will evaluate and communicate any impact to LSR7 proms and graduations this week.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discontinuing Before and After School Services field trips; initiating plans for the 100 kids participating in BASS this week to be separated in smaller groups; limiting parent access to buildings. Parents should know that it is possible BASS will be cancelled in the event of a school closure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep-cleaning and sanitizing all LSR7 buildings over spring break and limiting access to school sites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actively preparing for a school closure scenario by finalizing plans to provide virtual instruction and other social emotional provisions for students during a potential school closure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your patience and understanding as the district continues to proactively address this unprecedented health crisis.  This is a rapidly-changing situation and families should know that our plans may evolve at any time. Families should expect to receive additional communication from us soon.</span></p>

This is a rapidly-evolving scenario and families and staff should expect that the district’s plans could change at any time.

<li dir="ltr">The district will not permit external groups to rent or use our facilities over spring so that our buildings can be deep cleaned and sanitized. As of today, BASS is still in session for spring break.</li>

<li>While school closures are not something we are predicting, it is important for all of us to prepare to implement home instruction, if necessary.</li>
<li>Watch for an email from the LSR7 Technology Department with a survey about access to technology at your home. While you have received similar surveys in the past, it is important for you to complete this survey as soon as possible so that the district has the most up-to-date information.</li>

Symptoms are similar to the flu - cough, fever, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. More information can be found at </span><a href="http://health.mo.gov/coronavirus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="http://health.mo.gov/coronavirus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">health.mo.gov/coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no reported cases of coronavirus in Missouri at this time, we are closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak and reviewing information from the Jackson County Health Department, the Missouri Department of Health and the CDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also took steps to address this rapidly-changing situation by having conversations this week about any additional proactive and preventative approaches we can take as we progress through the cold and flu season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district has taken or will take the following steps to ensure student and staff health:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The district will continue to communicate closely </span><a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/novel-coronavirus/pdf/schools-coronavirus.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with county health professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">District nurses will continue to monitor and track student illnesses, and review </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/takingcare.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC and state health department guidance.</span></a>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district will continue to use both routine cleaning methods and specialized decontamination equipment to provide extra disinfection efforts in classrooms and school buildings that have reported an uptick in illnesses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R-7 Health Services staff members have attended training sessions regarding the possibility of a pandemic flu virus, and the district’s Emergency Operations Team has also received pandemic-flu information. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure its proactive approach, the district is evaluating its own current crisis and emergency procedures related to health and illness in collaboration with health department and law enforcement partners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district is continuing to explore virtual school (tele-school) options for a scenario in which the health department recommends school cancellations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The district will reinforce best practices to prevent the spread of flu, influenza and other viruses to staff and students. </span><b>The number one way to stop the spread of illness remains to stay home if you are displaying any symptoms.</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respiratory viruses are transmitted from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or when a person touches something that has the flu virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, eyes or nose. While most of the population is at a greater risk of contracting seasonal influenza than coronavirus, it is essential that we partner to prevent the spread of all illnesses by embracing the following practices:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying home if you are sick with the flu or are presenting symptoms of the flu to prevent spreading it to others at school and in the workplace. If you believe you or your children are becoming ill with influenza-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue), contact your local healthcare provider.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practicing frequent hand washing using soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. You may also use hand sanitizer when it is difficult to wash your hands.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding touching your mouth, nose and eyes because the virus can spread when your hands touch surfaces infested with germs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remembering to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. If a tissue is not available, sneezing or coughing into the upper portion of your shirt sleeve and avoid sneezing or coughing into your hands (which are more likely to touch surfaces and other people and spread the disease).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sharing drinks, water bottles, eating utensils or cell phones with others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practicing “social distancing,” especially in the case of a pandemic. Stand at least three feet away from others if you or the other person is infected with the flu.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that children and adults are fever-free for 24 hours without medication before returning to work or school.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, getting a flu shot. How do you tell the difference between the common cold and the flu? If you have a stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat and a hacking cough, you probably have a cold. If you have a high fever, extreme tiredness, a dry cough and severe headache, muscle and body aches, you probably have the flu.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be assured that district staff take health concerns seriously and will be monitoring illness in schools, and that we will share additional information </span></p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">The district will continue to use both routine cleaning methods and specialized decontamination equipment to provide extra disinfection efforts in classrooms and school buildings that have reported an uptick in illnesses.</li>
<li dir="ltr">R-7 Health Services staff members and the district’s Emergency Operations Team have also received pandemic-flu information.</li>
<li dir="ltr">To ensure its proactive approach, the district is evaluating its own current crisis and emergency procedures related to health and illness in collaboration with health department and law enforcement partners.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The district is continuing to explore virtual school (tele-school) options for a scenario in which the health department recommends school cancellations.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The district will reinforce best practices to prevent the spread of flu, influenza and other viruses to staff and students. The number one way to stop the spread of illness remains to stay home if you are displaying any symptoms.</li>

<h2 class="uk-text-left">        Prevention Measures at Home    </h2>
<div class="uk-margin uk-margin-remove-bottom">
<p dir="ltr">Respiratory viruses are transmitted from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or when a person touches something that has the flu virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, eyes or nose. While most of the population is at a greater risk of contracting seasonal influenza than coronavirus, it is essential that we partner to prevent the spread of all illnesses by embracing the following practices:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Staying home if you are sick with the flu or are presenting symptoms of the flu to prevent spreading it to others at school and in the workplace. If you believe you or your children are becoming ill with influenza-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue), contact your local healthcare provider.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Practicing frequent hand washing using soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. You may also use hand sanitizer when it is difficult to wash your hands.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Avoiding touching your mouth, nose and eyes because the virus can spread when your hands touch surfaces infested with germs.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Remembering to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. If a tissue is not available, sneezing or coughing into the upper portion of your shirt sleeve and avoid sneezing or coughing into your hands (which are more likely to touch surfaces and other people and spread the disease).</li>
<li dir="ltr">Not sharing drinks, water bottles, eating utensils or cell phones with others.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Practicing “social distancing,” especially in the case of a pandemic. Stand at least three feet away from others if you or the other person is infected with the flu.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Ensuring that children and adults are fever-free for 24 hours without medication before returning to work or school.</li>
<li dir="ltr">If possible, getting a flu shot. How do you tell the difference between the common cold and the flu? If you have a stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat and a hacking cough, you probably have a cold. If you have a high fever, extreme tiredness, a dry cough and severe headache, muscle and body aches, you probably have the flu.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Be assured that district staff take health concerns seriously and will be monitoring illness in schools, and that we will share additional information or guidance we receive from county, state and federal health professionals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If we all work together and follow these important guidelines, we can keep our students, staff, and community healthy.</p>
