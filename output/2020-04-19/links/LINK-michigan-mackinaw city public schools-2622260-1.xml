<p>We are not being advised to close schools or modify our instructional practices at this time.  Any decision to implement a school closure in anticipation of, or in response to, community spread of COVID-19 would be made under the direction of public health agencies and/or the Michigan Department of Health &amp; Human Services. We have not received that direction at this time, and we will continue to monitor and communicate about any possible impact to our school community.  </p>

<p>In the event of a closure, we will work with our teachers to develop a plan for students to ensure that student learning continues outside the classroom. </p>

<p>If the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services advises our district to close in response to the virus, we will notify families using our traditional methods for emergency announcements, including: Remind 101, local television and radio stations, school Facebook page and school website.  Please make sure our school has your updated contact information, and please follow the district's social media (Remind 101/Facebook) to ensure you are receiving all school communications. </p>

<p><a name="What%20if%20a%20student%20travels%20outside%20the%20U.S.%20or%20on%20a%20planned%20cruise?"><strong>What if a student travels outside the U.S. or on a planned cruise?</strong></a></p>

<p>We strongly advise all students, faculty, and staff  follow travel alerts from the CDC and Department of State. Currently, the CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to any countries in Europe, South Korea, Iran, and China. The CDC has also issued an advisory for cruise ship travel. If you or someone in your family has traveled to one of these countries or is planning a cruise, you MUST adhere to CDC guidelines upon return, including self-quarantines &amp; re-entry processes for resuming school attendance. Please refer to the CDC guidelines provided on their website: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html</a></p>

<p>If a student travels to a Level 3 CDC COVID-19 warning area, please notify the school before returning. Please refer to the updated CDC published list of Level 3 countries, which is subject to change at any time: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html</a></p>

<p>If a student or family member becomes ill after traveling anywhere within or outside the United States, contact your doctor and the school immediately. Your doctor will work with the local health department to determine the proper diagnosis and protocol.</p>

<p>If student does not travel but family members do, he or she may attend school unless someone in the home has symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath).</p>

<p>If a family member becomes ill, a student should self-quarantine until a doctor determines it is safe for the student to return to school.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><a name="Should%20a%20student%20wear%20a%20mask%20to%20school?"><strong>Should a student wear a mask to school?</strong></a></p>

<p>The CDC does not recommend wearing a face mask to protect against respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, with the exception of medical professionals exposed to disease on daily basis. Face masks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others.</p>

<p>If a student is experiencing symptoms, he or she should not be at school. </p>

<p><a name="How%20is%20the%20school%20being%20cleaned?"><strong>How is the school being cleaned?</strong></a></p>

<p>Our district consistently uses best practices for cleaning and disinfecting schools with approved disinfectants. Hard surfaces, such as desks, tables, water fountains, doorknobs, light switches, and bathroom fixtures are regularly cleaned using a disinfectant. If necessary, more steps will be taken for focused deep cleaning of areas within the building.</p>

<p>In response to any previous cases of widespread illness such as influenza, our district regularly re-assesses cleaning procedures to determine if additional measures are necessary. We pride ourselves in having avoided closures during local influenza outbreaks, due to our stringent cleaning procedures.</p>

<p>Our food service program always follows federal guidelines for proper food handling and personal hygiene practices to prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria to food. Our kitchen area is sanitized daily, proper hand washing techniques are employed, and bare hand contact with food is avoided. </p>

<p>Keep your student home if ill - the main symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. If your student has any of the following symptoms, they should be kept home: fever (without medication), vomiting, diarrhea, undiagnosed rash, green or yellow discharge from nose, an inflamed throat, persistent cough, redness or discharge from the eyes, or an elevated temperature. Preventing the spread of any illness is everyone's responsibility, and keeping sick children home will help preserve the safety of all students and prevent transmission within schools.</p>

<p>Have a plan in place to pick your children up quickly should they become ill at school.</p>

<p>Encourage and help children wash hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water is not available, use hand sanitizer. Remind children to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Remind them cover their mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing.</p>

<p>Avoid contact with people who are ill - do not bring your children to visit others who are ill. </p>

<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>

<p>Cover cough with a tissue or sleeve. </p>

<p>Provide adequate supplies within easy reach, including tissues and hand sanitizer.</p>

<p>Disinfect common area surfaces and objects, especially phones and items that may touch your face.</p>
