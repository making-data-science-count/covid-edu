<p dir="ltr">To the MRH Community, </p>

<p dir="ltr">The Maplewood Richmond Heights School District, along with every school system in St. Louis County and City, announces today that buildings will remain closed through the end of this school year. Learning and support services will continue through at least our final scheduled day of school, May 22. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Friends, this decision was extremely difficult, but it is imperative that we take bold measures to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and help save lives in our community. This decision follows recommendations from local health departments and is in collaboration with government officials, as well. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Many of you have questions and concerns regarding end-of-year events such as graduations and promotions. MRH teams have been studying alternatives for “virtual” ceremonies; more information is forthcoming. The decisions we ultimately make will be in the best interests of the health and safety of our students, staff, and communities. </p>

<p dir="ltr">While our school buildings are closed, our commitment to providing support for our students, staff, families, and community remains unwavering.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Please stay safe, and look after one another,</p>

<p>The St. Louis County Department of Public Health is striving to provide easy access to important information, statistics, testing criteria, and contact information to those in St. Louis County. To achieve that end, a new dashboard has been created and can be accessed from <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.stlcorona.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585694005911000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMsL_yt3-H_ssOvqBeLUl4pHSv5w" href="http://www.stlcorona.com/" target="_blank">www.stlcorona.com</a>.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the daily updates pertaining to COVID-19 that are provided by the St. Louis County Department of Public Health will look slightly different. They will focus more on educational/informational materials, that will likely support trends, emerging information, or other topics that need more of a focus. Numbers associated with positive cases, calls for service, and other data will no longer be provided in these updates. Instead, they will be displayed in the easily accessible dashboard.</p>

The practice will bring local health departments to a consistent level of the timing and reporting of the numbers. Today, 3/24/2020, should be the first and only day this issue occurs. </p>

<p>Today, as of 5:00 PM, the St. Louis County Department of Public Health (DPH) has:</p>

<ul>
<li>One death.</li>
	<li>90 total positive cases, an increase of 35 new positive cases from yesterday’s 55.</li>
	<li>The St. Louis County Department of Health fielded a total of 396 calls on 3/22/2020.</li>

<p>Due to the volume of results now available, the ability to provide data on each positive case has diminished. It is unlikely that we will be able to provide age ranges for those testing positive for COVID-19 on a daily basis with a short turnaround. We are evaluating the most appropriate and realistic way to proceed to continue to provide the public with the best information possible.</p>

<p>Epidemiological investigations indicate there is clear evidence of community transmission in St. Louis County.</p>

<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), “community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.”</p>

<p>Today, as of 5:00 PM, the St. Louis County Department of Public Health (DPH) has:</p>

<ul>
<li>One death.</li>
	<li>55 total positive cases.</li>
	<li>The St. Louis County Department of Health fielded a total of 330 calls on 3/21/2020.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>MRH: "Stay at Home" orders will not require a change of plans for continued instruction and meal delivery.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">By now, many of you are likely aware of today’s Executive Orders by leaders in St. Louis County and the State of Missouri establishing stay-at-home restrictions beginning Monday, March 23. We as a school community are fortunate that the new Orders do not require the Maplewood Richmond Heights School District to alter or deviate from our original plan for continued learning and meal delivery which we sent to you earlier this week. </p>

<p dir="ltr">MRH is considered an “essential” institution under definitions issued by the St. Louis County Department of Health order:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>“Schools and other entities that ordinarily provide food services to students or members of the public may continue to do so under this Order provided that the food is provided to students or members of the public on a pick-up and take-away basis only. Schools and other entities that provide food services under this paragraph shall not permit the food to be eaten onsite.”</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Order defines “essential travel”:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>“...travel to or from educational institutions for purposes of receiving materials for distance learning, for receiving meals, and any other related services…”</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">In other words, our plan for providing healthy school meals to our students is unchanged! </p>

<p dir="ltr">To recap: starting Wednesday, March 25th, the District will be providing "To Go" meals for MRH students through Friday, April 3rd at each of our buildings. Meal pickup is between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm each weekday. This will be a curbside pick-up, so please remain in your vehicle. If you are walking, please maintain a 6-ft distance from our employees and we will assist you.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the time of pickup, a packaged lunch for the day will be provided as well as a breakfast for the following day. If we are able to provide more meals at one time, we will do so and notify you at time of pick-up. Meals will be provided free of cost for all MRH students and you may visit one location for multiple students (ex. siblings who attend different buildings). Please have your student name(s) ready. </p>

<p dir="ltr">You may choose to fill out this online <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bz0quqNYlQYiPph6F6PU6NsG1p-pZwiWcvhHrX5WJnQ/viewform?edit_requested=true&amp;fbclid=IwAR1LEsjxR7azPoA4E_17QqHQ6c80pct64CeyDhwQDeKx3eymVqQGWkINgxw">form </a>to hopefully make this transaction smoother. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Dear MRH Families,</p>

<p>Administrators of the Maplewood Richmond Heights School District have been making plans this week to ensure that student learning continues in the midst of the current health crisis. We appreciate your patience as we all work through this unprecedented series of events. </p>

<p>This message includes several important updates regarding school operations during the extended closure period through Friday, April 3. Please read this message carefully and watch for additional updates soon from your child’s principal and teachers. In addition, bookmark <a href="http://www.mrhschools.net">www.mrhschools.net</a> for resources, updates and information.</p>

<p>Student instruction will resume on Wednesday, March 25 in various remote, alternative learning formats. The District has been surveying families of students in all grade levels to determine which students will carry out their lessons in an on-line fashion and which will work from hard-copy packets. Your principals will be sharing much more specific information via email on Thursday afternoon, March 19. </p>

<p>Also on Thursday, March 19, you will receive specific information about how the District will go about providing free meals to our students. The system will involve curbside pickup sites at each school building during a mid-morning/early afternoon time frame beginning on Wednesday, March 25. </p>

<p>Additionally, your respective principals will be notifying you of times set aside on Tuesday, March 24, to stop by your child’s school(s) to retrieve any necessary lesson packets, electronic learning devices, or medications. </p>

<p>We can not overemphasize the importance of being watchful for MRH emails over the next few days. </p>

<p>Friends, this is not the Spring Break which anyone imagined. Already, we are seeing a tremendous outpouring of support from the MRH community. Our pledge is this: we will not lose sight of our mission to prepare your children as leaders, scholars, stewards and citizens for a diverse and changing world.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Be safe,</p>

<p>MRH District Open House Canceled</p>

<p>The Maplewood Richmond Heights School District Open House event has been canceled for Saturday, April 4. Government health authorities have advised against unnecessary public gatherings due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus Covid-19. The open house event will not be rescheduled during the existing school year.</p>

<p><em>For more information, contact MRH School District at (314) 644-4400.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">March 15, 2020</p>

<p>The Maplewood Richmond Heights School District has canceled classes until at least Monday, April 6. This decision was reached today following consultation with the St. Louis County Department of Health and with administrators of all public, private and parochial school districts throughout the County. The extended closure also includes the city of St. Louis Public Schools and districts throughout Jefferson County. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The decision - strongly recommended by the Health Department - was extremely difficult, made out of an abundance of caution. We know that closing our schools will have a significant impact on our families, but we also believe that urgent action must be taken to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus. In the interim, we will reevaluate that tentative April 6 return date based upon ongoing developments related to the scope of Covid-19 in our community. </p>

<p dir="ltr">During the closure period, all MRH events are suspended. Those include extracurricular activities such as athletic practices and competitions, clubs, field trips, ceremonies and after-school parent meetings.</p>

<p dir="ltr">MRH administrators are immediately evaluating the status of supplemental programs, including alternative instruction for K-12 students. We will issue details soon.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is likely that everyday life will continue to be affected by the challenges presented by COVID-19. MRH believes these difficult but proactive decisions will reduce the impact this virus will have on our school community. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Residents experiencing symptoms of fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, should contact the St. Louis County Health Line at (314) 615-2660 with their concerns. Those who have reason to believe they have encountered a person infected with COVID-19 should also use that number.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services hotline can be reached at (877) 435-8411.</p>

<p dir="ltr">St. Louis County has created a website dedicated to the dissemination of information relating to COVID-19, <a href="http://www.stlcorona.com/">www.stlcorona.com</a>.

<p dir="ltr">Use these ideas, based on Search Institute’s Developmental Relationships Framework*, with young people in your families, schools, and programs to respond in positive, relationship-enhancing ways to the interpersonal or prejudicial challenges that may surface during the coronavirus epidemic.</p>

<h3 class="paragraphheader" dir="ltr">Express Care: Show me that I matter to you.</h3>

<p dir="ltr">1. Take time to listen intently to young people’s concerns, questions, and ideas related to the pandemic. Don’t dismiss their fears, but seek to understand their source.</p>

<p dir="ltr">2. If your school or program suspends in-person programming to reduce the risks of spreading the virus, be intentional about maintaining virtual caring connections with young people. For example, take time during virtual classroom sessions to check in and maintain relationships.</p>

<h3 class="paragraphheader" dir="ltr">Challenge Growth: Push me to keep getting better.</h3>

<p dir="ltr">3. If you hear or see blatant or subtle bias or prejudice in conversations, in news coverage, or other places, challenge it. Talk about why blanket statements blaming a whole group of people for something is, by definition, a prejudice. What are healthy ways to respond?</p>

<p dir="ltr">4. Use this crisis as an opportunity to develop their critical thinking skills. When young people talk about or spread rumors, misinformation, and conspiracy theories, push them to dig for accurate information, scientific research, and credible sources to clarify the issues. If you’re in a classroom or program setting, find ways to tie the epidemic into what you’re learning.</p>

<h3 class="paragraphheader" dir="ltr">Provide Support: Help me complete tasks and achieve goals.</h3>

<p>5. When young people express interest in taking action to help those most affected by the coronavirus, ask them how you might be most helpful. Guide them to find ways they can respond that not only feel good to them, but are actually most useful to those who will receive the help.</p>

<p dir="ltr">6. If you know of people who are experiencing the brunt of prejudice or discrimination because of the coronavirus, find ways to stand in solidarity with them and invite others to do the same. As programs and schools temporarily move online, ensure that interactions remain supportive and negative interactions are dealt with in healthy ways.</p>

<h3 class="paragraphheader" dir="ltr">Share Power—Treat me with respect and give me a say.</h3>

<p>7. Young people will likely have creative and innovative ways to respond to the risks of the coronavirus. For example, ask them how they want to be greeted while staying healthy (e.g., “heel bumps” or sign language). Even when major issues are involved, such as whether to suspend in-person programming, give them a voice to be heard, even if they don’t make the final decision. (Adults may feel a need to make all the decisions about how to respond to coronavirus because it’s so serious. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t listen to young people, consider their ideas, and explain to them why you’re making the choices you’re making.)</p>

<p dir="ltr">8. In many cases, young people have a lot to teach older generations about avoiding stereotypes and building relationships across differences. Invite young people to talk with groups of adults about how they have learned to form those connections and how they have enriched their lives.</p>

<h3 class="paragraphheader" dir="ltr">Expand possibilities: Connect me with people and places that broaden my world.</h3>

<p dir="ltr">9. Although most of our attention may be focused on hunkering down, the coronavirus epidemic can also open young people to new ideas, new people, new places, and even new possibilities for their own futures. While taking the appropriate actions, also find ways to use these events as teachable moments that can expand how young people think of themselves and their work.</p>

<p dir="ltr">10. One of the best ways to confront bias and prejudice is to build a broad network of relationships with people from diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and cultures. That’s becoming harder to do in an increasingly polarized, fragmented society. Talk with young people about specific ways they already build connections across differences and other ways they would like to explore building bridges.</p>
