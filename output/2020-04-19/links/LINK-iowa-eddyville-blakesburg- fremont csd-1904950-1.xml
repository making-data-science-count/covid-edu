    <p><strong>April 18, 2020</strong></p>
<p>EBF Junior/Senior High families:</p>
<p>We are once again asking for more patience and grace as we try another round of video messaging.  Thank you for responses during the first attempt, last week.  We are working  to find a suitable platform that everyone can view.  Please view the link below.  If you are unable to access the video, let us know, so we can keep trying to keep you connected.</p>
<p>Stay safe and well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a id="LPlnk246137" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxkG_g50CDUcTKR0_u1Naqw95PIQQ0qI/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxkG_g50CDUcTKR0_u1Naqw95PIQQ0qI/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>April 18, 2020</strong></p>
<p>EBF Rocket Jr/Sr High Students and Parents:</p>
<p>On Friday, April 17 the Governor of the state of Iowa, along with the director of the Department of Education, announced that the closure of Iowa public school will be extended for the remainder of the year.  It shouldn’t have come to a surprise to us, and quite frankly, we have been preparing for this day…but to actually hear the words spoken has brought about a substantial amount of emotion from me and my staff. We want to be back in school.  We miss each other, and we miss our kids.  </p>
<p>Our motivation continues to be a relentless pursuit of educating our students in these times.  Our staff has done a tremendous job in the past 4 weeks to develop a continual online learning program.  Additionally, our staff has done a great job to mitigate barriers that have existed for students to access that program.  While still not perfect…we are at the stage in the game where we need to put added value into it. On April 10, the state of Iowa had mandated that school districts identify that their continual learning platform as either “voluntary” or “ required”.  At that time, we chose “voluntary”. Under voluntary, our students did not have to participate, and we could not issue grades. At this time, after addressing the final remaining issues that stood in front of us…we are now shifting our declaration in the Jr/Sr High School to a “Required” status with the state.   Starting Monday, April 20, all students will now be required to engage in our continual learning program.  Here are a few key notes regarding this:<br>Our continual learning schedule already established, will remain our schedule moving forward.  <strong>(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ClBljaFWJcXtm1Jt6btV5im9R1VVVSDH/view?usp=sharing)</strong></p>
<p>Grades and attendance will now be taken.  Infinite Campus will be back up and running.</p>
<p>Seniors:  We will meet virtually with you the week of April 20 to discuss your grading options.  In short, here is a quick summary of that….</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take a pass/fail based on the 7 weeks of academic progress made before closure.  If you choose to do this, you will not need to continue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take a fail grade and improve that to a pass by attending the remaining 3 weeks of our continual learning program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take a letter grade based on 7 weeks of academic progress prior to shut down, and in combination with the 3 remaining weeks of academic progress until May 8 (Last day for Seniors).  You will need to attend the remaining 3 weeks of our continued learning program.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students can pick and choose which classes they would like these options for.  Does not have to be an all or nothing. Online Senior meeting scheduled Monday, April 20 at 5 pm </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Grades 7-11:  We will take your 7 weeks of grades prior to closure, add our 6 remaining weeks of school and determine a semester grade by combining these.  Last Day of school, May 29</p>
<p>Flexibility is still a priority of ours and we are willing to accommodate:  Jobs, obligations to assist the family, connectivity challenges, etc.  Students not able to access the live sessions can go back and watch recorded sessions, and do the work on Google Classroom are considered to be attending our continual learning platform.  </p>
<p>Classes not listed on the schedule will be followed up individually by your teachers.  Check your email for those updates.  </p>
<p>The time has come to improve.  The time has come to take that step to better the education of our kids during this time.   By doing so, we can legitimately work towards grades, credits, and essentially shrinking the learning gaps that currently exist, and will continue to grow, if we do not step up for our kids now.  We know that this will not be perfect, but we will work towards perfection. Please communicate with teachers, with me, and let’s unite as we educate our students amidst these challenging circumstances.  Proud to be a Rocket!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Steve R. Noble, Principal</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>April 8, 2020</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Dear Elementary Families:</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Governor has recommended that Iowa schools will remain closed through April 30, 2020, for the continued health and safety of families. To help districts support student and family learning needs as flexibly as possible during this time, the Iowa Department of Education provided guidance on continuous learning during school closure. The state has defined two learning options for schools to select: voluntary or required. </p>
<p dir="ltr">At this time, the process to meet a “required educational services program” may not be sustainable for EBF Elementaries, therefore our schools will be taking a voluntary team centered approach to learning by developing online lessons, hard copy packets aligned with lessons and providing access to teachers. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Each building is working on lesson design, connectivity, and communication. The principals and teachers are working very hard to make online opportunities available beginning Monday April 13, 2020.  Paper packets will also be available each week during Grab and Go Meal pickup every Monday. </p>
<p dir="ltr">This is an attempt to partner with our families to fill a gap during the school closure.  We are very sensitive to what is going on in your lives as you have been thrown into a “Crisis Schooling” mode.  No grading will be given during the school closure period. The goal of the additional learning opportunities is to support families in keeping students academically engaged and to avoid knowledge gaps as they progress in their academic careers.  Schools partnering with families to offer continued teaching and learning opportunities for students will not be required by the state to make up missed days. </p>
<p dir="ltr">In the upcoming days, we will be sending out more information about online learning.  We know everyone is doing the best they can at this time and we want to encourage you to reach out if you have any questions. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Stay safe and well, </p>
<p dir="ltr">EBF Elementary Administrators</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>April 7, 2020</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As we continue to see spread of COVID-19, it is important that we are all doing our part to help slow it.  Per CDC recommendations, the key is to limit social contact as much as possible. It is important to remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places.  </p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If you are unable to stay home with your child while school is out, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide child care. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adults, such as a grandparent or someone with a chronic medical condition), limit your children’s contact with other people.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Consider postponing visits or trips to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Other important preventative measures continue to be:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Wash hands with warm, soapy water for 20 seconds.  If unavailable, use hand sanitizer.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Cover coughs and sneezes and immediately dispose of soiled tissues.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily (tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, etc.) </p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and face.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Avoid sharing food and drinks.</p>
</li>

<p>EBF Junior/Senior High families:</p>
<p>We are trying something new in our system.  Below you will see a link to a video message from Mr. Noble.  Please give it a try.</p>
<p> If you have difficulties opening or watching the video, please let us know so we can find an another way that will be more compatible for your viewing. </p>

<p><strong>April 3, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Dear EBF Family, <br>On April 2, 2020, Governor Kim Reynolds announced the extension of school closures statewide through April 30, 2020. This announcement has been expected over the past few days after President Trump’s extension of social distance guidelines on Sunday. </p>
<p>The closure continues to affect all school programming, including before and after-school activities, all athletic and extracurricular practices and competitions, and all weekend events through April 30, 2020. We are aware that this includes our high school prom. At this time, prom is postponed.  </p>
<p>Currently, graduation will remain scheduled for Sunday, May 17th. Our daycare center will also remain closed through April 30, 2020. </p>
<p>District teachers will continue supplementary learning plans for our students. The Iowa Department of Education has provided school districts the option to require online learning that includes grading assignments, or voluntary educational enrichment opportunities. EBF is providing a continuous learning program through voluntary educational enrichment activities and will not be required to make up school hours. </p>
<p>EBF will remain committed to helping our families during the required school closure and will strive to offer the best possible instructional resources and support. We know you are connected with our teachers in a variety of ways and we encourage you to reach out if you have any questions. Please understand that we still believe it is critical to engage children in learning through our supplemental resources. This engagement in learning will hopefully bridge the gap of lost classroom instruction time. </p>
<p>We dearly miss our students and cannot wait to see them back in our buildings. At the same time, we want to ensure the safety of our students, families and all community members. School closures and social distancing are important aspects of returning to normal life in our community as soon as possible. We encourage everyone to do their part by continuing to stay home as much as you can. </p>
<p><br>Sincerely, <br>Dr. Dean Cook, Superintendent</p>

<p><span>Good afternoon,</span></p>
<p><span><br>I hope this email finds you all healthy and relatively sane!  Thank you for all you are doing in the wake of our current school closure.  I have a few things to fill you in on:</span></p>
<p><span><span>-Our next food run will be Monday, March 30 from 4-6pm at the high school.  If you no longer want food OR if you’d like to begin to receive food, please just reply to this email and let me know</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>-I will have new paperwork packets for PS-3rd grade for any of you interested at the elementary on Monday during our food drop.  I’ll be at the front door(bus line) with a table set up for you to grab whatever grade levels you need. Fourth- Sixth grade packets that were mailed had 4 weeks of work included.  I do not have new packets for 4-6th grade.</span></p>
<p><span>-I will accept library books if you’d like to drop those off during this same time frame.  This is optional- but if your house looks like mine, you might want to turn them in before they get lost.  HA!</span></p>
<p><span>-I have canceled many of our previously scheduled field trips.  At this point, should we return to school, we will need to take full advantage of our classroom instructional time that we have lost.  Thanks for understanding. We will still try to get our 5/6th field day and EE fun day in the last week of school.  </span></p>
<p><span>-ISASP testing has been canceled for this school year.  This was a statewide decision. Even if we return to school, we will not be taking our statewide assessments.  </span></p>
<p><span>As always, please let me know what else you need from us.  We want to best support you. I was able to do an online Zoom meeting with the teachers yesterday.  They are anxious to return to our normal routine. WE MISS OUR KIDS! Please take care and keep in touch.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>

<p>Message to Families: School Closing<br>Dear Parents and Community Members:<br>As a school district, we have been closely monitoring the news and best practices regarding the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the direction of Governor Kim Reynolds, she is recommending schools in Iowa must close for four weeks. This closure will take effect tomorrow, on March 16. All extra-curricular activities will be canceled for the next four weeks or until notified.<br>The closure affects all school programming, including before- and after-school activities, all athletic and extracurricular practices and competitions, and all weekend events.<br>District administration will be discussing with teachers and staff the possibilities for e-learning plans for our students. If you have any questions, please contact your child’s building principal. We understand we have some challenges regarding internet access in our community and we are trying to determine a viable solution.<br>We are actively preparing to continue with school lunch services and will communicate when we will resume lunches. More details on school lunch will be provided in the coming days.<br>The coronavirus is thought to be spread via person-to-person contact through contaminated air droplets from coughing and sneezing by an infected person. As with controlling the spread of other viruses, we urge you to speak to your child about the following prevention measures:<br>? Wash your hands regularly, especially after using the restroom and before preparing or consuming food. Using soap and hot water, wash for about 20 seconds. Be sure to also wash your fingertips.<br>? Avoid coughing or sneezing into your hands or in the air. Always try to cough or sneeze into a tissue, then throw the tissue away. If you don’t have a tissue, cough/sneeze into your arm.<br>? As much as you can, avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.<br>The symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the regular seasonal influenza and include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, and coughing. Some people with coronavirus have reported additional symptoms, such as a runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In some situations, the virus can develop into pneumonia.<br>Individuals who need medical care should call their medical providers to report their illness prior to seeking care at a clinic, physician’s office, or hospital.<br>Parents of students exhibiting flu-like symptoms or staff exhibiting flu-like symptoms are asked to contact the County Health Department.<br>Please know that I understand that is will greatly impact our community and my heart is with you. I know the days ahead will be challenging for you and your family. We will do our absolute best to rise to the occasion and try to assist you in finding solutions going forward. May we all lean on each other in the days ahead. We will make it through this rough time. I will provide updates as I receive them to keep everyone updated.<br>Sincerely,<br>Dean Cook<br>Superintendent</p>
