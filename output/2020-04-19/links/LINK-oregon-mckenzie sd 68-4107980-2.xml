<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133634');">Lane County continues to lead the state in recovery of recyclables</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.lanecountyor.gov" target="_blank">Lane Co. Government</a> - 04/22/20 8:00 AM</span><div id="news133634" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>Lane County recycled and composted 53.8 percent of its trash in 2018, one percentage point higher than the recovery rate in 2017, according to the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The recovery rate is a measure of how much of the material residents and businesses throw away gets sent to be recycled into new products, is composted or sent to energy recovery facilities.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The goal for Lane County is 63 percent, set by Lane County and its partners and approved by DEQ. Overall, Lane County residents and businesses sent 1,458 pounds of waste to the landfills per person, while 1,698 pounds of material per person was recycled, composted or converted to energy. Metal recycling and food waste composting both increased – two categories that have the greatest greenhouse gas reduction potential.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“This really highlights our community’s understanding of the importance of recycling, including its benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving water and forests – all things that protect our beautiful environment and what residents value,” Lane County Waste Management Division Manager Jeff Orlandini said. “This number is a reflection of all the efforts of residents and businesses to recover their waste and recycle more.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Lane County’s per capita waste generation was 3,156 pounds, per capita waste generation in Lane has increased 25 percent since 2013 (five-year change) and increased 16 percent since 2008 (ten-year change).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The growth in per capita waste is a concerning reminder that the best way to protect the environment is to be thoughtful consumers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Recycling is good, but we’ve got to do more to keep waste generation down and be thoughtful about our purchases,” said Orlandini. “Those actions alone would result in less energy, water and other natural resources going into making things that get thrown away.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>About the calculation process:</em></p>

<p>Each year, the DEQ compiles data on garbage sent to landfills and materials being recycled. A survey is sent to all collection service providers and private recycling companies. The survey requests detailed information regarding materials collected and marketed for recycling, composting or energy recovery. This survey data is combined and compared with data gathered from landfills and incinerators in order to calculate the recovery rates for each county. </p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 21, 2020</p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.) </strong>Sometimes we forget about all the work that continues to happen behind the scenes in our local communities, despite a crisis.  We would like to send a shout out to all the public works crews, water and waste water treatment plant operators, refuse haulers and utility workers that keep our lights on, our water running, our waste water flowing, our garbage picked up, our streets cleaned, and our road and bridges maintained.  Oakland Mayor, Bette Keehley suggested we mention and send a special thank you to these individuals for the hard work that they do.  “<em>We have a very valuable group of employees that work for our local municipalities, as well as those that work for our county, state and federal government, that we depend on to do their jobs day-in-and-day-out to keep our world functioning, so we can survive this crisis</em>,” commented Keehley.  “<em>You may never see them, or realize all they do, but they are there.  So, if you see them, please take a moment to say thanks!</em>”</p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 21, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  The total number of positives in Douglas County remains at twenty-three.   Of the twenty-three, thirteen have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 728 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Thirteen of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p>The next drive through COVID-19 clinic, led by DPHN, will happen today, Tuesday April 21st, in Roseburg.  At this time, you can only get a COVID-19 test through your healthcare provider. Residents must be identified by their health care provider.  Information has been given to providers and clinics about how to get their patients signed up for the drive-through testing clinics.  If you want to be tested, you must talk to your health care provider.  Tests are currently being processed at the Oregon State Public Health Lab and a growing number of commercial labs, like Quest and LabCorp. There are a few outpatient clinics in Douglas County offering testing at this time. Community health partners are working very hard to make testing available to a wider number of people.  The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 334 people tested so far in the drive through clinics. The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Oregon COVID-19 Case Update</strong></p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority reports new cases once a day on its website at <a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.  The Oregon Health Authority is also releasing the daily situation status report, which is produced jointly with Oregon Office of Emergency Management. It details the overall picture of the COVID-19 outbreak within the state and the response across government agencies. <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/SLdyToaAQ2i1P0EsaL7t_Oregon-COVID-19-SitStat-03-26-2020-FINAL.pdf">Read more here about the daily situation status report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Community Bands Together to Create PPE Supply Chain for Mercy</strong></p>

<p>Hospitals nationwide have found themselves with an acute need for items like N95 masks, gowns, bonnets, gloves and more. Working in concert with Douglas Public Health Network (DPHN), Mercy Foundation has been able to keep up with the demand for PPE as well as homemade masks, to ensure our communities are safe. Local businesses, government agencies and individuals have banded together to create a personal-protective-equipment (PPE) supply chain to support DPHN and the agencies it represents, including Mercy.</p>

<p>Many partners have been instrumental in assisting both Mercy and DPHN, and now the focus is on helping create a supply chain for reusable and more reliable/sustainable PPE.  For reusable gowns, FCC Commercial Furniture has sourced fabric and will be cutting 500 fabric gown pieces, and Mercy Foundation has lined up 15 local seamstresses and tailors to sew the gowns. Oregon Serigraphics and their team of “Sewing Warriors” have made thousands of homemade masks for both Mercy Medical Center’s patients and DPHN, and have added reusable/washable bonnets for Mercy’s clinical staff. Donations of PPE have come from so many generous organizations, including the Roseburg Public School District, Home</p>

<p>Depot, Harbor Freight, local contractors, local business, individuals, veterinarian and dental offices.  There was also a community-wide campaign led by Roseburg Tracker and AHEC raising funds for face shields. All of the donations were split between DPHN and Mercy to use as needed.</p>

<p>Recently, the Roseburg VA has stepped in to help sanitize Mercy’s N95 masks so the normally single-use masks can be worn up to four times. The masks are brought to the VA and disinfected with ultraviolet light in a special process defined by the University of Nebraska. Medical staff mark their masks, and the masks are returned to their same users after being disinfected.</p>

<p><em>“Having adequate PPE has been a concern across the globe, and both state government and supply pipelines have been challenged to consistently meet the needs of hospitals across the U.S.,” </em>said Kathleen Nickel, Mercy’s Director of Communications.<em> “By working with our community partners to create a pipeline of reusable PPE, along with the VA’s partnership to reprocess masks and extend their use from 1 to 4x, we will continue to have the PPE our staff need to care for patients in our community. So, whether a staff member works in surgery, the ER, Family BirthPlace, ICU/PCU or up on the medical or surgical floors, they will have access to the necessary equipment to keep themselves and our patients safe.” </em></p>

<p>Mercy’s Emergency Department and ICU staff switched to reusable gowns, bonnets and other PPE several weeks ago. Patients visiting Mercy’s outpatient clinics are now provided with donated homemade masks, which also helps reduce the use of disposable PPE. Due to these measures and continued community support, Mercy has made a commitment to pay it forward by offering startup PPE back to the local dental practices that stepped up early on to support both Mercy and DPHN, so they can get back to serving their patients.  </p>

<p><strong>Urgent Notice: Wednesday Deadline for SSDI Recipients to Claim Dependent Stimulus Funds</strong></p>

<p>Legal Aid Services is urgently spreading the word that Social Security and Railroad Retirement recipients may lose their dependent stimulus money if they don’t act by Wednesday. People receiving Social Security retirement, survivor or disability benefits (SSDI), Railroad Retirement benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries who didn’t file a tax return in the last two years will automatically receive their $1,200 stimulus payments without having to do anything extra.</p>

<p>However, the IRS issued a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/ssa-rrb-recipients-with-eligible-children-need-to-act-by-wednesday-to-quickly-add-money-to-their-automatic-economic-impact-payment-irs-asks-for-help-in-the-plus-500-push">special alert</a> on Monday that people in those groups who have dependents must take an extra step in order to receive the $500 stimulus payments for eligible children in their households. Those people need to go online and use the IRS’s special <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here">non-filer tool</a> to enter information on their dependents. <strong>This must be done by 9 a.m. Wednesday</strong>, according to the IRS. Those who miss the deadline can have their stimulus amount of $500 per eligible child paid in association with their 2020 tax returns. The IRS notes that SSI and VA beneficiaries have some additional time beyond Wednesday to add their children, since their $1,200 stimulus payments will be made at a later date, but Legal Aid urges them to still act quickly. Legal Aid is available by phone to assist residents Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Call (541) 673-1182 for assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Roseburg Schools Add Dinner Items to “Grab and Go” Meals</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, the Roseburg Public Schools District began adding dinner items to all of its “grab and go” meals, which are currently being served at school sites and via bus routes. Now, the bagged meals will include a breakfast component with fruit and milk; lunch items; and a ready-to-eat dinner component that includes a fruit or vegetable. The bags will contain instructions on how to heat the dinner items. “Grab and go” meals are available for all Roseburg Schools youths ages 0-18. Children picking up their meals at bus stops may take an extra meal for other youths in their home. Adults are allowed to pick up the bagged meals for their children without the child being present. School sites offering meal pickups and bus delivery schedules can be found on the <a href="https://www.roseburg.k12.or.us/community/covid-19/meals-for-students">district’s website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Kids Can Learn About the Weather on Meteorology Site</strong></p>

<p>Is your child fascinated by clouds and storms? Do you suspect you may have a budding young meteorologist at home? Check out <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/accuweather-ready/accuweather-forecasters-school-of-weather/716916">AccuWeather.com</a>, which is offering daily lessons on the weather to help keep kids learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Join us right here every day during the school week as we dive into different weather topics, dispel myths and feature fun experiments,” the site states. Today’s content includes lessons on shelf clouds and lenticular clouds (shaped like spaceships), and weather patterns on other planets.</p>

<p><strong>Spread Some Cheer: Decorate Your Windows</strong></p>

<p>We could all use a little pick-me-up, and you can lift others’ spirits without leaving your house! If your home has street-facing windows, consider placing positive messages in them, or cheerful images like hearts or flowers. You can also put a teddy bear in the window for local kids whose parents have been driving them around on “bear hunts” to count how many they see! Around the globe, residents are livening up their windows to keep their neighbors smiling.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Tips: Outreach Tuesday</strong></p>

<p>We’re all missing seeing our friends and family members as we practice social distancing, and sometimes a phone call or a video chat doesn’t feel the same as just “hanging out.” One way to feel like you’re spending quality time with a loved one is to just keep your phone or video chat on as you go about your day. For instance, call your Mom or a friend and carry your device with you around the house as you fold laundry or put away the dishes so you can keep talking. Chatting informally like this can start to feel like hanging out after a while. Even if there are silences or distractions, you know someone is there with you.</p>

<p><strong>Meteor Shower to Peak Tonight</strong></p>

<p>The annual Lyrid meteor shower has been lighting up the skies, and is expected to peak overnight tonight. The show starts around 10 p.m., but the most “shooting stars” can be seen an hour or two before dawn on Wednesday morning. The Lyrids are rock and dust left behind by comet C/1861 G, also known as Comet Thatcher. The Earth passes through the debris trail once a year. <a name="_Hlk38272665"></a></p>

<p><a name="_Hlk38272665"><strong>Be A Life Savor: Donate Blood</strong></a></p>

<p>Leaving home to donate blood is considered a lifesaving need.  Those who are healthy, feeling well and are eligible to give blood, platelets or convalescent plasma, are urged to participate. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the cancellation of hundreds of Red Cross blood drives, resulting in more than 9,000 fewer blood donations.  Anyone interested in donating must make an appointment by visiting <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org"></a><a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.redcrossblood.org</a>. To save time during your donation, complete your <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/rapidpass">health history questions</a> prior to arriving. Appointments can also be made using the Red Cross Blood Donor App or calling (800) 733-2767.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency health care centers to curb COVID-19 outbreaks at long-term care facilities</strong></p>

<p><strong>April 21, 2020</strong><br><strong>Salem, OR</strong> ? Oregon’s interagency facility support team, led by the Department of Human Services and Oregon Health Authority, has begun deploying two designated COVID-19 emergency health care centers. The centers are intended to:</p>

<p><br>
• Support long-term care facilities in crisis with rising infections;<br>
• Care for residents of facilities with only a few cases of the virus to reduce the chance that others could be exposed; and,<br>
• Provide hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a place to recover before returning to the long-term care facility where they live.</p>

<p><br>
The state has contracted with Pacific Health and Rehabilitation to open an emergency health care center at its 50-bed nursing facility in Tigard, which will be equipped to start accepting patients on Wednesday, April 22, 2020. Laurelhurst Village Rehab in Portland, which has 47 beds, was the first emergency health care center to open.</p>

<p><br>
The additional capacity from the designated centers will be a significant step towards helping to fulfill one of the requirements outlined in Governor Kate Brown’s framework for reopening Oregon, which is that residents of long-term care facilities be protected from COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p><br>
“These centers will provide crucial support,” said Mike McCormick, interim director of the DHS Office of Aging and People with Disabilities. “Making dedicated care centers available reduces the chance that more residents could be exposed.”<br>
27 nursing, assisted living and residential care facilities currently report to DHS that at least one resident or staff member has COVID-19. That represents about four percent of all larger facilities statewide. Seven adult foster homes, or less than one percent statewide, currently report at least one confirmed case.</p>

<p><br>
The state’s interagency facility support team is working closely with Healthcare at Foster Creek. DHS is focused on supporting the facility and has taken additional regulatory action over the weekend to address alleged deficiencies and assist in transferring residents to mitigate against further spread of COVID-19 at the facility.</p>

<h2>Oregon reports 3 new COVID-19 deaths, 46 new COVID-19 cases; data presents snapshot of COVID-19 in Oregon; new tobacco prevention campaign launches; Spanish Facebook page launches with health content</h2>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore.— COVID-19 has claimed three more lives in Oregon, raising the state’s death toll to 78, the Oregon Health Authority reported at 8 a.m. today.</p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority also reported 46 new cases of COVID-19 as of 8 a.m. today bringing the state total to 2,002. The new COVID-19 cases reported today are in the following counties: Clackamas (2), Coos (1), Klamath (2), Linn (1), Marion (10), Multnomah (22), Umatilla (2), Wasco (1), and Washington (7).</p>

<p>After receiving updated residency information, Benton and Yamhill Counties both transferred cases to other Oregon counties yesterday. This led to an overall increase of 46 new cases statewide, and an increase of 48 new cases for the counties.</p>

<p>To see more case and county-level data, Oregon Health updates its website once a day: <a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 76th COVID-19 death is a 47-year-old man in Washington County, who tested positive on March 16 and died on April 17 at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center. He had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 77th COVID-19 death is a 61-year-old woman in Washington County, who tested positive on March 24 and died on April 18 at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center. She had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 78th COVID-19 death is a 65-year-old man in Multnomah County, who tested positive and died on April 20 at Adventist Medical Center. He had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<h2>Weekly Report expands data presented to present a snapshot of COVID-19 in Oregon</h2>

<h2>Oregon Health Authority launches new tobacco prevention campaign</h2>

<p>As evidence mounts that people who smoke and vape are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19, OHA is launching <a href="https://smokefreeoregon.com/oregonians/" target="_blank">a new media campaign and website</a> that focuses on actions real people in Oregon are taking to protect the next generation of youth from nicotine addiction.</p>

<p>The Smokefree Oregon campaign and website, <a href="http://www.smokefreeoregon.com" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://www.smokefreeoregon.com" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.smokefreeoregon.com</a>, are part of Gov. Kate Brown’s <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_19_09.pdf" target="_blank">Executive Order 19-09</a> issued Oct. 4, 2019, which directed state agencies to take strong action to address the vaping public health crisis. It is also relevant in the fight against COVID-19: Initial research shows that people who smoke are twice as likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19 than people who don’t smoke.</p>

<p>Nearly all people who smoke started when they were under 18, underscoring the importance of anti-tobacco media campaigns and other evidence-based prevention programs.</p>

<p>Nicotine addiction among youth is on the rise. Vaping among Oregon 11th-graders increased 80% in just two years, from 13% in 2017 to 23% in 2019, according to the 2019 Oregon Healthy Teens survey. Among Oregon high school students who use e-cigarettes exclusively, the survey also found, nearly 90% use flavored e-cigarette products. OHA’s <a href="https://smokefreeoregon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TARA_StatewideRollup_2019.07.03_Accessible.pdf" target="_blank">2019 Tobacco and Alcohol Retail Assessment Report</a> found that about 20% of tobacco retailers in Oregon display tobacco products within a foot of candy or toys. What’s more, one in five Oregon tobacco retailers illegally sold e-cigarettes to an individual younger than 21 in 2019.</p>

<p>The campaign focuses on revealing tobacco industry marketing to youth and how the industry targets communities that are already stressed or struggling. Widespread evidence shows that tobacco marketing causes youth tobacco use and makes it harder for people who are addicted to nicotine to quit. Smokefree Oregon’s new campaign highlights the role of kid-friendly flavors and intentional tobacco industry advertising at children’s eye level. It also calls out how uneven protections—for example, exempting menthol from the federal flavored cigarette ban—has perpetuated higher rates of tobacco-related disease among people of color.</p>

<p>In the face of relentless tobacco industry marketing, individuals, communities and counties across the state have scored wins to hold the tobacco industry accountable. “It’s crucial, particularly as we battle a respiratory virus that puts tobacco users at risk of severe illness, that we protect the next generation from addiction and lung disease,” says Dean Sidelinger, M.D., M.S.Ed. state health officer and epidemiologist at OHA.</p>

<p>“Local public health departments and tribes have been working tirelessly for years to protect our kids from tobacco addiction, especially communities that have the greatest burden of tobacco-related disease. As we’re seeing play out in the COVID-19 pandemic, some communities are at higher risk, partly because of chronic health conditions caused by tobacco. We need to dig into the drivers of those health disparities, including the role of the tobacco industry.”</p>

<p>On its website, Smokefree Oregon shares examples of how people in Oregon are pushing back on the tobacco industry—like Hood River community member Gerardo Bobadilla, who refused the tobacco industry’s requests to sell vape and cigarette products in his grocery store (Mercado Guadalajara). “I focus on selling people the things they need to put on the table for their families. Tobacco isn’t one of them. I hope I can show other businesses that you can be successful without selling tobacco.”</p>

<p>Ads from the campaign will run on billboards in downtown Portland and Salem, and across the state online and on social media from April 21-June 30, 2020.

<p>Salem, OR—The Oregon Department of Revenue today announced an expansion of the types of tax returns for which filing and payment deadlines have been extended due to COVID-19.<br>
The director of the Department of Revenue has issued <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/dor/Documents/Revenue%20Director%27s%20Order%2020-02.pdf" onclick='_orgov.trackOutboundLink(this, "Document Links", "https://www.oregon.gov/dor/Documents/Revenue%20Director%27s%20Order%2020-02.pdf");return false;' target="_blank">Director’s Order 2020–02</a> exercising her legal authority, during the COVID-19 state of emergency, to order further extensions for 2019 tax year filing and payment due dates for certain affected taxpayers as indicated below. As part of these relief initiatives, the department is also temporarily modifying some of its collection processes for individuals and businesses in Oregon.<br>
For personal income, transit self-employment, estate, partnership, S-Corporation, and corporate excise/income taxpayers and filers:<br>

Revenue Director’s Order 2020–02 also provides a temporary extension of the time to submit written objections or requests for a conference and issue notices as follows:<br>
• The deadline for filing a written objection or request for a conference with the department after issuance of a Notice of Deficiency, Notice of Proposed Refund Adjustment, or Notice of Liability is extended to 90 days after the date on the Notice of Deficiency, Notice of Proposed Refund Adjustment, or Notice of Liability.

<h2>OHA revises testing guidelines to prioritize underserved populations and all frontline workers, allows testing for people without symptoms</h2>

<p>Oregon Health Authority (OHA) on Monday night revised guidelines for COVID-19 testing to prioritize impacted populations and all frontline workers. The guidelines continue to allow healthcare providers to make clinical decisions about their patients.</p>

<p>In addition, if supplies allow, asymptomatic people within the congregate care or group living systems can be considered for testing.</p>

<p>The newly revised guidelines urge clinicians to potentially increase testing for Oregonians who may be at particular risk for contracting COVID-19. These groups include:</p>

<ul>
<li>those living or working in congregate care or group living facilities;</li>
     <li>underserved and marginalized populations, including racial and ethnic minority groups;</li>
     <li>essential frontline workers, including those providing healthcare services and those serving the public, such as grocery store workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le2267.pdf" target="_blank">The new clinical guidelines for testing can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>“As we have done numerous times during the COVID-19 epidemic, we’ve revised our testing guidelines in order to fit the changing shape of the disease outbreak, and to ensure we’re best responding to the current situation,” said Dean Sidelinger, MD, state epidemiologist.</p>

<p>“By focusing clinicians’ attention on testing certain groups – including those most at risk for contracting severe forms of COVID-19 – we are making sure people who need to be tested are getting tested and getting the information and treatment they need to manage COVID-19,” Sidelinger said. “Similarly, increased testing in specific areas will help OHA, other state authorities and partners to understand and manage the epidemic.”</p>

<p>OHA’s testing guidelines were developed with input from local public health authorities, epidemiologists and physicians, taking into account the latest understanding of testing supplies and availability in Oregon. The guidelines also are responsive to the latest data analysis showing the contours of the outbreak in Oregon.</p>

<p>Much of the disease outbreak data are available via OHA’s website – including a weekly data report, daily updates and ongoing epidemic modeling: <a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19</a>. These data show the trends for the outbreak and help to inform statewide and local responses, including the revised guidelines.</p>

<p>“Our system for disease testing and response continues to rest on the judgement of healthcare providers, who are the best equipped to make clinical decisions based on the signs and symptoms of the people who they evaluate,” Sidelinger said. “Like many other states, we are using clinical evidence and disease data in our response to this pandemic. We will continue to move in this fashion, ensuring that we build on our good work in controlling the spread of COVID-19 working together as a state.”</p>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore.—Kelvin Valentino McDuffie, 34, of Supai, Arizona, pleaded guilty today for assaulting an in-custody defendant in the Hatfield Federal Courthouse in Portland.</p>

<p>“The safety of incarcerated persons in the custody of the Department of Justice is a top priority for federal law enforcement. The U.S. Marshals Service moved quickly to bring this case to our office so it could be swiftly prosecuted,” said Billy J. Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon. “Assaults on inmates committed with a sexual motive will continue to be prioritized by our office for prosecution.”</p>

<p>“In this case the victim was subjected to abusive sexual contact without permission. Although her dignity was assaulted, it was not surrendered and I thank the U.S. Attorney and the victim for their steadfast pursuit of justice,” said Russel Burger, U.S. Marshal for the District of Oregon.</p>

<p>According to court documents, on July 26, 2019, Deputy U.S. Marshals escorted McDuffie, an adult female victim, and other male and female inmates into a prisoner elevator inside the federal courthouse. The male and female inmates were separated by a metal chain-link screen and McDuffie was restrained with handcuffs and a belly chain.</p>

<p>As the elevator arrived at a floor, McDuffie reached his fingers through the chain-link screen and struck the victim’s inner thigh and buttocks through her clothing with the intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, and degrade the victim and arouse and gratify his own sexual desire.</p>

<p>McDuffie was in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service after being arrested in the District of Oregon for an alleged violation of the supervised release that had been imposed following a conviction for assaulting a federal officer in the District of Arizona.</p>

<p>On November 21, 2019, a federal grand jury in Portland returned a two-count indictment charging McDuffie with assault and abusive sexual contact. He pleaded guilty today to assault and will be sentenced on July 7, 2020 before U.S. District Court Judge Marco A. Hernandez. The U.S. Attorney’s Office expects to recommend a sentence of one year and one day in federal prison.</p>

<p>This case was investigated by the U.S. Marshals Service and prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney’s Office are committed to enforcing the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). PREA was passed, unanimously, by Congress and signed into law in 2003. PREA required the development and promulgation of “national standards for the detection, prevention, reduction, and punishment of prison rape.” These standards, like the law mandating them, are intended to address a serious public safety, public health, and human rights problem—the incidence of sexual violence in our nation’s confinement facilities.

<p>On 04/20/2020 at about 1:32 pm, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office received a report from residents of Otter Rock that two adult men were disregarding the park closed signage and chain link fencing erected to block the public beach access area due to the Covid-19 closure. The two unidentified subjects were observed climbing over the chain link fence, passing over their surfboards then proceeding down to the beach. </p>

<p>On the same date at about 3:38 pm, Deputy Dunteman observed two adult males matching the earlier description climbing back over the fence from the beach area. The adult males were identified as 20-year-old Max Gause and 19-year-old Konnor Owens both of Cottage Grove, Oregon. It was confirmed with the subjects that they were contacted by a local citizen prior to climbing the fence and were advised that the park was closed and that they would be trespassing if they chose to do so. </p>

<p>The Sheriff's Office has been actively patrolling this area, as well as others, following increased reports of trespassing complaints on both public and private properties as well as people congregating in violation of the Governor's "Stay home, save lives" order and Lincoln County order #3-23-85. The Sheriff's Office has taken a very moderate approach of education first, enforcement second. This has been shared through regular messaging to our citizens and visitors. Where education has had some positive impact on most, this incident was an example of individuals openly disregarding a closed and barricaded area as well as warnings from a nearby resident.</p>

<p>Max Gause and Konnor Owens were both cited into the Lincoln County Circuit Court on the charge of Criminal Trespass in the 2nd Degree. </p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>

</div>
<p>Welcome to the Oregon FBI’s Tech Tuesday segment. This week: building a digital defense when it comes to money mule schemes related to COVID-19.  </p>

<p>Fraudsters are taking advantage of the uncertainty and fear surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic to steal your money, access your personal and financial information, and use you as a money mule. </p>

<p>When criminals obtain money illegally, they have to find a way to move and hide the illicit funds. They scam other people, known as money mules, into moving this illicit money for them either through funds transfers, physical movement of cash, or through various other methods. Money mules are often targeted through online job schemes or dating websites and apps. </p>

<p>Acting as a money mule—allowing others to use your bank account or conducting financial transactions on behalf of others—not only jeopardizes your financial security and compromises your personally identifiable information,but it is also a crime. Protect yourself by refusing to send or receive money on behalf of individuals and businesses for which you are not personally and professionally responsible. The FBI advises you to be on the lookout for the following: </p>

<p>Work-from-home schemes </p>

<p>Watch out for online job postings and emails from individuals promising you easy money for little to no effort. Common red flags that you may be acting as a money mule include: </p>

<ul>
<li>
     <p>The “employer” you communicate with uses web-based services such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Outlook, etc. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>You are asked to receive funds in your personal bank account and then “process” or “transfer” funds via wire transfer, ACH, mail, or money service businesses, such as Western Union or MoneyGram </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>You are asked to open bank accounts in your name for a business </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
     <p>You are told to keep a portion of the money you transfer </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals claiming to be located overseas asking you to send or receive money on their behalf </p>

<p>Watch out for emails, private messages, and phone calls from individuals you do not know who claim to be located abroad and in need of your financial support. Criminals are trying to gain access to U.S. bank accounts in order to move fraud proceeds from you and other victims to their bank accounts. Common fictitious scenarios include: </p>

<ul>
<li>
     <p>Individuals claiming to be U.S. service members stationed overseas asking you to send or receive money on behalf of themselves or a loved one battling COVID-19 </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Individuals claiming to be U.S. citizens working abroad asking you to send or receive money on behalf of themselves or a loved one battling COVID-19 </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
     <p>Individuals claiming to be U.S. citizens quarantined abroad asking you to send or receive money on behalf of themselves or a loved one battling COVID-19 </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Individuals claiming to be in the medical equipment business asking you to send or receive money on their behalf </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Individuals affiliated with a charitable organization asking you to send or receive money on their behalf </p>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for accurate and up-to-date information on COVID-19, the CDC has posted extensive guidance and information that is updated frequently. The best sources for authoritative information on COVID-19 are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.cdc.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.coronavirus.gov." rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.coronavirus.gov.</a> You may also consult your primary care physician for guidance. </p>

<p>If you believe you, or someone you know, has been solicited to be a money mule, please ?<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices" target="_blank">contact your local FBI field office</a>. To report suspicious activity, please visit the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at ?<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">ic3.gov</a>. </p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 20, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)  </strong>The news in the last few days has been focused on reopening America.  We are sure many of you have seen what other areas of the country are doing in response to these efforts.  Here in Douglas County we continue to comply by the orders set forth in the March 23, 2020 <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf">Executive Order #20-12</a>, and subsequent orders since, issued by Oregon’s Governor.  Regardless of what you might have heard, Douglas County has not issued any additional closures or issued closures above those instituted by the State. </p>

<p>Another point of contention is the topic of essential and nonessential workers.  The fact is that the list of closures in Oregon were not issued using an essential or nonessential worker manner.  We feel every job in Oregon is essential.  They are essential in supporting households, families, businesses and our economy.  The State was very clear in what businesses and services were required to be closed and those that could remain open if they could follow the restrictions and six-foot people distancing orders.  <a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/or-stay-home-save-lives">Check out the Stay Home, Save Lives and other helpful guidelines here.</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, the orders to reopen Oregon will come from Governor Kate Brown.  On April 17, 2020, she stated, "This is going to move much slower than any of us want, but that is the only way to protect the health of Oregonians."</p>

<p>In the meantime, rest assured that your Douglas County Board of Commissioners are researching all avenues and advocating to find ways to safely open more businesses and services for our residents. </p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 20, 2020, there is one new case of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  Please note that one of our previous positive cases has been reassigned by the state to a different jurisdiction, their address was out of the area, even though they tested positive in Douglas County. So, with the new case and reassignment of the older positive case, this keeps the total number of positives in Douglas County at twenty-three.   Of the twenty-three, ten have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 710 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Ten of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p>The next drive through COVID-19 clinic, led by DPHN, is scheduled for Tuesday April 21st, in Roseburg.  At this time, you can only get a COVID-19 test through your healthcare provider. Residents must be identified by their health care provider.  Information has been given to providers and clinics about how to get their patients signed up for the drive-through testing clinics.  If you want to be tested, you must talk to your health care provider.  Tests are currently being processed at the Oregon State Public Health Lab and a growing number of commercial labs, like Quest and LabCorp. There are a few outpatient clinics in Douglas County offering testing at this time. Community health partners are working very hard to make testing available to a wider number of people.  The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 334 people tested so far in the drive through clinics. The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Oregon COVID-19 Case Update</strong></p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority reports new cases once a day on its website at <a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.  The Oregon Health Authority is also releasing the daily situation status report, which is produced jointly with Oregon Office of Emergency Management. It details the overall picture of the COVID-19 outbreak within the state and the response across government agencies. <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/SLdyToaAQ2i1P0EsaL7t_Oregon-COVID-19-SitStat-03-26-2020-FINAL.pdf">Read more here about the daily situation status report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Live with Dr. Bob Dannenhoffer </strong></p>

<p>Join us tonight, Monday, April 20, 2020 for the next virtual town hall Q&amp;A with Dr. Bob Dannenhoffer, your Douglas County Public Health Officer at 6:00 pm, hosted by DPHN and found on the DPHN Facebook page.</p>

<p><strong>Commissioner Boice to Donate Blood; More Donors Needed</strong></p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 21, 2020, Douglas County Commissioner Chris Boice will roll up his sleeves to participate in a blood drive co-hosted by the Red Cross and the YMCA of Douglas County. Tuesday’s event is the first of two blood drives hosted by the two organizations in the next week. Both will take place at the YMCA at 1151 Stewart Parkway in Roseburg. The clinics are as follows: <strong>Tuesday, April 21</strong> – 9 am to 2 pm and <strong>Tuesday, April 28</strong> – 10 am to 3:30 pm.</p>

<p><em>“It is important that citizens continue to donate blood,”</em> Commissioner Boice said. <em>“We appreciate the collaborative effort by the Red Cross and the YMCA to keep our local blood supply up during this challenging time. Please join me in supporting this event.” </em></p>

<p>Leaving home to donate blood is considered a lifesaving and essential need. Those who are healthy, feeling well and are eligible to give blood, platelets or convalescent plasma, are urged to participate. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the cancellation of hundreds of Red Cross blood drives, resulting in more than 9,000 fewer blood donations.  “We need you now more than ever,” Red Cross officials said. Anyone interested in donating must make an appointment by visiting <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org"></a><a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.redcrossblood.org</a>. To save time during your donation, complete your <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/rapidpass">health history questions </a>prior to arriving. Appointments can also be made using the Red Cross Blood Donor App or calling (800) 733-2767.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for Making Masks More Comfortable</strong></p>

<p>As residents increasingly wear masks in public, some have found that after a while, the masks start to chafe – especially around the ears. Here are some fun ideas for quick fixes to make wearing masks more comfortable. Make sure your mask-hack designs don’t compromise the effectiveness of your mask. Here are the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC’s guidelines</a> for how to use cloth face coverings effectively:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong> ‘Space buns’</strong> - For those with long hair, go for the Princess Leia look; putting your hair in side buns will give you something to attach the mask bands to other than your ears. Or, you can put your hair in a high bun (or ponytail), and criss-cross the straps across the bun. Even people with short hair can get creative; watch the entertaining video in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125495/Chinese-come-hairstyles-hold-face-masks-protect-ears.html">this article</a> about innovative approaches by folks in China. </li>
     <li>
<strong>Monkeys</strong> - Do you have the game “Monkeys in a Barrel” at home? Use one of the monkeys to secure your band! The monkey rests against the back of your head, one hand holding your right ear band, and one holding your left.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Paperclip </strong>– Similar to the monkey idea; just use a paperclip instead of a monkey.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Buttons on a headband </strong>– Attach buttons to both sides of a headband, and strap the elastic bands to the buttons instead of your ears. Here’s a <a href="https://theseamanmom.com/headband-pattern/">sewing pattern</a> for making such a headband. The author cleverly notes that wearing a headband can also help conceal greys and roots in this time without hair salons.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Add elastic </strong>– Tie an extra length of elastic between the ear bands to connect them, so you can just slip the mask over your head.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like a homemade mask please contact <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/234199917629859">Douglas County Helpers</a> via their Facebook page or email at <a href="mailto:douglascountyhelper&lt;a%20href=" mailto:s rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">s@gmail.com</a>"&gt;<a href="mailto:douglascountyhelpers@gmail.com" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">douglascountyhelpers@gmail.com</a>.The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/658730244919310/">Umpqua Sewing Warriors</a> is also making homemade masks and may reached on their Facebook page. The group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thetimberfallersdaughter/">The Timber Faller’s Daughter</a> is working in Reedsport on this effort. You can also find them on Facebook. If you would like to make your own mask, the pattern that many organizations locally have been using can be found <a href="https://www.deaconess.com/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Oregon National Guard to Distribute PPE to Long-Term Care Facilities</strong></p>

<p>About 395,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) will be distributed to long-term care facilities statewide by the Oregon National Guard, the governor announced today. The equipment distribution supplements existing efforts by the Department of Human Services and Oregon Health Authority to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to residents and staff of these facilities. The PPE includes approximately 177,000 surgical masks, 127,000 gloves, 55,000 N95 masks, 33,000 face shields and 2,500 gowns. Deliveries began on Saturday. “Prioritizing PPE for these facilities will save lives and protect the front-line workers who are putting their health at risk to support Oregon’s seniors and people with disabilities,” said Melissa Unger, executive director of SEIU 503.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Tips: Self-Care Mondays</strong></p>

<p>Daily meditation can help reduce anxiety as we all hunker down at home – but if you’ve never meditated before, where do you start? Meditation can mean many things; some people can attain a meditative state through listening to music, gardening, creating art or other relaxing activities. A daily meditation can be something as simple as sitting quietly for five minutes each day and taking some deep breaths. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-meditate">article</a>, titled “How to Meditate,” offers some pointers on getting started and includes a few links to guided meditations. </p>

<p><strong>Stay Informed with the Accurate Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Oregon Credit Unions and Other Financial Institutions Help 19,000 Businesses Obtain Billions in SBA    Paycheck Protection Program Loans</strong></p>

<h3><em>Huge demand created a backlog in the government system, but credit unions cut through the red tape to help thousands of Oregonians continue to receive paychecks.</em></h3>

<h3>
<em>Tigard, Oregon </em>(April 20, 2020<em>)</em> — Every credit union in the state is leaning in to support two million Oregonians who are credit union members -- consumers who live in communities large and small, rural and urban.</h3>

<p>One example of this service is the benefits thousands of businesses and their employees received because credit union employees were “all in” to navigate the backlog created by huge demand for Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program loans.</p>

<p>Oregon Credit unions and other financial institutions were able to help nearly 19,000 small businesses receive approval for $3.8 billion before the funds were exhausted April 16.  The loans made to small businesses are forgivable and will allow them to continue to pay their staff for up to eight weeks, even if the doors to those businesses are closed to help slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Consider the work of the team at Clackamas Federal Credit Union, which helped 99 businesses obtain more than $8 million in funding.</p>

<p>In the words of Debra Galliano-Nolen, co-owner of the Better Homes and Gardens Realty Partners, “Along with millions of other small business owners, we found ourselves in a very scary and unusual position when the COVID-19 shutdown of our country hit.  We took immediate action when the small business stimulus package was enacted, doing our best to maneuver through the confusion and implementation problems that came with the PPP program.  We reached out to SBA and discovered that Clackamas Federal Credit Union was going to be one of the entities handling these loans.  When we contacted CFCU, we were amazed at how helpful and friendly they were, especially since our business accounts were with a big box bank at the time.”</p>

<p>Clackamas FCU’s team helped Better Homes and Garden Realty Partners to finalize their loan.</p>

<p>“We are thrilled to be able to help our small business members survive and keep their employees paid as we get through this crisis together,” said Aaron Goff, President and CEO of Clackamas Federal Credit Union. “We are a relatively small credit union, but our staff has worked night and day to help as many businesses as possible, and we stand ready to do more when Congress allocates more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program.”</p>

<p>“As a woman owned business of a major real estate brokerage in Clackamas County, we finally feel like we’re part of a banking ’team’, a team of people that will help us with our banking needs, a team that will offer solutions, a team that cares about us.  Bye, bye Big Box Bank, hello CFCU!  We are forever grateful,” added Danielle Bade, who is Galliano-Nolen’s business partner.</p>

<p>In Bend, Mid Oregon Credit Union helped to secure over $5 million in PPP loans which protected 748 jobs in the first week the SBA funds were available. OnPoint Community Credit Union, based in Portland, helped 100 businesses obtain nearly $9 million in SBA funding.</p>

<p>The Northwest Credit Union Association is urging Congress to immediately move forward with plans to provide hundreds of millions of dollars of additional funding for the SBA PPP program.</p>

<p>“We are thrilled to be able to help our small business members survive and keep their employees paid as we get through this crisis together,” said Aaron Goff, President and CEO of Clackamas Federal Credit Union. “We are a relatively small credit union, but our staff has worked night and day to help as many businesses as possible, and we stand ready to do more when Congress allocates more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, credit unions continue to find financial solutions for Oregon families, through such programs as options to skip consumer, auto, and mortgage payments, low-to-no interest emergency loans, and loan modifications to make monthly payments more affordable.</p>

<p>For example, more than 16,000 Main Street consumers who are OnPoint members leveraged their credit union’s offer to skip loan payments, to keep their cash on hand for other emergencies. More than 700 consumers skipped their mortgage payments for the same reason. That’s $1 million these homeowners can keep on hand at a time when they most need it.  Credit unions’ community giving DNA is a strong as ever. Shortly after COVID-19 hit Oregon, the credit union donated $100,000 to Meals on Wheels People, in order to make sure the most vulnerable populations were served warm meals in the safety of their own home. OnPoint’s staff members volunteered their time to make deliveries as well.</p>

<p>“OnPoint’s purpose is to build strong communities by supporting financial growth and well-being, one person at a time. We are proud to build our partnership with Meals on Wheels People to help ensure no one has to worry about their next meal throughout this difficult time,” said OnPoint’s President and CEO, Rob Stuart.</p>

<p>The credit union is on the front lines providing cybersecurity and fraud protection guidance to its members as well, since, unfortunately, scammers find opportunities in times of crisis.  </p>

<p>These are only a few anecdotal examples of the work credit unions and their essential employees are doing to help Oregon come through COVID-19 stronger. As not-for-profit, cooperative financial services providers, credit unions do not pay stockholders on Wall Street. Their number one focus is their members. With all the worries Oregonians are shouldering, they can count on help with their finances. Their credit union has their back.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>                                                                                            &lt;END&gt;</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nwcua.org/" target="_blank">Northwest Credit Union Association</a> is the trade association representing more than 175 not-for-profit, cooperative credit unions in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, and their 7.3  million consumer members. As not-for-profit cooperatives, credit unions look out for their members’ financial well-being. Everyone should open their eyes to a credit union.  For more information, please visit: <a href="https://yourmoneyfurther.com"></a><a href="https://yourmoneyfurther.com" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://yourmoneyfurther.com</a></p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM -</strong><strong> SPECIAL LOCAL UPDATE – NEW COVID-19 CASES</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 20, 2020</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.) </strong>As of 12:00 pm, April 20, 2020, there is one new case of COVID-19 in Douglas County.  Please note that one of our previous positive cases has been reassigned by the state to a different jurisdiction, their address was out of the area, even though they tested positive in Douglas County. So, with the new case and reassignment of the older positive case, this keeps the total number of positives in Douglas County at twenty-three.   Of the twenty-three, ten have recovered.  There have been zero deaths and 710 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 and advising quarantine. Ten of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p>The next drive through COVID-19 clinic, led by DPHN, is scheduled for Tuesday April 21st, in Roseburg.  At this time, you can only get a COVID-19 test through your healthcare provider. Residents must be identified by their health care provider.  Information has been given to providers and clinics about how to get their patients signed up for the drive-through testing clinics.  If you want to be tested, you must talk to your health care provider.  Tests are currently being processed at the Oregon State Public Health Lab and a growing number of commercial labs, like Quest and LabCorp. There are a few outpatient clinics in Douglas County offering testing at this time. Community health partners are working very hard to make testing available to a wider number of people.</p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 334 people tested so far in the drive through clinics. The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133612');">PUC Confirms Regulated Utilities Have Suspended Service Disconnections and Late Fees During COVID-19 Emergency</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="https://www.oregon.gov/puc/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Oregon Public Utility Commission</a> - 04/20/20 11:31 AM</span><div id="news133612" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p><strong>SALEM,</strong> Ore. – The Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC) has confirmed that utilities it regulates across the state have taken steps to ensure that customers have continued access to essential utility services during the COVID-19 health crisis.</p>

<p>The regulated energy utilities that have confirmed discontinuation of service disconnections and late payment fees include Portland General Electric, PacifiCorp, Idaho Power, NW Natural, Avista, and Cascade Natural Gas. Similarly, the state’s two largest landline telecommunications carriers, CenturyLink and Frontier Communications, as well as smaller landline companies, have confirmed these same customer protections are in place. Regulated water utilities, including Avion, Cline Butte, and Running Y have also stepped up to protect their customers during this time.</p>

<p>“The actions taken by these regulated utilities will help ensure continued access to essential utility services without fear of disconnects or penalty charges for families experiencing hardships during this health crisis,” said Megan Decker, PUC Chair.  </p>

<p>Although these efforts help ensure continuation of utility services during this unprecedented time, they do not relieve customers from having to pay their utility bills. Individuals having trouble making utility payments are encouraged to contact their utility service provider directly to learn about bill payment options. For bill payment assistance information, visit <a href="http://www.211info.org"></a><a href="http://www.211info.org" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.211info.org</a>.</p>

<p>The PUC will continue to work with the utilities they regulate to ensure continued access to utility services for Oregonians. If customers receive notification that their utility service will be disconnected for non-payment, or if future bills indicate late fee penalties, please contact the PUC’s Consumer Services office by email at <a href="mailto:puc.consumer&lt;a%20href=" mailto:s rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">s@state.or.us</a>"&gt;<a href="mailto:puc.consumers@state.or.us" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">puc.consumers@state.or.us</a> or call 503-378-6600 or 800-522-2404.</p>

<p>The PUC is charged with regulating the state’s investor-owned utilities. Our mission is to ensure Oregon utility customers have access to safe, reliable, and high quality utility services at just and reasonable rates. The PUC does not regulate the rates of consumer-owned utilities, municipal utilities, or wireless and broadband communications providers.</p>

<p><strong>TILLER, Ore.</strong> - A Tiller man is in jail after he pulled a firearm on deputies attempting to serve court papers Sunday morning. </p>

<p>At approximately 10:53 AM, on Sunday, April 19, 2020, deputies went to a residence in the 2100-block of Devils Knob Road in Tiller to serve court paperwork to 51-year-old Daniel Paul Schrack. When deputies arrived, they made contact with Schrack outside of the residence. Schrack became confrontational and began to retreat into a shop. One deputy gave Schrack orders to stop and then deployed his TASER, which did not have any effect. At the same time, another deputy attempted to detain Schrack at which point he lunged toward the shop door, turned and drew a firearm pointing it at deputies. He did not fire the weapon. </p>

<p>Deputies communicated with Schrack until he surrendered at 12:20 PM. He was taken into custody without further incident and lodged at the Douglas County Jail on the following charges: </p>

<ul>
<li>Interfering with a Police Officer</li>
     <li>Obstructing Governmental or Judicial Administration </li>
     <li>Menacing</li>
     <li>Unlawful Use of a Weapon </li>
     <li>Pointing a Firearm at Another</li>
</ul>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>

<p>PORTLAND—Every April, the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) leads communities across the country in observing National Crime Victims’ Rights Week (NCVRW) to honor crime victims, promote their rights and recognize those who advocate on their behalf. This year’s observance takes place April 19-25, with the theme: <em>Seek Justice | Ensure Victims’ Rights | Inspire Hope</em>.</p>

<p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office joins its federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement partners in taking this opportunity to highlight the importance of providing necessary services at the earliest possible stage of victimization and litigation. Early intervention helps prevent further victimization and encourages victim involvement in the criminal justice system, mitigating the cycle of violence and restoring hope for the future.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>“Protecting the rights and dignity of crime victims is central to our mission of ensuring the fair administration of justice. Crime victims are so much more than statistics—they are real people whose lives have been unfairly and, at times, tragically impacted by crime. The courage they demonstrate every day in courtrooms across the country is inspiring to many in law enforcement including myself,” said Billy J. Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon. “I also want to recognize the bravery and perseverance of victim advocates from all levels of government and in non-profit organizations. They work tirelessly every day to create change and hope for victims in need.”</p>

<p>“While we have made tremendous progress driving down crime and violence across the country, far too many Americans continue to suffer the pain and loss of criminal victimization,” said Katharine T. Sullivan, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Justice Programs, which oversees OVC. “This week, we stand by these survivors and their families, and we pledge our ongoing support to the countless men and women who serve them with such extraordinary skill and compassion.”</p>

<p>“Crime victims deserve to know that they have the encouragement and support of the American people,” said OVC Director Jessica E. Hart. “I hope that citizens throughout the nation will take the opportunity this week to remember all victims of crime and their heroic stories of survival. I encourage everyone to also find meaningful ways to express their appreciation to the many committed and compassionate service providers across the country who work tirelessly supporting these survivors.”</p>

<p>During National Crime Victims’ Rights Week, victim advocacy organizations, community groups and state, local, and tribal agencies traditionally host rallies, candlelight vigils, and other events to raise awareness of victims’ rights and services. This year, many communities are organizing virtual gatherings and online public awareness campaigns.</p>

<p>OVC and the U.S. Attorney’s Office encourages widespread participation in the week’s virtual events and in other victim-related observances throughout the year. For additional information about this year’s National Crime Victims’ Rights Week and how to assist victims in your community, please visit OVC’s website at <a href="http://www.ovc.gov"></a><a href="http://www.ovc.gov" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.ovc.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Justice Department has announced that OVC’s National Crime Victims’ Service Awards Ceremony in Washington, D.C., held annually to honor outstanding individuals and programs that serve victims of crime, has been postponed. To be notified when a new date for this event is announced, please subscribe to OVC’s NCVRW email notifications at <a href="https://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw/subscribe/"></a><a href="https://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw/subscribe/" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw/subscribe/</a>.</p>

<p>If you or someone you know are in immediate danger, please call 911. If you believe you’ve been the target or victim of a crime, please contact your local law enforcement agency or your nearest FBI field office immediately. The FBI Portland Field Office can be reached at (503) 224-4181 or by submitting tips online at <a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">tips.fbi.gov</a>.</p>

<p>For Immediate Release</p>

<p>April 20, 2020</p>

<p>This March, Chess for Success canceled the Oregon State Chess Tournament due to the pandemic. The cancellation was a financial blow to the organization and a disappointment to the community. With the quarantine being the new reality for many of us, Chess for Success is shifting their focus to providing online programming for their kids.</p>

<p>Beginning on Friday, April 10th, closed online tournaments will be held on Lichess.org, an open source chess platform used by players ranging from rookies to masters. This will in no way replace the State Tournament, it’s just for fun. Participants are still being gathered through coaches and parents, with an expectation of at least 20 players per tournament. There will be certificates and gift cards for the top players. Although this is a new direction for Chess for Success, having online chess capabilities will allow participants time to practice and spend time with their chess community, if only virtually.</p>

<p>Chess for Success was also forced to cancel their annual spring Game Changer Luncheon, and are pivoting to an online fundraiser, Game Changer Week 2020. This will be a week-long fundraiser April 20th through the 24th utilizing social media platforms. We will share the stories of our community and invite our supporters to do the same. Follow our social media feeds as we share the impact we have in the lives of students around the state. Chess not only has learning benefits; it also gives kids a place to belong.</p>

<p>Matching funds and raffle prizes including dinner with Diego Valeri of the Portland Timbers, will be available to donors. We need your support now more than ever. Please follow:</p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 19, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.) </strong>Today marks the sixth Sunday since the first positive COVID-19 case was announced in Douglas County.  We have witnessed unprecedented interruptions to every aspect of our daily lives since that day.  Many of us have taken on different roles at home, at work and in our communities.  We have modified our kitchen tables into office spaces, made our couches into learning centers, turned front porches into breakrooms, adapted our garages into home gyms and theaters, and made our backyards into campgrounds.  But many of us have turned our free time into volunteer opportunities helping neighbors and delivering meals to home bound seniors.  The Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, under the direction of the Douglas County Commissioners would like to take a moment to recognize all the unsung daily heroes that have stepped up during this crisis.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thank you doctors, nurses and health care workers for continuing to do your jobs.</li>
     <li>Thank you local leaders for your continued guidance, cooperative efforts and emergency planning.</li>
     <li>Thank you parents, siblings and grandparents for helping fill in for our teachers.</li>
     <li>Thank you educators for reaching out to your students and making online learning possible.</li>
     <li>Thank you neighbors for delivering food and supplies to homebound families.</li>
     <li>Thank you small business owners for finding a way to stay open and provide services.</li>
     <li>Thank you grocery store clerks, restaurant workers and bank tellers for continuing to serve us.</li>
     <li>Thank you business owners for keeping people employed as best as you can.</li>
     <li>Thank you everyone that has donated blood, platelets and convalescent plasma. </li>
     <li>Thank you Douglas County for staying home as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 19, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 reported in Douglas County. The number of positive cases remains at twenty-three total in the county.  Of the twenty-three, ten have recovered and two are currently hospitalized at different hospitals.  There have been zero deaths and 676 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19, and advising quarantine. Ten of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.  </p>

<p>At this time, you can only get a COVID-19 test through your healthcare provider. Residents must be identified by their health care provider.  Information has been given to providers and clinics about how to get their patients signed up for the drive-through testing clinics.  If you want to be tested, you must talk to your health care provider.  Tests are currently being processed at the Oregon State Public Health Lab and a growing number of commercial labs, like Quest and LabCorp. There are a few outpatient clinics in Douglas County offering testing at this time. Community health partners are working very hard to make testing available to a wider number of people.</p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 334 people tested so far in the drive through clinics. The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk37835242"><strong>Daily Tips: Backyard Sunday</strong></a></p>

<p>Need to get out of the house but can’t go far? If you have a backyard and some imagination, there are endless ideas for creative family fun. Have a dress-up picnic, either in fancy clothes or silly outfits. For added twist, have your kids plan the menu and prepare the food. Host a “beach barbecue” – set out your towels, put on those shorts (if it is sunny) or lay out in your bathing suits and grill up a tasty meal. (P.S. Don't forget the sunscreen)</p>

<p>If you have a tent, have a camp out and fall asleep listening to all the backyard sounds, like frogs, crickets and birds (if applicable). Look at the stars and see how many constellations you can identify. Download a stargazing app to check your answers. Check out the best stargazing apps at the link below.   <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesseshanahan/2018/05/09/the-best-free-stargazing-apps-of-2018/#625e19f7185d"></a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesseshanahan/2018/05/09/the-best-free-stargazing-apps-of-2018/#625e19f7185d" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesseshanahan/2018/05/09/the-best-free-stargazing-apps-of-2018/#625e19f7185d</a></p>

<p>Don’t have a backyard? How about planning a kids take over the kitchen night? Pretend your dining room table is a restaurant and have your kids act as servers and chefs – it could be a nice break for you and a fun challenge for the kiddos!  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbOu1EU_UUk"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/mbOu1EU_UUk" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/mbOu1EU_UUk</a></p>

<p><strong>Good News &amp; Laughs With Actor John Krasinski</strong></p>

<p>Looking for some positive news and a few laughs this weekend? Actor John Krasisnki, of “The Office” and “Jack Ryan” fame, has launched a hilarious and uplifting YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOe_y6KKvS3PdIfb9q9pGug">SomeGoodNews</a>. Every Sunday evening, he adds a new episode highlighting stories about people doing good things in the world – with some twists. One of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oilZ1hNZPRM">early episodes</a> featured a 9-year-old girl who was sad that the COVID-19 pandemic had forced her to cancel a trip to see the musical “Hamilton” on Broadway. To make her feel better, Krasinski and his wife, actress Emily Blunt, told her that once Broadway reopens, they’ll fly her in to see the show. Then, they video-conferenced in the cast of “Hamilton” to sing for her live. The look on the little girl’s face was priceless!</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133585');">Why Your Economic Impact Payment May Have Been Delayed</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.nwcua.org/" target="_blank">Northwest Credit Union Assn.</a> - 04/19/20 9:33 AM</span><div id="news133585" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p><em>SeaTac, Washington </em>(April 18, 2020<em>)</em> — When Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act three weeks ago, the bill included some much-needed economic support for Main Street.</p>

<p>For millions of Americans that is coming in the form of Economic Impact Payments of up to $1,200 for qualified individuals and additional dollars for households with children.</p>

<p>The first waves of these payments are being issued to people who have direct deposit information on file with the Internal Revenue Service or Social Security Administration. </p>

<p>Other qualified Americans will receive hard copy checks over the next several months.</p>

<p>While almost $150 billion has already landed in the hands of working families, not all eligible consumers have received their funds.</p>

<p>The delay is caused by an overwhelming volume of payments for the U.S. Treasury to distribute, and the effective dates the Treasury set on the payments. For example, while the Treasury announced the first wave of payments would be deposited into accounts April 13, the effective date set was April 15. The Treasury processed another wave of payments Friday, but the funding won’t likely post to consumers’ accounts this Monday, because the effective date is not until April 22.</p>

<p>The confusion between when payments are issued, vs. when the funds are actually posted to consumers’ accounts is frustrating. But the good news is, the payments are coming.</p>

<p>Consumers expecting Economic Impact Payments should verify the funds are indeed posted to their accounts before they attempt to spend the money.</p>

<p>While financial institutions cannot change the government’s process, credit unions have other services that may help their members who are impacted by COVID-19. If your finances are taking a hit, talk to your credit union about options such as low-to-no interest emergency loans, modifications to your existing loans to make payments more affordable, and options to skip payments for a period of months on consumer, auto, and mortgage loans. Your credit union wants to come out of this with you, stronger than ever.</p>

<p><strong>                                                                                  &lt;END&gt;</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nwcua.org/">Northwest Credit Union Association</a> is the trade association representing more than 175 not-for-profit, cooperative credit unions in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, and their 7.3  million consumer members. As not-for-profit cooperatives, credit unions look out for their members’ financial well-being. Everyone should open their eyes to a credit union.  For more information, please visit:</p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 18, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)</strong> We have been talking about the warmer Spring weather the last few days, which brings up a few other frequent questions we receive.  Questions like; “Are our Douglas County Parks back open?”, and “Why are our boat ramps and boat docks closed?”  First, the Douglas County Parks Department would like the public to know that nothing has changed since the March 23, 2020 Executive Orders # 20-12 were issued from the State of Oregon, prompting your Douglas County Commissioners to enact closures for specific Douglas County Departments. These measures will remain in place until such a date that the orders are lifted by your State or County Officials.  For a copy of the press release outlining the County orders <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/media_room/coronavirus/press_releases/03_March/03-23-20%20%20State%20Executive%20Order%20No%2020-12%20-%20What%20it%20Means%20for%20Douglas%20County%20Update.pdf">click here</a>.   </p>

<p>Our Douglas County operated parks and campgrounds remain closed.  While the closure applies to campsites, restrooms and showers, playgrounds and play structures, picnic tables and picnic areas, gazebos and pavilions and disc golf courses, <strong>County operated boat ramps and boat docks remain open for public use.</strong>  We do encourage boaters and fisherman to comply by the 6-foot people distancing, frequent hand washing and cough covering measures that are currently in place.</p>

<p>We understand that it might be difficult to differentiate between City, County, State and Federally operated parks, so for a complete list of Douglas County operated parks and campgrounds, <a href="http://www.co.douglas.or.us/parks/parktour.asp">click here</a>.  If you do not see a park, boat ramp or campground on our County list, then it is operated by another agency and we have no jurisdiction for the closures.  For, inquiries for all other parks, we are asking residents to contact local city park offices, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, the US Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. </p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 18, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 reported in Douglas County. The number of positive cases remains at twenty-three total in the county.  Of the twenty-three, ten have recovered and two are currently hospitalized at different hospitals.  There have been zero deaths and 667 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19, and advising quarantine. Ten of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.  </p>

<p><strong>Shout out moment! </strong>For the third week in a row our amazing drive through clinic team, led by DPHN was able to conduct three clinics per week, two in Roseburg and one in Reedsport each of those weeks.  That’s is a pretty impressive feat.  The drive through clinic in Roseburg on Friday, April 17, saw 22 people tested, while today, April 18, the Reedsport clinic saw 6 people tested.  At this time, you can only get a COVID-19 test through your healthcare provider. Residents must be identified by their health care provider.  Information has been given to providers and clinics about how to get their patients signed up for the drive-through testing clinics.  If you want to be tested, you must talk to your health care provider.  Tests are currently being processed at the Oregon State Public Health Lab and a growing number of commercial labs, like Quest and LabCorp. There are a few outpatient clinics in Douglas County offering testing at this time. Community health partners are working very hard to make testing available to a wider number of people.</p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 334 people tested so far in the drive through clinics. The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>State Issues Order to Protect Oregonians from Garnishment of CARES Act Recovery Rebate Payments</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday, State Officials issued Executive Order 20-18, preventing creditors or debt collectors from garnishing federal CARES Act recovery rebate payments. The order corrects an oversight in the federal legislation, ensuring that Oregonians can use the funds for their intended purpose: covering the costs of essential needs during the COVID-19 public health crisis.</p>

<p>The order gives Oregonians receiving CARES Act rebates the same protection from garnishment as the recipients of other government payments, such as Social Security, disability, and veterans’ benefits. The protection does not extend to garnishments due to criminal actions requiring restitution or civil judgments based on a criminal conviction. As provided by the CARES Act, past-due child support may still be deducted before rebates are deposited in bank accounts.  For more information log onto the <a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/">Oregon Department of Justice</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Time Capsule Activity for Kids</strong></p>

<p>We’re living through a unique time, and here is a kids’ activity that will both capture this strange experience we’re having and provide an outlet for your child’s creativity. It’s a free download called the “<a href="https://letsembark.ca/time-capsule?fbclid=IwAR2Q8f28EQTRV8xGoHKUNKYdzjYh3b3VmcTK6hKUGQGpHbUwaGauksTOE2M">COVID-19 Time Capsule</a>” that includes a number of writing, coloring and other activities focused on children’s feelings, thoughts and experiences during the pandemic. The download was created by Natalie Long of LONG creations. Her page also includes a Spanish-language version of the kids’ time capsule, as well as a version for adults. “We are all living through history, and something I have said I wanted to do from the beginning is make a keepsake of this moment for us to look back on,” Long said on the website.</p>

<p>On Friday April 17th, at approximately 4:30pm, an Otis resident called the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office to report finding a World War II era hand grenade in the garage of her late father’s house. The complainant told deputies she and her husband were going through old boxes belonging to her now deceased father when they found what appeared to be an intact and live hand grenade.</p>

<p>Deputies responded to the residence and evaluated the device. Deputies confirmed the device was an original World War II era, MKIIA1 fragmentation grenade. The grenade was fully intact and appeared to be packaged in its original container.</p>

<p>Oregon State Police Bomb Squad was called to the scene and they secured the device. Oregon State Police Bomb Squad seized the device and will be conducting a more thorough investigation to determine if the grenade contained the necessary internal components to be deadly.</p>

<p>The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office would like to thank the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad for their assistance.</p>

<p><strong>April 18, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>Oregon reports 2 new COVID-19 deaths, 59 new COVID-19 cases</strong></p>

<p><strong>PORTLAND, Ore. </strong>— COVID-19 has claimed two more lives in Oregon, raising the state’s death toll from 70 to 72, the Oregon Health Authority reported at 8 a.m. today.</p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority also reported 59 new cases of COVID-19 as of 8 a.m. today bringing the state total to 1,844. The new COVID-19 cases reported today are in the following counties: Clackamas (1), Curry (1), Deschutes (2), Jackson (1), Klamath (2), Linn (2), Marion (18), Multnomah (26), Polk (1), Umatilla (2), and Washington (4).</p>

<p>A case originally reported as a Yamhill County case was later determined to be a Polk County case. The total number of new cases in Polk County is 1 to reflect this change. However, the case that moved from Yamhill County to Polk County is not reflected in the total of new cases statewide for today.</p>

<p>To see more case and county-level data, go to the Oregon Health Authority website, which OHA updates once a day: <a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 71st COVID-19 death is a 62-year-old man in Clackamas County, who tested positive on April 2 and died on April 16 at Legacy Mount Hood Medical Center. He had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>Oregon’s 72nd COVID-19 death is an 84-year-old man in Marion County, who tested positive on April 2 and died on April 17 at Salem Hospital. He had underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Testing update</strong></p>

<p>OHA continues to provide COVID-19 testing through the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) while Oregon hospitals continue building their laboratory testing capacity. Several Oregon hospital laboratories and commercial laboratories, such as Quest and LabCorp, provide external testing capacity for the state.</p>

<p>OHA is in the process of updating its testing guidance for providers and for OSPHL to augment testing in support of testing goals, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>Protect health care providers, first responders and critical infrastructure workers.</li>
     <li>Increase access to testing in health care settings to appropriately assess, triage and treat patients.</li>
     <li>Identify and control the spread of disease in congregate care settings.</li>
     <li>Eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Longer term, testing is a key strategy for understanding the transmission of the virus and population prevalence of disease. As of April 17, Oregon’s positive testing result has remained fairly consistent at about 5% of tests performed; as compared to the national average of 17.6%.</p>

<p>OSPHL continues to prioritize its testing to identify and control clusters of disease in congregate care settings, including long-term care and correctional facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Salem, OR – April 17, 2020</strong> – As the State of Oregon, and states across the nation, grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to keep communities safe and informed, it’s more important than ever to recognize 9-1-1 operators in Oregon. </p>

<p>This week is National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week, as established by the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials (APCO).  We acknowledge these devoted professionals who take emergency calls and/or dispatch appropriate police, fire and medical services to the location of the emergency.  </p>

<p>9-1-1 operators are a vital element of a city or county emergency services system. They are professionally-trained in order to meet the demands of crucial work that ensures information is communicated quickly and clearly, and accurately relayed to the appropriate agency. They must also track the information in a computer or other dispatch system, all while remaining calm, courteous and confident to keep the caller at ease. </p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 17, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)</strong> The sunshine is abundant and everyone is anxious to get outside, but we want to remind our residents that the stay home orders from the State of Oregon are still actively in place.  While it appears that things are slowing down, the fact is that the COVID-19 crisis is far from over.  The great work we are all doing in staying home is having an impact on slowing the curve for spread of the virus in our county and our state.  <strong>Please keep up your valuable stay ‘homework’! </strong> We will continue to encourage residents to follow the ‘Stay Home, Save Lives’ guidelines, that includes the please stay home, seek medical care if you are sick, wash your hands frequently, cover your coughs, limit travel to necessary trips and maintain a healthy lifestyle messaging. </p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 17, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 reported in Douglas County. The number of positive cases remains at twenty-three total in the county.  Of the twenty-three, ten have recovered and two are currently hospitalized at different hospitals.  There have been zero deaths and 632 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19, and advising quarantine. Ten of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for</p>

<p>Another drive through COVID-19 clinic, led by DPHN is taking place today, Friday April 17, in Roseburg.  The third drive through clinic is scheduled for Saturday, April 18, in Reedsport.  At this time, you can only get a COVID-19 test through your healthcare provider. Residents must be identified by their health care provider.  Information has been given to providers and clinics about how to get their patients signed up for the drive-through testing clinics.  If you want to be tested, you must talk to your health care provider.  Tests are currently being processed at the Oregon State Public Health Lab and a growing number of commercial labs, like Quest and LabCorp. There are a few outpatient clinics in Douglas County offering testing at this time. Community health partners are working very hard to make testing available to a wider number of people.</p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 306 people tested so far in the drive through clinics. The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Oregon COVID-19 Case Update</strong></p>

<p>Oregon Health Authority reports new cases once a day on its website at <a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus"></a><a href="http://www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.healthoregon.org/coronavirus</a>.  The Oregon Health Authority is also releasing the daily situation status report, which is produced jointly with Oregon Office of Emergency Management. It details the overall picture of the COVID-19 outbreak within the state and the response across government agencies. <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/SLdyToaAQ2i1P0EsaL7t_Oregon-COVID-19-SitStat-03-26-2020-FINAL.pdf">Read more here about the daily situation status report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What is Convalescent Plasma?</strong></p>

<p>There has been some talk about the term, convalescent plasma in the news recently.  There is an effort by the American Red Cross and other blood collection organizations to help hospitals treat COVID-19 patients through convalescent plasma.  The Red Cross has partnered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to collect plasma from patients who have recovered from an infection and have antibodies that might help fight that infection – in this case patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19. Two weeks ago, the Red Cross began collecting and distributing the first convalescent plasma donations to help patients in immediate need. Since distributing these products, two of the patients have since improved significantly and are being weaned off the use of a ventilator. </p>

<p>People will probably have a few questions regarding donor eligibility, and we asked the Red Cross to provide link more information.  You may qualify to donate plasma for coronavirus patients if you meet specific convalescent plasma and regular blood donation eligibility requirements: </p>

<ol>
<li>You are at least 17 years old and weigh 110 lbs. Additional weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger. </li>
     <li>In good health. You generally feel well, even if you're being treated for a chronic condition. </li>
     <li>Have a prior, <strong><em>verified diagnosis </em></strong>of COVID-19, but are now symptom free and fully recovered from COVID-19. </li>
</ol>
<p>Recovered COVID-19 patients who meet the above criteria and would like to participate in the program are encouraged to sign up at <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/plasma-donations-from-recovered-covid-19-patients.html" target="_blank">RedCrossBlood.org/Plasma4Covid</a>. Since the establishment of this site, thousands have registered their interest in helping. The hope is to collected hundreds more donations in the coming weeks to meet urgent nationwide hospital needs.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Scams Are Abundant, BUT You Can Avoid Them</strong></p>

<p>Scammers are using the COVID-19 pandemic to prey on people through fraudulent schemes. Since Jan. 1, Americans have lost $13.4 million to coronavirus-related fraud, according to the FTC.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/21989-top-6-coronavirus-scams-bbb">Top Six COVID-19 Scams</a>, according to the Better Business Bureau:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Phony cures and fake masks</strong> – Scammers send emails or other messages claiming to have protective equipment, a cure or a vaccine the government is supposedly keeping secret. Here are <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/scams/21626-scam-alert-afraid-of-getting-sick-dont-fall-for-a-coronavirus-con">more details</a> about those scams.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Stimulus check scams </strong>– Scammers send out fake economic impact checks and ask consumers to pay fees to get their money earlier than what the IRS has promised. Examples are <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/21774-scam-alert-government-relief-checks-trigger-latest-coronavirus-scam">here</a>. </li>
     <li>
<strong>Phishing scams</strong> – These are attempts to gain access to your computer remotely, or to your personal or your company’s information. The scammer may claim to be offering IT support or may say that your computer has a virus and you must act immediately to fix it. In the past week, Google has intercepted 18 million phishing emails related to COVID-19.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Government impersonation </strong>– People have received <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/21903-scam-alert-mandatory-covid-19-test-texts-are-a-scam">fake emails and text messages</a> claiming the government needs you to take an “online coronavirus test” by clicking on a link. If you click on the link, the scammers can download malware onto your computer and access your personal info.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Employment scams </strong>– These often involve fake job listings – sometimes using real company names - offering work-from-home jobs with good pay. After you’re hired, the scammer may charge you up front for “training” or ask for your bank account number to set up direct deposit. You may be “accidentally” overpaid with a fake check and asked to deposit the check and wire back the difference. Here are <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/21781-coronavirus-creates-perfect-storm-for-scammers">tips for spotting phony job offerings</a>.</li>
     <li>
<strong>Price gouging </strong>– As supplies like hand sanitizer, toilet paper and face masks sell out, scammers hoard these items then resell them online or in person at extremely high prices. Additionally, some <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/21482-scam-alert-preparing-for-coronavirus-that-face-mask-could-be-a-con">online sellers</a> accept payment for things like N95 masks but never deliver the goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scammers contact their victims through email, text, phone calls, social media and other means. Here are some ways to avoid falling victim to a fraudulent scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>View any outreach from a stranger with a critical eye – especially those who ask for your personal information such as social security, bank account number or your computer password.</li>
     <li>If something seems to good to be true, it likely is. </li>
     <li>Don’t click on links in text messages, social media messages or emails from unfamiliar senders.</li>
     <li>Remember that the government will never call to ask for money or your Social Security card, bank account info or credit card numbers.</li>
     <li>Anyone who tells you to pay by Western Union or Money Gram, or by putting money on a gift card, is a scammer. Legitimate businesses will never tell you to pay through those methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scams can be reported to the <a href="file:///C:/Users/tjosborn/Documents/Press%20Releases/COVID-19%20Releases/BBB.org/scamtracker">Better Business Bureau</a> or the <a href="file:///C:/Users/tjosborn/Documents/Press%20Releases/COVID-19%20Releases/ftc.gov/complaint">Federal Trade Commission</a>.

<p><strong>Show Your Support for Military Youth</strong></p>

<p>Purple Up! Day is a worldwide event that is part of the month long celebrations for the Month of the Military Child.  The day aims to show support for Military Youth.  Military Youth are those that currently have a loved one serving in the Armed Forces, especially those that have loved ones deployed overseas.  The event encourages everyone to wear the color purple all day today, Friday, April 17, 2020, as a visual way to show support and thank our military children for their strength and sacrifice.  This message was shared from the Oregon Army National Guard and your Douglas County Commissioners.  For more information on Purple Up and the Month of the Military Child, <a href="https://www.dodea.edu/dodeaCelebrates/Military-Child-Month.cfm">click here</a>. #ORPurpleUp.</p>

Services are available in Spanish.</p>

<p>Legal Aid is spreading the word that adults on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) no longer need to apply with the IRS to get their stimulus checks – but if they have children under 17 in their home, they do need to visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments">IRS website</a> to ensure they get the extra stimulus money for each child. Only veterans who did not file taxes in 2018 or 2019 need to fill out the extra form.</p>

<p>Legal Aid also wants residents to know that <a href="https://finesandfeesjusticecenter.org/content/uploads/2020/04/Oregon-Judicial-Department-Fines-and-Fees.pdf">Oregon State Courts have taken steps</a> to ease the burden of court fines, fees and collections during the COVID-19 pandemic. On a temporary basis, the Courts will no longer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Impose late fees on judgments over 30 days old</li>
     <li>Order driver’s license suspensions for failing to pay a fine within 30 days</li>
     <li>Impose collection fees or refer cases to the Department of Revenue or collections firms</li>
     <li>Issue new garnishments</li>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY TO RECEIVE OVER $7 MILLION IN SRS FUNDING</strong></p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 17, 2020</strong></p>

<p>(Douglas County, Ore.) Your Douglas County Board of Commissioners are pleased to announce that earlier today the U.S. Department of the Interior released more than $28.4 million in payments to 18 counties in western Oregon as a part of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) and Community Self-Determination Act extension. The much needed funding will go directly to these counties to fund vital county services.  Douglas County is the largest recipient of the SRS funding, and is set to receive $7,076,895.82 from the O&amp;C portion of the act. </p>

<p>The extension of the SRS funding is critical to Douglas County residents, as it provides for vital services that otherwise would not be funded.  The SRS funding allocation is the direct result of the work your Douglas County Board of Commissioners do when they engage in face-to-face meetings with our Federal delegates during their visits to Washington D.C.  It is important to understand that without these visits and meetings, and their concerted efforts to educate and discuss O&amp;C timber and other crucial issues with our leaders at the national level, these dollars would not be coming back to our communities. </p>

<p>Commissioner Tim Freeman was quoted in the recent BLM press release stating, “Receipt of the SRS 2019 payment to the O&amp;C Counties is very welcome funding for counties struggling financially with the COVID-19 national emergency.”</p>

<p>The ability of our Douglas County Board of Commissioners to swiftly respond, organize and fund the current COVID-19 emergency crisis is also a by-product of the work they do in Washington D.C., in communicating with our Federal delegates about the vital importance and significance of O&amp;C timber receipts. </p>

<p>The 1937 O&amp;C Act requires 50% of receipts collected from the sale of timber on O&amp;C lands to be distributed among 18 counties in western Oregon. The payments follow a formula established by the June 9, 1916 Chamberlain- Ferris Act, the O&amp;C Act requires timber receipts to be shared with western Oregon counties, and will continue to remain in effect following the expiration of the SRS and Community Self-Determination Act.  The O&amp;C Lands lie in a checkerboard pattern through 18 counties of western Oregon. </p>

<p>Today OHA released an update to its epidemic modeling report, which helps Oregon’s leaders understand the progression and the projections for the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133549');">Beaverton Man Charged in Bank Fraud Scheme Targeting Local Credit Union Members</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-or" target="_blank">U.S. Attorney's Office - District of Oregon</a> - 04/17/20 2:54 PM</span><div id="news133549" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>PORTLAND, Ore.—U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams announced today that a Beaverton, Oregon man has been charged with bank fraud in a scheme involving the impersonation of credit union employees in order to obtain members’ personal financial information.</p>

<p>Winston E. Gray, 30, has been charged by criminal complaint with bank fraud.</p>

<p>According to court documents, on March 30, 2020, a fraud investigator for Rivermark Credit Union in Portland contacted the Portland Police Bureau to report that numerous credit union members had received fraudulent text messages asking them to confirm or deny a recent transaction. When a victim member denied the transaction, they received a phone call from someone purporting to be a credit union employee asking for their debit card number and PIN in order to disable their card.</p>

<p>The personal financial information obtained was used to clone victims’ debit cards and make numerous purchases and ATM withdrawals throughout the Portland metro area. Using a list of fraudulent transactions provided by Rivermark, detectives from Portland Police Bureau and the Beaverton Police Department, with assistance from investigators with OnPoint Credit Union, Bank of America, Unitus Credit Union, and Fred Meyer, obtained video surveillance and photos of the unauthorized transactions from various ATMs and retail establishments.</p>

<p>Surveillance images of the suspect, later alleged to be Gray, were obtained from a Bank of America ATM on NW Cornell Road in Portland. On March 29, 2020, after making a balance inquiry on a victim member’s account, Gray made three consecutive withdrawals of $203 each from the ATM. Gray was later linked to a second fraudulent ATM withdrawal and two fraudulent money order purchases the same day.</p>

<p>As the investigation continued, detectives linked Gray to additional fraudulent transactions between March 30 and April 8, 2020 at locations throughout the Portland area. After reviewing body-worn camera footage from a previous traffic stop, detectives were able to positively identify Gray as the suspect responsible for the fraudulent bank transactions and obtain his home address.</p>

<p>On April 15, 2020, detectives obtained and served state search warrants on Gray’s Beaverton residence, person, and vehicle.</p>

<p>Detectives seized a Bluetooth card writer used to re-encode magnetic strips on credit cards; blank cards with magnetic strips; handwritten instructions on creating stolen identities and committing credit card fraud; multiple stolen credit cards, debit cards, and driver’s licenses; clothing matching those seen in the surveillance footage; more than $10,000 in cash; a 380 caliber handgun; a box of 380 caliber ammunition; and 26 grams of cocaine from Gray’s residence. Other related items were seized from his person and vehicle.</p>

<p>After conducting the searches, Gray was arrested without incident. Gray made his first appearance in federal court today and was ordered detained.</p>

<p>If convicted, Gray faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison, 5 years’ supervised release, and a $1 million fine.</p>

<p>A criminal complaint is only an accusation of a crime, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p>

<p>This case was investigated by the Portland Police Bureau, Beaverton Police Department, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and is being prosecuted by Quinn P. Harrington, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.</p>

<p><strong>BOISE, Idaho – </strong>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) invites the public to participate in a virtual meeting about the recently published Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Draft PEIS) for Fuels Reduction and Rangeland Restoration in the Great Basin. The virtual meeting will provide the public with the opportunity to learn more about the Draft PEIS, discuss it with specialists, ask questions and submit comments on the document.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Draft PEIS, which was <a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-releases-draft-plan-further-efforts-conserve-and-restore-sagebrush-communities">released</a> for a 60-day public comment period on April 3, is intended to further efforts to conserve and restore sagebrush communities within a 223 million-acre area that includes portions of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada and Utah. This plan works in tandem with BLM efforts to construct up to 11,000 miles of fuel breaks in the Great Basin, finalized by the publication of a Notice of Availability of a <a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/interior-improves-strategies-combat-wildfires-across-223-million-acres-great-basin">Record of Decision</a> on Thursday, April 2.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The virtual public meeting is a suite of information and involvement options hosted on a website.  Members of the public may log on to the site, watch a message explaining the project, view photos and maps, and click on any or all of eight information stations addressing aspects of the Draft PEIS. Links will take users to specific sections of the document. The site also offers participants links to two separate email inboxes, one for questions and one for comments. BLM staff members check these inboxes daily and respond to questions as quickly as possible.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The virtual public meeting will be available from April 17 to June 2.  The BLM will use substantive comments on the Draft PEIS as it works to produce a Final PEIS by fall 2020.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>To access the virtual public meeting, use this link:</p>

<p>The Preferred Alternative outlined in the Draft PEIS analyzes a full suite of manual, chemical and mechanical tools, including prescribed fire, seeding and targeted grazing to reduce fuels and conserve and restore sagebrush communities. When finalized, the PEIS will not authorize any specific fuels reduction or rangeland restoration projects. Local offices can use this information to comply with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements when planning and analyzing specific projects, allowing for more rapid implementation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The entire Draft PEIS is available for review on the BLM Land Use Planning and NEPA register at <em> </em><a href="https://go.usa.gov/xdfgV"></a><a href="https://go.usa.gov/xdfgV" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">https://go.usa.gov/xdfgV</a></p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133551');">First Quarter Corporate Activity Tax payments due April 30; Good faith effort will prevent underpayment penalties</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/dor" target="_blank">Oregon Dept. of Revenue</a> - 04/17/20 12:30 PM</span><div id="news133551" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>Salem, OR—First quarter 2020 estimated payments for Oregon’s new Corporate Activity Tax are due by April 30. Taxpayers expecting more than $5,000 of Corporate Activity Tax liability for the calendar year must make estimated payments.<br><br>
The department understands that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact commercial activity, up or down, to an extent that makes it difficult for businesses to estimate their first payment. The department will not assess underpayment penalties to taxpayers making a good faith effort to estimate their first quarter payments for the CAT.<br><br>
Taxpayers may demonstrate good faith effort by using the best information available to them at the time to estimate their payment. Taxpayers should document and retain the information they used to estimate their commercial activity as well as documentation used to show how they calculated their estimated payments. Taxpayers will not be required to submit this information to the department when they file their return or make estimated payments, but should keep the information in their records.<br><br>
Guidance about making CAT quarterly payments can be found on the CAT page of the Department of Revenue <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/DOR/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank">website.</a> Information available by following the Beyond the FAQ link includes answers to the questions:<br>
• How to calculate CAT liability?<br>
• When are estimated payments required?<br>
• How do I pay my estimated taxes?<br><br>
The CAT page also includes links to a video of the presentation made by CAT policy staff during the March CAT update tour, which was cut short by concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, and a PDF file of the PowerPoint presentation used during the tour. Guidance and examples of how to calculate CAT liability can be found in slides 30–38.<br><br>
Additionally, taxpayers can access a PDF of a PowerPoint presentation on “How to make a CAT payment” and links to register and make payments for the CAT through Revenue Online.<br><br>
The CAT webpage also includes a link to the administrative rules for the CAT.<br><br>
The 2019 Legislature created the CAT to boost funding for public schools. The CAT is imposed on businesses for the privilege of doing business in Oregon, including those located inside and outside of Oregon. It’s measured on a business’s commercial activity—the total amount a business realizes from activity in Oregon.<br>
Businesses with taxable commercial activity in excess of $1 million must pay the Corporate Activity Tax. The tax is $250 plus 0.57% of gross receipts greater than $1 million after subtractions.<br><br>
The CAT applies to all business entity types, such as C and S corporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, and other entities. Businesses with more than $750,000 in Oregon commercial activity are required to register for the CAT.<br><br>
Taxpayers can email questions about the CAT to <a href="mailto:cat.help.dor@oregon.gov?subject=RE:%20" onclick="_orgov.trackOutboundLink(this, &quot;Mailto Links&quot;, 'mailto:cat.help.dor@oregon.gov?subject=RE:%20&quot;);return false;"></a><a href="mailto:cat.help.dor@oregon.gov" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">cat.help.dor@oregon.gov</a> or call 503-945-8005.<br><br>

<p>(Salem, Ore.) –Each April, the Oregon Department of Human Services, Child Welfare program honors the important work being done across the state to prevent child abuse. While public coordination for events is not happening in the same way this year, we continue to collaborate with partners for child safety.</p>

<p>Organizations such as Oregon CASA Network, Oregon Child Abuse Solutions, the Oregon Association of Relief Nurseries, and Prevent Child Abuse Oregon are just a handful of our important partners. These organizations create educational opportunities on preventing abuse, provide tangible support for families in need, are child-focused collaborative spaces for children who have experienced abuse, and offer advocacy for children who have entered care. They, and many other partners, such as teachers, healthcare professionals, and all community members play an enormous part in child safety.</p>

<p>"Everyone can play a part in strengthening families," said Rebecca Jones Gaston, DHS Child Welfare Director. "While the Child Welfare agency plays a specific role, I want to honor the work that is being done in the larger system of child safety and encourage all Oregonians to be active in preventing child abuse."</p>

<p>We are a stronger child welfare system because of our partnerships. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the DHS Child Welfare Program continues to operate the 24/7 statewide Child Abuse hotline and respond to reports of abuse and neglect while working with community partners to maintain support to families. Child Welfare has also launched a COVID-19 resources <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/DHS/CHILDREN/Pages/COVID-19.aspx">website</a> to help connect resources and communicate practice changes with partners across the state.</p>

<p>DHS encourages community members to check in with families, when able to do so safely, through phone, email, or by safe distance.</p>

<p>If you suspect a child is being abused, please contact the Child Abuse Hotline at 1-855-503-(SAFE)7233.</p>

<p>GRANTS PASS, Ore. – The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) in partnership with Oregon Community Trees (OCT) has named Grants Pass as Oregon Tree City of the Year for 2020. Each year, ODF and OCT select one of Oregon’s 66 nationally recognized Tree City USA communities statewide to award for that city’s commitment to its urban forest. Last year’s Oregon Tree City of the Year was Corvallis.</p>

<p>OCT President Samantha Wolf said the award is intended to highlight communities delivering best urban forestry practices to their residents. “Grants Pass residents have a better quality of life because they live in a healthy urban forest. This award acknowledges the fine work the City of Grants Pass does to ensure its urban forests continue providing a wide range of social, health and ecological benefits long into the future.”</p>

<p>According to ODF’s Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program Manager Kristin Ramstad, “Grants Pass is a shining example of what a great Tree City USA should be. They have good citizen engagement and excellent planning, including comprehensive goals around tree selection to promote appropriate and diverse choices. This award recognizes their many years of outstanding work to care for and promote a healthy urban forest.”</p>

<p>Specific achievements that contributed to Grants Pass being named Oregon Tree City of the Year include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchase by the City of a 444-acre tract of forested land on Dollar Mountain which will be developed into a nature trail park over the next several years.</li>
     <li>Hiring an urban forester with a Master’s degree from the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies</li>
     <li>Hosting educational tree walks</li>
     <li>Planning to expand City-planting of yard trees from spring only to other times of the year as well</li>
     <li>Having a comprehensive urban forest management plan that includes among many other items:
     <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>A registry of significant trees</li>
          <li>A memorial tree program</li>
          <li>A hazardous-tree removal assistance program</li>
     </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Grants Pass Urban Forester Tony Mecum said, “Grants Pass is rooted not only in its extraordinary natural resources, but also in its community members who steward the precious environment in which we live. For over 32 years, their hard work and foresight to create tree protections in our municipal code, form an urban tree advisory committee, create innovative programs to expand our urban forest, and promote the data-driven evidence that trees are green infrastructure workhorses, are what led us to this moment.”</p>

<p>Tree City USA is an Arbor Day Foundation recognition program. For more than 30 years, Grants Pass has met the Tree City USA program’s four minimum standards by:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintaining a tree board (Parks and Natural Resources Advisory Board)</li>
     <li>a tree ordinance</li>
     <li>a minimum $2 per capita expenditure for tree planting and maintenance</li>
     <li>an annual celebration and proclamation of Arbor Day</li>

<p>April 17, 2020 – Salem, Ore. – The boredom of being cooped up in her Medford home during the recent stay-at-home guidelines, turned into an excellent week after Maria Salas visited her local Minute Mart.</p>

<p>And thanks to that visit, Salas’ boredom soon became excitement as she came home with a Scratch-it worth $50,000.</p>

<p>“We normally play Video Lottery, and when we went to the market we saw the Scratch-its and decided to play,” she said. “The first ticket we played was the winner. I was in shock – I am still in shock.”</p>

<p>Instead of coming home with snacks, Salas Laris said she came home with the down payment for some property.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been able to sleep, I’m so excited,” she said.  “I have a down payment now, it’s great.”</p>

<p>Salas Laris turned the $5 Lucky Lemons Scratch-it she purchased at the Minute Mart in Medford, into $50,000, that’s a lot of lemonade! She then contacted the Oregon Lottery to claim her prize.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133533');">Interior Announces $28.4 Million in Payments to Western Oregon Counties</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.blm.gov/or/index.php" target="_blank">Bureau of Land Management Ore. &amp; Wash.</a> - 04/17/20 8:06 AM</span><div id="news133533" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p><em>Payments support critical county services such as public safety, education, infrastructure and public health.</em></p>

<p><strong>WASHINGTON </strong>- U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt announced today the issuance of more than $28 million to 18 counties in western Oregon as a part of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act extension. The funding will go directly to the counties, supporting investments in education, infrastructure, public safety, health services and other critical expenditures made by these jurisdictions.</p>

<p>"We have a multiple-use and sustained yield mandate to manage public lands for the benefit of the American people,” <strong>said Secretary Bernhardt</strong>. “The Trump Administration is committed to increasing timber production to support economic growth and forest health. This program is one way we are being a good neighbor and supporting Western communities.”</p>

<p>“The Bureau of Land Management administers the Secure Rural Schools Program along with the U.S. Forest Service, and our two agencies manage most of the federal lands in western Oregon. We’re committed to supporting local communities in these 18 counties through this vital program, and by facilitating sustainable development of timber and other natural resources from public lands,” <strong>said William Perry Pendley, BLM Deputy Director for Policy and Programs</strong>.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Land Management manages the SRS program in Oregon and California Railroad Revested Lands, known as the O&amp;C Lands, in concert with the U.S. Forest Service. The O&amp;C Lands lie in a checkerboard pattern through 18 counties of western Oregon. These lands contain more than 2.4 million acres of forests with a diversity of plant and animal species, recreation areas, mining claims, grazing lands, cultural and historical resources, scenic areas, wild and scenic rivers and wilderness. SRS payments are made to over 700 counties across the United States, including the 18 counties containing O&amp;C Lands, according to a formula set by Congress.</p>

<p>“Having helped create the Secure Rural Schools program about two decades ago, and having led the House effort to fund it over the last several sessions of Congress, I’m glad it continues to provide help to our rural counties and our public schools,” <strong>said U.S. Rep. Greg Walden (OR-02)</strong>. “I’ve worked closely with House Leadership and the Trump Administration to ensure that this program is fully funded. Getting these payments out the door is especially important during this pandemic. While this funding is needed, what we really need is to reform forest management policies, so we can reduce the size and severity of wildfires and produce good paying jobs and tax revenues in our forest counties. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and the Trump Administration to achieve that goal.”</p>

<p>“Receipt of the SRS 2019 payment to the O&amp;C and Coos Bay Wagon Road Counties is very welcome funding for counties struggling financially with the COVID-19 national emergency”, <strong>said Douglas County Oregon Commissioner Tim Freeman</strong>. “The SRS payment also highlights the need for predictable local government funding. The Executive Director of the Association of O&amp;C Counties, Rocky McVay, thanks Christine Jeames at the BLM National Operation Center in Denver for the quick turnaround on transferring the SRS 2019 payment to the eligible counties.”</p>

<p>The O&amp;C Lands Act and Coos Bay Wagon Road CBWR Act require 50% of receipts collected from the sale of timber on O&amp;C lands to be distributed among 18 counties in western Oregon. The payments follow a formula established by these laws, both of which authorize timber receipt-based payments to western Oregon counties, and both of which remain in effect following the expiration of the SRS and Community Self-Determination Act.</p>

<p>April 16th, 2020, at approximately 7:00 am, a 911 call was received reporting a serious motor vehicle crash in the 13000 block of Ehlen Road NE, in northern Marion County. It was reported a motorcyclist had collided with a trailer being towed by a semi-tractor and the rider had sustained significant injuries. The motorcyclist did not survive the crash and was pronounced deceased at the scene. The driver of the involved semi-tractor was not injured.</p>

<p>Investigators from the Marion County Sheriff’s Office Traffic Safety Team responded to the scene. Crash scene investigators learned the semi-tractor was traveling eastbound on Ehlen Road NE while pulling two empty flat-bed trailers. The motorcyclist was also traveling eastbound and struck the back of the rear trailer at highway speeds. At the time the crash occurred, the rider was traveling directly toward the sun, which may have limited the visibility of the rider. The driver of the semi-tractor remained on scene and cooperated with investigators. No citations have been issued as a result of the collision.</p>

<p>The identity of the deceased motorcyclist is not being released at this time pending notification of the next of kin.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the Aurora Fire District, Woodburn Ambulance, Marion County Medical Examiner’s Office, Marion County Public Works, Oregon Department of Transportation, and American Medical Response for their assistance.</p>

<p><strong>DOUGLAS COUNTY COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM - DAILY LOCAL UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><strong>JOINT INFORMATION CENTER PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - April 16, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Douglas County, Ore.)  </strong>We have received a lot of questions about hospitalization and what the capacity is for our residents and those around Oregon during the COVID-19 crisis.<strong>  </strong>We hope this information will help with those questions.  Of the 23 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Douglas County, five people have required hospitalization at various hospitals, and only two of those patients remain hospitalized, as of today.  Mercy Medical Center has created a special COVID-19 unit in a separate building that has 30 patient rooms. The unit also includes six ICU beds, which is in addition to Mercy’s 16 regular ICU beds. Due to the relative low number of cases, the wing has yet to be utilized. “It’s available and ready to go if we need it,” hospital spokeswoman Kathleen Nickel said.</p>

<p>"Mercy is prepared to safely care for all patients in our community,” said Mercy’s Chief Medical Officer, Jason Gray, MD. “We know that COVID-19 is serious and that our community is worried, but we've taken numerous steps to protect both our staff and our patients. We are screening all patients and staff, have limited visitors to only a very few and are following the CDCs protocols for ensuring safe care.   We want to encourage patients that have current medical needs that are unrelated to COVID-19 to not delay care, waiting may only make their health issue worse."</p>

<p>To put the numbers into perspective, of the 4.2 million residents in Oregon, there are 307 suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients that are currently being hospitalized, as of today.  According to the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) only about a third of those have been confirmed. But, with the ambiguity with some of the testing, that has number has not been confirmed. They will continue to err on the side of caution, and keep the full 307 hospitalized.  Eighty-nine suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are in ICUs, and 43 are on ventilators.  As far as the availability of beds for COVID-19 patients, OHA confirmed that as of today there are: <strong>8</strong><strong>18 adult ICU beds in Oregon hospitals, 287 of those ICU beds are currently available and 794 available ventilators.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Local COVID-19 Test Results</strong></p>

<p>As of 12:00 pm, April 16, 2020, there are no new cases of COVID-19 reported in Douglas County. The number of positive cases remains at twenty-three total in the county.  Of the twenty-three, ten have recovered and two are currently hospitalized at different hospitals.  There have been zero deaths and 591 negative tests for COVID-19 in the county. Douglas Public Health Network continues their epidemiologic investigations, identifying individuals who may have had close contact with individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19, and advising quarantine. Ten of the individuals who tested positive earlier have now recovered. DPHN defines recovery as an end to all symptoms after a positive test for COVID-19.</p>

<p>The next drive through COVID-19 clinic, led by DPHN is scheduled for Friday April 17th, in Roseburg.  At this time, you can only get a COVID-19 test through your healthcare provider. Residents must be identified by their health care provider.  Information has been given to providers and clinics about how to get their patients signed up for the drive-through testing clinics.  If you want to be tested, you must talk to your health care provider.  Tests are currently being processed at the Oregon State Public Health Lab and a growing number of commercial labs, like Quest and LabCorp. There are a few outpatient clinics in Douglas County offering testing at this time. Community health partners are working very hard to make testing available to a wider number of people.</p>

<p>The first drive thru testing site was piloted in the county on March 17, 2020, there have been 306 people tested so far in the drive through clinics. The drive through clinics are led by DPHN, in conjunction with partner agencies including; Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Board of Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, Douglas County Public Works, local volunteers and local health professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Shout Out to the Coastal Clinic Crew</strong></p>

<p>DPHN, Aviva Health, the Douglas County COVID-19 Response Team, Douglas County Commissioners, Douglas County Sheriff’s Office and Douglas County Public Works teamed up to host the second COVID-19 drive-through testing clinic in Reedsport last Saturday, April 11. Nine individuals were tested and are among 306 Douglas County residents who have been administered tests at the drive through clinics led by DPHN since March 17.  This amazing group of volunteers, County staff and local health professionals are assisting DPHN with testing and other initiatives tied to the region’s COVID-19 emergency response.</p>

<p><em>“It is imperative that we continue to coordinate resources in order to offer testing in multiple areas of our large County,” </em>commented Dr. Bob Dannenhoffer.  <em>Pictured in the attached photo are Douglas County Public Health Officer Dr. Bob Dannenhoffer (right) and Aviva Health Medical Scribe Tori Prawitz-Wiprud, who were on hand Saturday in Reedsport to administer COVID-19 tests.</em></p>

<p><a name="_Hlk37835242"><strong>Reminder for Home Yard Projects: Call 8-1-1 Before Digging</strong></a></p>

<p>Douglas County residents sheltering at home may find themselves with enough time to finally tackle that long-planned yard project. But utility officials are reminding people to make sure they call 8-1-1 to locate underground lines before doing any digging. If you are planning any such projects, state law requires that you call 8-1-1 at least two days in advance.  Calling 8-1-1 will initiate a request for someone to visit your work site to mark the ground above utility lines. This way, you won’t accidentally hit a line while you’re digging,” Avista said on its website.  Common projects that involve digging include installing a mailbox, planting a tree, erecting a fence or installing a sprinkler system.  There are nearly 20 million miles of underground utility lines in the U.S. including gas, water, sewer, cable, telephone and other lines.   </p>

<p><em>“If you don’t know where they are buried before you dig, you are in danger,” </em>Pacific Power officials said.<em> “Even if you are lucky enough not to be harmed, you could be responsible for causing a service outage in your neighborhood – and potentially be responsible for the substantial repair costs.”  </em>The 8-1-1 service is free. Call Before you Dig information can be found <a href="https://call811.com/before-you-dig">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Libraries Closed, But Still Offering Resources</strong></p>

<p>With branches closed due to COVID-19, libraries in Douglas County have been making adjustments to ensure that residents are still reading and learning as they stay home and stay safe. The Roseburg Public Library has implemented weekly drive-up services on Thursdays from 3-6 p.m. so patrons can check out physical materials they’ve placed on hold. Library staff pull the requested items from the shelves, check them out and prepare them for pickup. During pickup, patrons remain in their cars and follow the instructions posted in the parking lot.  To use this option, patrons can log onto their accounts and place holds through the <a href="https://roseburg.biblionix.com/catalog/">library’s catalog</a> using their library card number and password (the default password is the phone number used to register the account). Assistance is available by calling the library at (541) 492-7050 or emailing <a href="mailto:lib&lt;a%20href=" mailto:rary rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">rary@cityofroseburg.org</a>"&gt;<a href="mailto:library@cityofroseburg.org" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink">library@cityofroseburg.org</a>. Returns can be made using the book drop. Due dates have been extended but patrons are encouraged to return books on time.  The library’s digital platforms remain available 24/7. Thousands of e-books and audiobooks are available for readers of all ages through the apps cloudLibrary and OverDrive. More information on digital options is available on the <a href="http://www.roseburgpubliclibrary.org">library’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Douglas County’s other public libraries are also highlighting online resources and fun events to help keep people connected to books. The Lower Umpqua Library in Reedsport is posting “daily literacy activities” on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LowerUmpquaLibrary/">Facebook page</a>, such as “write a poem about spring,” and “cook something you think your favorite book character would like to eat.” The Canyonville Community Library and some other branches have highlighted Dolly Parton’s new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MpwxxTbrBOz1g1X-BynUA?fbclid=IwAR1SgVqFbOU6ZFnjRYXt67MGdaklUSdBW2bWYDt-8q_cG-yJwarZyeeSvDU">YouTube channel</a>, “Goodnight with Dolly,” where the country star reads children’s books.

<p><strong>Daily Tips: Game Night Thursdays</strong></p>

<p>It’s hard not being able to see your friends and family in person. But you can still play games together even if you’re not in the same room. Mad Libs is a fun one for all ages, and logistically easy. Don’t have a Mad Libs at home? Make one up! Other easy games to play virtually are Charades, Bingo or Trivia – you can adjust the rules if needed to make it work over video. If you’re willing to work a little harder, you can even play games like Monopoly, chess or checkers; in those cases, each household will need their own board and will need to keep track of all moves on each board. Find more helpful tips in these articles from <a href="https://parade.com/1025105/stephanieosmanski/zoom-games-for-kids/">Parade.com</a> (kids’ games) and <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/g32098665/best-games-to-play-on-zoom/">Good Housekeeping</a> (adults and kids). </p>

<p><strong>Road and Bridge Closure Updates from ODOT </strong></p>

<p>According to ODOT, <strong>a short section of Scottsburg West Road at the north end of the Scottsburg Bridge will be closed for about two years starting Monday, April 20. </strong>Both the bridge and Oregon 38 (Umpqua Highway) will remain open at all times during construction.  The closure will affect the 200-foot spur of Scottsburg West Road where it meets Oregon 38. Motorists traveling on Scottsburg West Road will be directed to drive under the bridge and use Main Street to reach the highway.  The new Scottsburg Bridge will be constructed just downriver of the old structure, requiring workers to realign this part of Scottsburg West Road.  Prime contractor Hamilton Construction began work on the $39.5 million bridge replacement project in early February. Their first tasks involved removing trees, clearing brush, building access roads, demolishing a condemned house within the work zone, and lowering the roadway under the bridge.  Over the summer, contractors will build a work platform that extends into the Umpqua River. They will also build an approach road to the platform and a retaining wall along Scottsburg West Road.  Construction on the new bridge will likely begin later this year. All work is scheduled to be completed by summer 2022.</p>

<p>Additionally,<strong> U.S. Highway 101 is scheduled to be closed at the Umpqua River Bridge Wednesday night, April 22, from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am.  </strong>The Umpqua River Bridge is located at milepost 211 along US Highway 101, adjacent to Reedsport City Limits.  No detours are available.  The six-hour closure will allow contractors to replace one of two damaged crossbeams of the bridge.  Another nighttime closure of the bridge is tentatively planned for Monday night, April 27.  Emergency service providers will be given priority through the work zone during all closures.</p>

<p><strong>May Primary Election Update: </strong><strong>Voter Registration and Party Affiliation Deadline April 28, 2020</strong></p>

<p>The May 19, 2020 Primary election is a little over a month away and your Douglas County Clerk, Daniel Loomis would like to remind citizens that the deadline for voter registration and party affiliation is April 28, 2020.  Registration cards must be postmarked by this date or submitted online no later than 11:59 pm on April 28, in order to be accepted.  Douglas County citizens can expect to see their mail-in ballots for the May Primary in their mailboxes after April 30, 2020.</p>

<p>You can register to vote or change your party selection any time by updating your registration online at <a href="http://oregonvotes.gov/myvote">oregonvotes.gov/myvote</a> or by filling out a new Oregon Voter Registration Card.  However, if you want to receive a ballot for a major party in the May 19, 2020 Primary Election you must register and make changes to your party selection no later than the deadline of April 28, 2020.</p>

<p>According to the Oregon Secretary of State, we will proceed with our May Primary Elections as planned, because Oregon has a long-established vote-by-mail system, which already complies by the guidelines for no gatherings and physical distancing issued by the State for the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Additionally, for the first time in Oregon, ballots can be returned without a stamp since the state has provided prepaid return postage.  We recommend mailing your ballots early.  Ballots can still be delivered to any official county drop box, if you prefer.</p>

<p>If you have questions or would like more information about Primary Elections and other election processes, please visit the Oregon Secretary of State’s website at <a href="http://oregonvotes.gov/">oregonvotes.gov</a> or call 1.866.673.VOTE.

<p><strong>SALEM, Ore. - </strong> Purple Up! Day is a worldwide event in all communities and all military installations. Show your support for Military Youth (those that have a loved one serving in the Armed Forces) by wearing Purple all day on Friday, April 17th, 2020.</p>

<p>"Many military youth are unnoticed and unrecognized for their incredible strength and resilience due to having a parent serving in the military,” said Hank Bauer, Lead Child and Youth Program Coordinator for the Oregon National Guard. </p>

<p>“They experience deployments of a loved one, extra stress in their household, and other challenges that go along with being part of a military family. They also are more mature than their peers due to increased responsibility in their household and they have a greater respect for service and sacrifice,” he said.” </p>

<p>Purple Up! for Military Youth is an annual campaign during April, to help celebrate the Month of the Military Child. Community members are encouraged to wear purple on April 17th as a visible way to show support and thank military children for their strength and sacrifices. Purple represents all branches of the military as it is a combination of colors with Army ‘green’, Marine ‘red’, and the Coast Guard, Air Force, and Navy ‘blue.’ </p>

<p>This year marks the 34th year that April has been designated as the Month of the Military Child. Oregon alone has 10,000 military connected youth that has a loved one currently serving in a branch of the Armed Forces. Show your support for these youth and families! </p>

<p>"As a teenager who is dealing with a deployment of a parent right now, I know it is extremely hard for me and for my family,” said Lexi, an Oregon teenager from Hillsboro.</p>

<p>“Being a military teen means more responsibility especially when you have younger siblings since they don't understand that a parent might be leaving for a long period of time and for what reason. You have to be strong to support your younger siblings and the rest of the family," she said.</p>

<p>Take a picture of yourself or a group of friends, family, and co-workers and post it on your preferred social media page along with the hashtags: #MOMC, #PurpleUp, and an Oregon specific hashtag: #ORPurpleUp.</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133497');">Lane County Board of Health to consider ordinance requiring hotels to accept government payments during an emergency</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.lanecountyor.gov" target="_blank">Lane Co. Government</a> - 04/16/20 1:00 PM</span><div id="news133497" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>On April 21, 2020, the Lane County Board of Health will consider Ordinance 20-03 in the matter of amending Lane Code Chapter 9 to require Lane County lodgers to accept government vouchers or payments during an emergency. April 21 is the first reading only.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The second reading and public hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. Instructions for participation in the public hearing will be available at <a href="http://www.LaneCountyOR.gov/BoardAgendas"></a><a href="http://www.LaneCountyOR.gov/BoardAgendas" rel="noopener" class="clickableLink" target="_blank">www.LaneCountyOR.gov/BoardAgendas</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The ordinance is being considered because there is an immediate need to provide motel and hotel rooms for unhoused individuals who need to be quarantined while awaiting COVID-19 test results or after a positive COVID-19 test.  Some local hotels and motels have refused to accept these patients through direct County payment or in the form of a voucher for payment.  The Board of Health requests that Lane Code Chapter 9 be revised to establish that no proprietor of a business providing transient lodging may refuse to accept government payment of a reasonable rate for transient lodging. This action will not change any of the other penalties, fines or fees already established. The proposed Lane County Board of Health (BOH) Ordinance will be effective and apply in both incorporated and unincorporated areas.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The potential health implications of not quarantining patients awaiting COVID-19 tests or patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 who are unable to shelter in their homes will result in further spread of COVID-19 resulting in increased burden on healthcare providers and hospitals and will result in more deaths in Lane County.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>The Lane County Board of Health is comprised of the five Lane County commissioners.</em></p>

<p><strong>DHS takes actions to protect residents of Healthcare at Foster Creek </strong></p>

<p><strong>Media availability:</strong></p>

<p>DHS and OHA will hold a media availability to address COVID-19 in long-term care facilities on Thursday, April 16, at 1:50 p.m. To join, <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8802081368819242253">OEM Press Briefing 4/16.</a></p>

<p>Salem, OR ? The Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS), as part of a multi-agency state team, today announced several new actions to further support the care and safety of residents at Healthcare at Foster Creek.</p>

<p>Healthcare at Foster Creek has had 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at its facility and nine of its residents have died from complications related to the virus, according to April 14 data released by the Oregon Health Authority (OHA).</p>

<p>The facility reported to DHS on Wednesday that at least 14 resident deaths could ultimately be attributed to COVID-19.  </p>

<p>While the multi-agency team has been working with the facility since early April, DHS took several stronger steps today as part of a regulatory action, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Securing a management consultant to oversee infection control improvements and assist with operations at the facility.</li>
     <li>Dedicating two DHS registered nurse surveyors to monitor the facility on site and work with the consultant, facility management and staff to ensure residents’ needs are met.</li>
     <li>Requiring the submission of daily staffing reports to the Department</li>
</ul>
<p>“With this additional oversight, the state can better work with facility management to take additional measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 infections. We share a deep concern for the residents and staff impacted by the virus,” said Mike McCormick, interim director of the DHS Office of Aging and People with Disabilities, which licenses long-term care facilities. </p>

<p>24 long-term care facilities in Oregon are currently reporting staff or residents have COVID-19. That’s about four percent of nursing, assisted living and residential care facilities statewide. Six adult foster homes, or less than one percent of these homes statewide, are currently reporting COVID-19 cases. </p>

<p>The state launched a multi-agency support team to assess the needs of long-term care facilities experiencing increased COVID-19 cases, to help them access resources such as staffing and personal protective equipment, and to provide additional oversight if necessary. The team includes DHS, OHA and local public health authorities. As part of this work, the state is contracting with facilities to develop additional capacity to safely treat COVID-19 patients. A 47-bed facility at Laurelhurst Village Rehab in Portland began accepting patients recovering from COVID-19 on Wednesday. </p>

<p>                     A FEW WAYS TO LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE TO COVID-19</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Running Essential Errands</p>

<p>Grocery Shopping, Take-Out, Banking, Getting Gas, and Doctor Visits.</p>

<p>As communities across the United States take steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting close contact, people are facing new challenges and questions about how to meet basic household needs, such as buying groceries and medicine, and completing banking activities. The following information provides advice about how to meet these household needs in a safe and healthy manner.</p>

<p>Find additional information for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Shopping for food and other household essentials</p>

<p>Stay home if sick.</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid shopping if you are sick or have symptoms of COVID-19, which include a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">fever, cough, or shortness of breath</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Order online or use curbside pickup.</p>

<ul>
<li>Order food and other items online for home delivery or curbside pickup (if possible).</li>
     <li>Only visit the grocery store, or other stores selling household essentials, in person when you absolutely need to. This will limit your potential exposure to others and the virus that causes COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>Protect yourself while shopping.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet away from others while shopping and in lines.</li>
     <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">cloth face covering </a>when you have to go out in public.</li>
     <li>When you do have to visit in person, go during hours when fewer people will be there (for example, early morning or late night).</li>
     <li>If you are at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html">higher risk for</a> severe illness, find out if the store has special hours for people at higher risk. If they do, try to shop during those hours. People at higher risk <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html">for severe illness</a> include adults 65 or older and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions.</li>
     <li>
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html">Disinfect</a> the shopping cart, use disinfecting wipes if available.</li>
     <li>Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
     <li>If possible, use touchless payment (pay without touching money, a card, or a keypad). If you must handle money, a card, or use a keypad, use hand sanitizer right after paying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use hand sanitizer when you leave the store. Wash your hands when you get home.</p>

<ul>
<li>After leaving the store, use hand sanitizer. When you get home, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
     <li>At home, follow food safety guidelines: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions#food">clean, separate, cook, chillexternal icon</a>. There is no evidence that food or food packaging has been linked to getting sick from COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accepting deliveries and takeout orders</p>

<p>Limit in-person contact if possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pay online or on the phone when you order (if possible).  Accept deliveries without in-person contact whenever possible. Ask for deliveries to be left in a safe spot outside your house (such as your front porch or lobby), with no person-to-person interaction. Otherwise, stay at least 6 feet away from the delivery person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after accepting deliveries or collecting mail.</p>

<ul>
<li>After receiving your delivery or bringing home your takeout food, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
     <li>After collecting mail from a post office or home mailbox, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Banking</p>

<strong><a href="javascript:toggleLayer('133501');">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Unemployment Benefit Payments Quadruple in Oregon</a></strong><br><span class="cwcReportBy"><a href="http://www.employment.oregon.gov" target="_blank">Oregon Employment Department</a> - 04/16/20 10:18 AM</span><div id="news133501" class="cwcNewsBlock">
<p>During the week of April 5 to April11, the Oregon Employment Department received 53,800 initial claims for unemployment benefits. That’s in addition to a revised total of 243,000 initial claims filed during the prior three weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Helping Oregonians</strong></p>

<p>The Oregon Employment Department continues to prioritize efforts that can get the most benefits to the greatest number of affected Oregonians the fastest. With the first <a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/ui-benefits/CARES">CARES Act</a> payments on April 10, Oregon is among the early states getting an extra $600 per week to those out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the week of March 29 to April 4, the Employment Department paid $23 million in benefits to Oregonians. During the week of April 5 to April 11, that more than quadrupled to $97 million in benefits paid. More benefits measures are on the agency’s <a href="https://govstatus.egov.com/ORUnemployment_COVID19">COVID-19 page</a>.</p>

<p>The Employment Department’s efforts continue with more hiring underway, and programming the unemployment benefits system for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Once ready, the PUA program will allow the self-employed, contract workers, and gig workers not already eligible to receive unemployment benefits for the first time.</p>

<p>The responsiveness of existing agency employees transitioning from other program areas to take claims, efforts to rapidly hire new staff, and launching new programs has resulted in getting much-needed benefits to more Oregonians in difficult times. These results come despite the agency’s reliance on a dated mainframe system to process unemployment benefits. The Employment Department will continue to examine opportunities to improve services to Oregonians, such as waiving the “waiting week” for benefits. As of now, waiving the waiting week requires thousands of hours of programming, and would delay processing record numbers of claims that are getting benefits to Oregonians who need them now.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Claims</strong></p>

<p>The Employment Department has detailed information for 47,700 of the initial claims processed during the week starting April 5. The leisure and hospitality sector, which includes hotels and restaurants, continued to see the greatest number of initial claims for unemployment benefits (12,300). This reflects ongoing impacts of public health and safety measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 15, there have been about 52,900 initial claims filed in the leisure and hospitality sector. Health care and social assistance (25,800) and retail trade (19,700) are other sectors with large totals of initial weekly claims in the past four weeks, but every sector has seen additional claims activity.</p>

<p>Multnomah (10,200), Washington (6,000), and Lane (4,600) also continued to be the counties with the largest number of claims. More initial claims data by industry and area can be found on the QualityInfo.org <a href="https://www.qualityinfo.org/covid-19">COVID-19 page</a>.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>Effective on March 24, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs. The intent of <a href="https://govsite-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jkAULYKcSh6DoDF8wBM0_EO%2020-12.pdf">Executive Order 20-12</a> is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible.<br><br>
               Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, must stay home. All community members should stay home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.<br><br>
               It is okay to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper physical distancing. It is not okay to travel to another community, including the Oregon Coast, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>
               The Executive Order is in effect until terminated by the Governor.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p>We encourage everyone to make use of technology (FaceTime, video calls, and other tools) to stay in touch with loved ones. Isolation can be unhealthy, especially for elderly community members who live alone. Staying in touch can help people remain connected to their loved ones and their communities.</p>

               <p> </p>

               <p><strong>We recommend all residents take everyday precautions</strong> <strong>to prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including while they are at home:</strong></p>

               <ul>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Consider wearing a mask when you leave your home.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.</li>
                    <li>Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations (including the flu vaccine), eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.</li>

<p><strong>CANYONVILLE, Ore. </strong>- A Murphy, Oregon man was safely taken into custody Wednesday afternoon after a several hour standoff with law enforcement. </p>

<p>On April 15, 2020, 9-1-1 dispatchers began receiving multiple reports around 9:48 am, of a man who was firing several rounds outside of a residence in the 400-block of SW Fourth Place. Several law enforcement officers with various agencies responded to the incident. </p>

<p>A citizen notification was made to area residents asking them to stay inside their homes and lock their doors. Interstate 5 was reduced to 1 southbound lane during the incident as well. </p>

<p>The man shooting was identified as 23-year-old Cedar Cascade Higgs. It was reported that Higgs was observed with at least two firearms; a handgun and a rifle. </p>

<p>Members of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office Tactical Response Team and the Crisis Negotiations Team also responded and tried to negotiate with the man. </p>

<p>At approximately 3:45 pm, Higgs surrendered to deputies and was taken into custody without incident. He was lodged at the Douglas County Jail on the following charges: </p>

<p>Unlawful Use of a Weapon<br>
Menacing<br>
Disorderly Conduct II<br>
Reckless Endangering </p>

<p>Detectives, who are continuing to investigate, believe Higgs fired over twenty rounds during the incident. </p>

<p>The Sheriff's Office was assisted by the Oregon State Police, Myrtle Creek Police Department and DINT. </p>
