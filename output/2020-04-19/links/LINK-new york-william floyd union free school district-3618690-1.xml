<h4><strong>April 22, 2020 at 9:00 am (UPDATE):</strong></h4>

<p><b><u>Spring Sports Season Canceled</u></b><br>
Please see the below message from Tom Combs, Executive Director of Section XI of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association:</p>

<p>After much discussion and consideration, the Athletic Council has voted unanimously to cancel the spring sports season for 2020 at all levels. This decision was made in the best interest of the health and safety of all of our student athletes, staffs and communities. The decision was not an easy one to make, however in what the world is experiencing at this time, it is the most prudent decision to make. Thank you and stay safe.</p>

<h4><strong>April 16, 2020 at 1:30 pm (UPDATE):</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Governor Cuomo has extended statewide school closures through May 15, 2020.</strong></p>

<p>Please note that throughout this time, we will continue with our online learning for grades K-12, meals will be available by bus weekdays from 10 am to 12 pm and also available for pick-up at the William Floyd High School south parking lot and the Mastic Firehouse from 10 am to 12 pm on weekdays.</p>

<p>Please continue to check the website for the latest information and continue to stay home as much as you can and practice social distancing when you need to go out. Thank you and please stay safe and well.</p>

<h4><strong>April 16, 2020 at 12:00 pm (UPDATE):</strong></h4>

<p><b><u>Middle School – Third Quarter Grades</u></b><br>
Due to the complex and unprecedented circumstances that we have faced during this academic quarter, both William Floyd Middle School and William Paca Middle School will be issuing a “No Mark” grade for all students for the third quarter. This decision was made with careful consideration of how to properly assess the work of students while taking into account regular school days, snow days, learning packets, and online learning platforms. Please note that this “No Mark” designation does not ignore the efforts of students during this 10-week period. The work completed during the third quarter on all platforms will be calculated as part of students’ fourth-quarter grades. Please continue focusing your best efforts on engaging with your child’s teachers on the Canvas learning platform. If you have any concerns, please reach out to your child’s teachers or administrators. We understand this is a stressful time. If a student is having issues with an assignment, please reach out to their teacher or administrator and explain the circumstances, ask for help or an extension. They will be understanding. We do not want to add any additional stress or burden to anyone at this time, but we are also doing our best to provide balance to ensure our students continue to succeed.<strong> </strong>Thank you and stay safe! </p>

<p>With New York and most of the country currently under "stay at home" orders, now is a great time to take 10 minutes to fill out the 2020 Census! This is vitally important to our community so we can receive the proper federal funding, which has an even deeper meaning now, considering the circumstances of this pandemic. Census data drives decisions on federal funding for school programs, healthcare facilities, emergency services, roads, transportation and much more. You should have received a code in the mail by now. Please note that you can respond online, by phone or by mail! <a href="https://www.wfsd.k12.ny.us/post/~board/posts/post/every-person-counts-2020-census-your-participation-is-important" target="_blank"><u><strong>Click here for more info</strong></u></a>!</p>

<p>During the time that schools are closed, students who typically receive mental health services in school may be limited in their access to the professionals who provide these services. Therefore, district mental health staff would like to make families aware of supports, programs and community-based mental health resources that are available. This information is also helpful to all people during these trying and difficult times. <u><strong><a href="https://www.wfsd.k12.ny.us/post/~board/posts/post/mental-health-resources" target="_blank">Click here for the Mental Health Resources page</a></strong></u>.</p>

<p>As you know, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) health emergency. With the county, state and federal governments placing us in a state of emergency and schools ordered closed by Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone for the next two weeks (March 16-27), the William Floyd School District has put together some questions and answers that might be helpful during this difficult time.</p>

<p><b>Why are schools closed for two weeks?</b><br>
Schools have been closed as a precautionary measure to help prevent community spread of COVID-19. We will continue to use this time to deep clean and sanitize our facilities using a New York State-approved hospital-grade product, 3M Quat Disinfectant, which is effective against a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc. <a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdf">The Center for Biocide Chemistries lists this product as effective at fighting the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)PDF Download</a>. </p>

<p><b>Do you have any cases in the William Floyd School District?</b><br>
We have no confirmed cases at this time.</p>

<p><b>What about students who rely on school meals?</b><br>
We have been working with our food services provider, Aramark, to set up delivery of bagged breakfast and lunch to students in a “grab and go” capacity weekdays (Monday through Friday) for at least the next two weeks. Just pull up in your vehicle, state the name of your child(ren), their school and take the food. Pick up will take place at the following locations beginning Monday, March 16 from 10 am to 12 pm: William Floyd High School south entrance, 240 Mastic Beach Road, Mastic Beach; the Mastic Beach Property Owner’s Association, 31 Neighborhood Road, Mastic Beach; and the Mastic Firehouse, 1080 Mastic Road, Mastic.</p>

<p>The district has also been exploring community food distribution through outside non-profit agencies and will keep you updated on that. The William Floyd Family Center and the local emergency food pantry will be closed at the moment. If anything changes on this, we will let the community know right away.</p>

<p><b>What about school work for these two weeks?</b><br>
The district began preparing grade level packets for K-8 and working on the implementation of online instruction for grades 9-12 for continuity of education.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the elementary school packets were finished in time to go home on Friday except for Nathaniel Woodhull Elementary School. Information on how to pick up packets for Nathaniel Woodhull Elementary School or if a child was absent from any other elementary school on Friday will be forthcoming.</li>
	<li>Middle school packets were not completed in time on Friday to be sent home with students, but they are currently available on each middle school virtual backpack. You are not expected to print these large documents. We will do all that we can to get packets to you. However, if for any reason we are unable to get hard copies in your hands, you can work off of the documents from the virtual backpack. Just number each page and question and follow along on a blank sheet of paper with your answers. Follow these links for middle school virtual backpacks: <b><u><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/wfsd.k12.ny.us/wfms-morning/flyers">William Floyd Middle School</a></u></b> and <b><u><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/wfsd.k12.ny.us/paca-morning/flyers">William Paca Middle School</a></u></b>.</li>
	<li>Resources and information for online instruction for grades 9-12 will be made available in the coming days.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What about spring break will we be required to come to school then?</b><br>
The district, along with every district across Long Island, is awaiting guidance from the Governor Cuomo’s office regarding how to proceed with upcoming school vacation periods as a result of this unprecedented health crisis. Once we have information from the governor, we will share it with the school community expeditiously. We do know that Governor Cuomo has lessened the restrictions on the 180-day attendance requirement. However, we do not yet have guidance on how to proceed with scheduled school vacation periods since a two-week closure has been ordered by Suffolk County. At this point and barring any additional unforeseen closures, we *expect to be open on Monday, April 13, and Friday, May 22 (*subject to change at a moment’s notice). Further information will be communicated as it becomes available.</p>

<p><b>What about UPK and childcare facilities?</b><br>
UPK has been canceled districtwide for the next two weeks, which includes Harmony, Head Start, Colonial Youth and Just Kids. Just Kids special education children who have current individualized education plans (IEPs) that include OT, PT or speech, may call 631-924-0008 to arrange for these therapies at the Just Kids Middle Island site. Just Kids will make every effort to accommodate parent requests. If you currently use Colonial Youth for childcare (at the Little Red Schoolhouse only), please follow up with them directly to inquire if it will still be offered.</p>

<p><b>What about Home Instruction and other-related services?</b><br>
Due to the nature of this emergency closure, all home instruction and services will temporarily stop. Parents, please communicate with your school’s psychologist upon re-opening to schedule a CSE meeting to determine if compensatory services will be required.</p>

<p><b>When will schools re-open?</b><br>
As of this point, please plan for Monday, March 30. However, please note that this is a rapidly evolving situation and this information, while accurate at the moment, could change at a moment’s notice for a variety of reasons. We will continue to follow the lead of the Suffolk County Department of Health, Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone and Governor Cuomo on any health-related closures.</p>

<p><b>Please note that information for the staff will be communicated directly to the staff via district email.</b></p>

<p>Although we still do not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our schools, we have been notified of cases within neighboring communities. So, out of an abundance of caution, all William Floyd schools will be closed for five days beginning on Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 20, in order to continue deep cleaning and sanitizing our facilities. If there are any additional changes, we will notify the school community immediately. The health and safety of our students, staff and community is and will continue to be the number one priority. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this unprecedented health situation.</p>

<h4><strong>March 13, 2020 at 2:35 pm: UPDATE</strong></h4>

<p>William Floyd School District currently does NOT have any cases of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) that includes students and staff. There have been rumors that the Floyd Academy and/or the high school is under lockdown due to COVID-19. Those rumors are NOT true. No buildings are under lockdown for the coronavirus or any other reason. Multiple police cars and an ambulance were at the Floyd Academy to help with a student who fell ill. Click <a href="https://www.wfsd.k12.ny.us/post/~board/posts/post/important-health-information-update">here for the latest health update</a> from Superintendent of Schools Kevin Coster.</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong>March 13, 2020 at 1:20 pm: UPDATE</strong></h4>

<p>In response to the public health situation pertaining to the new strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), we have taken additional precautionary actions as outlined below. Please note that the district does <b>NOT</b> have any cases at this time and the schools are <b>OPEN</b>. With regard to any potential school closures here at William Floyd, we will continue to take a measured approach and follow direction from the Suffolk County Department of Health (SCDOH) and Governor Cuomo, <u><strong><a aria-describedby="audioeye_new_window_message" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/during-novel-coronavirus-briefing-governor-cuomo-announces-new-mass-gatherings-regulations" target="_blank">who is not recommending en masse school closures at this time</a></strong></u>. This is a rapidly evolving situation, but at this time schools will remain open unless there is a confirmed case or we are directed to by SCDOH or the governor.</p>

<p>We have taken the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evening activities (school and community sponsored) have been canceled through April 3, 2020.</li>
	<li>Field trips have been canceled through April 3, 2020.</li>
	<li>Athletic scrimmages and games have been canceled through April 3, 2020.</li>
	<li>We will continue the cleaning and sanitizing procedures throughout the day, at nights and on weekends in all schools and requiring the same on our buses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, in the event that the district does need to close, we have prepared grade level packets for students in grades K-8. We will also be implementing online instruction for grades 9-12 (information on that will be shared if necessary through various electronic means). The grade level packets for K-8 will be coming home in the very near future. <b>Students should not begin this packet unless extended school closure is implemented.</b></p>

<p>Again, we will continue to do all that we can to keep our buildings clean and sanitized, and continue to keep our students, staff and families informed on this rapidly evolving situation. Thank you for your patience as we deal with this public health situation.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Kevin M. Coster<br>
Superintendent of Schools</p>

<h4><strong>March 12, 2020 at 2:00 pm: UPDATE</strong></h4>

<p>I know that there is great concern about the new coronavirus (COVID-19) and I wanted to touch base with you again today to let you know that we do NOT have any cases at this time. Additionally, we have re-assessed and decided to continue the cancellation of evening activities for school and non-school sponsored events in our schools after 6 pm for the week of Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 20, and all of Saturday, March 21. This will allow the deep cleaning and sanitizing to continue without delay. We will re-evaluate this procedure on a week-to-week basis.</p>

<p>You may have heard that some Suffolk County districts are closing schools for 1-2 week periods in a precautionary manner and that will likely continue happening in other districts in the coming days. With regard to any potential school closures here at William Floyd, we will continue to take a measured approach and follow direction from the Suffolk County Department of Health (SCDOH) and Governor Cuomo. This is a rapidly evolving situation, but at this time I do not have any intention of closing schools unless there is a confirmed case or we are directed to by SCDOH or the governor.</p>

<p>However, in the event that we do need to close, we have been making contingency plans. All procedures for these efforts will be communicated if the need arises.</p>

<p>As mentioned in previous updates (available below), we continue to focus on deep cleaning and sanitizing our schools, as well as ensuring our transportation providers are doing the same on buses that transport our children.</p>

<p>Prevention tips, travel advisories and more are also available in the March 11 update below.</p>

<p>Thank you for your efforts and patience during this time as we navigate this unprecedented public health situation.</p>

<p>Kevin M. Coster, Superintendent of Schools</p>

<h4><strong>March 11, 2020 at 1:30 pm: UPDATE</strong></h4>

<p>The William Floyd School District does <strong>NOT</strong> have any cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The district continues to remain in close contact with the Suffolk County Department of Health and receives regular updates on this evolving situation. We wanted to assure you that we are doing all that we can in our power to help stave off the coronavirus in our schools. Below is a summary (which has also been outlined in previous updates listed below).</p>

<ul>
<li>Canceled all evening activities for school and community organizations after 6 pm and this weekend. Will re-assess this on a weekly basis and notify all in a timely manner.</li>
	<li>Clearing buildings by 6 pm provides custodial staff additional time to sanitize and deep clean schools.</li>
	<li>Hired additional custodial staff to assist with this effort.</li>
	<li>The cleaning product is the 3M Quat Disinfectant which is effective against a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria and fungi.<br><u><strong><a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdf">The Center for Biocide ChemistriesPDF Download</a> </strong></u>lists this product as effective at fighting the novel coronavirus.</li>
	<li>Working with district transportation providers to ensure they are disinfecting their buses frequently (buses with visibly sick children are taken out of service temporarily for deep cleaning).</li>
</ul>
<p>The SCMEA rehearsals and concerts scheduled for March 13-15 have been canceled. All-County students are in the process of being notified. This event will not be rescheduled. Additionally, The YMCA canceled the annual Youth &amp; Government conference scheduled for March 13-15 in Albany. No information is available on whether it will be rescheduled.</p>

<p>The district will continue to remain in close contact with the Suffolk County Department of Health, who will contact the district if a confirmed case of COVID-19 emerges. If a confirmed case emerges, we will notify the entire school community immediately and take appropriate measures if necessary, which may necessitate school closures. Please note the district has five unused snow/emergency days that will help alleviate any impact in this worst-case scenario. If a student or staff member shows respiratory symptoms, we will follow our current practices for handling respiratory illnesses, subject to any additional guidance received by the above referenced departments.</p>

<p><b><u>For Those Planning to Travel in the Near Future</u></b><br>
With this rapidly evolving outbreak and the CDC currently restricting travel from certain countries, there remains the very real possibility that travel may be restricted from additional countries at any time resulting in a mandatory quarantine for travelers, whether abroad, on board a cruise ship or even in your own home upon return. Now is the time to make an informed and responsible decision as whether you should go ahead with those plans.</p>

<p><b><u>Prevention tips</u></b><br>
Our schools will continue to focus on the importance of handwashing, covering ones mouth when coughing or sneezing, staying home when sick, etc. Children are encouraged and allowed to wash their hands at any time and are also allowed to bring in personal size hand sanitizer for their own use. Please see additional prevention tips below.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds – (hum the tune of “Happy Birthday” two times). Make sure fingertips are also thoroughly cleaned. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer until hands can be washed properly. Heavily soiled hands should be washed as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home when sick and wait at least 24 hours before returning to school/work after a fever.</li>
	<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then immediately throw the tissue in the trash. If a tissue is not available, cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow. Wash hands.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Electronics should not be sprayed directly.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>March 10, 2020 at 2:00 pm: UPDATE</strong></h4>

<p>There have been rumors that someone in the high school has been infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-2019). Those rumors are <strong>NOT </strong>true. We currently do not have any cases of COVID-19. The Suffolk County Department of Health (SCDOH), the organization in charge of COVID-19 response, testing and determination, has not contacted the district with regard to anyone having the respiratory illness. We also do not have any suspected cases at this time. Rest assured, the district is following all SCDOH procedures as outlined below and will contact the community immediately if anything changes.</p>

<p>SCMEA Music update: The William Floyd School District has informed the Suffolk County Music Educators Association (SCMEA) that we will not be hosting the final two rehearsals this upcoming weekend. This will allow district custodial staff to focus all of their weekend efforts in sanitizing and disinfecting schools. Any additional information regarding SCMEA rehearsals and concerts will come directly from the SCMEA organization in the coming days.</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong>March 9, 2020 at 12:15 pm: UPDATE</strong></h4>

<p>Please see the below message from Kevin M. Coster, Superintendent of Schools:</p>

<p>By now you have undoubtedly seen the multitude of news reports about COVID-19, the novel (new) strain of the coronavirus, a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. This page is to provide the school community with an update about what the district has been doing to try to prevent the spread of viruses within our schools.</p>

<p>The William Floyd School District currently does <b>NOT</b> have any cases of COVID-19. If anything changes in that regard, we will notify the entire school community immediately.</p>

<p><b><u>Plans for This Week</u></b><br>
Out of an abundance of caution, all activities are being canceled for this week in all schools for events that take place after 6 pm – that includes school-sponsored events such as parent-teacher conferences, the Night of 1,000 strings concert, clubs, sports, parent-involvement events, etc., in addition to any programming sponsored by outside community organizations that use our facilities. Additionally, we are currently working with SCMEA to come up with alternative plans for this weekend’s conference. The regular business portion of the Board of Education meeting will still take place as scheduled on Tuesday, March 10 at 7:30 pm in the high school library.</p>

<p>Clearing the buildings by 6 pm will provide our custodial staff with additional time to sanitize and deep clean our schools to prepare for the next day. We are also bringing in additional custodial staff to assist with this effort.</p>

<p>I have assembled a district response team to monitor and assess the situation as it pertains to our schools, students and staff. We are closely monitoring the situation and creating contingency plans for all different possibilities. We will continue to maintain close contact with and follow the lead of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the New York State Department of Health, the Suffolk County Department of Health and the New York State Education Department.</p>

<p>If the district becomes aware that a student or staff member is diagnosed with COVID-19, it will notify the entire school community immediately and take appropriate measures if necessary, such as school closings. Please note the district has five unused snow/emergency days that will help alleviate any impact in this worst-case scenario. If a student or staff member shows respiratory symptoms, we will follow our current practices for handling respiratory illnesses, subject to any additional guidance received by the above referenced departments.</p>

<p>Please know, that, as always, the health and safety of our students and staff is our highest priority, and we will remain vigilant in our efforts to help prevent the spread of this and other illnesses. Below are some of the cleaning procedures we have in place and tips for prevention of the transmission of germs to others and ourselves.</p>

<p><b><u>Cleaning Procedures &amp; Additional Information</u></b><br>
In addition to the thorough cleaning that our custodial staff performs on a regular basis, we have increased the frequency with which they are sanitizing high-traffic spots such as door handles, stairwell railings, bathrooms, chairs, desktops, lunch tables, etc., throughout the school day. Our custodians are using a New York State-approved hospital-grade product, 3M Quat Disinfectant, which is effective against a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc. The Center for Biocide Chemistries lists this product as effective at fighting the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). <u><strong>(<a aria-describedby="audioeye_new_window_message" href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for link and check page 4 of documentPDF Download</a>).</strong></u></p>

<p>Additionally, principals will make periodic announcements in each school about the importance of handwashing in minimizing the spread of respiratory viruses. A <u><strong><a aria-describedby="audioeye_new_window_message" href="https://youtu.be/YBGsoimPXZg" target="_blank">short video will be shown to elementary students</a></strong></u> about the importance of handwashing in staying healthy. We are also working with our transportation providers to ensure they are regularly sanitizing school bus seats and other frequently-touched surfaces on a regular basis.</p>

<p><b><u>Prevention tips</u></b></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds – (hum the tune of “Happy Birthday” two times). Make sure fingertips are also thoroughly cleaned. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer until hands can be washed properly. Heavily soiled hands should be washed as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home when sick and wait at least 24 hours before returning to school/work after a fever.</li>
	<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then immediately throw the tissue in the trash. If a tissue is not available, cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow. Wash hands.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or a family member begin showing symptoms of a respiratory illness and suspect it may be COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider. Before going to your healthcare provider’s office, inform them that a case of COVID-19 is suspected, and follow their advice.</p>

<p>Local health departments will contact schools if a suspected or known COVID-19 case emerges. The district is prepared to work with any affected families.</p>

<p>New York State has established a novel coronavirus hotline, which can provide additional information. Call 1-888-364-3065 with questions or concerns about travel and symptoms. The district will share any new information in a timely manner.</p>

<p>This is also a great time to ensure that your child’s school has the most up-to-date contact information for you and to update emergency contacts. If your contact information has changed, please send in a note to your child’s classroom teacher (grades K-5) or to your school’s main office (grades 6-12).</p>

<p>The William Floyd School District <b>DOES NOT</b> have any cases of COVID-19, and there is no identified risk to the William Floyd School District community at this time.</p>

<p>Additionally, up to this point, there have not been any confirmed cases on Long Island or throughout New York State.</p>

<p>Rest assured, that the district continues to closely monitor this situation and following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the New York State Department of Health, the Suffolk County Department of Health and the New York State Education Department.</p>

<p><b><u>What We Are Doing to Prevent the Spread of Viruses</u></b><br>
The district has infectious disease protocols in place, as it does throughout flu season, and has been taking the steps necessary such as thorough cleansing and disinfecting throughout schools to minimize the spread of viruses. Custodial staff is paying extra attention to frequently touched and other high-traffic surfaces, such as door handles and knobs, stairwell railings, bathrooms, chairs, desktops, lunch tables, etc.</p>

<p><b><u>Prevention (Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention)</u></b><br>
There are a number of steps individuals can take to help minimize the spread of all respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, according to the state Department of Health:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer until soap and water are available. Heavily soiled hands should be washed as soon as possible.</li>

</ul>
<p>If you or a family member begin showing symptoms of a respiratory disease and suspect it may be COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider. Before going to your healthcare provider’s office, inform them that a case of COVID-19 is suspected, and follow their advice.</p>
