Â <br>
During this time, our teachers and staff will continue to provide instruction for at-home learning, and our food service department will continue to provide meals for all students in our district.<br>
Â <br>
Stay home and stay healthy. We are all in this together.<br>

Dear Students and Families:<br>
Â <br>
The New York State Education Department released today guidance on graduation measures and the cancelation of Regents exams. The Baldwinsville CSD will be reviewing these guidance materials carefully over the next few days and making appropriate determinations in the best interest of our students. In the meantime, key points for your consideration are highlighted below:<br>
Â 
<ul>
<li>Students who, during the June 2020 examination period would have taken one or more Regents examinations, will be exempted from passing the assessments in order to be issued a diploma.Â Â </li>
	<li>Students will be granted diploma credit for courses interrupted during COVID-19 closures as long as they have met the standards required for the course.Â </li>
	<li>Science lab minute requirements have been suspended for those courses requiring them.</li>
	<li>Transcripts will not contain scores for any exam students were exempted from taking.</li>
	<li>Assessments aligned to the Next Generation ELA and Math standards have been delayed until the Spring of 2022</li>
</ul>
More information regarding these updates will follow. Read the full releaseÂ <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/news/2020/state-education-department-issues-guidance-graduation-and-course-requirement-changes-due" target="_blank">here.</a><br>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
As you may have learned today, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo extended school closures across the state until April 29, 2020. Gov. Cuomo has made this extension to continue social distancing and help slow the spread of theÂ coronavirusÂ (COVID-19) pandemic.Â  Cuomo also announced greater fines and enforcement by local agencies for any person found violating social distancing orders.Â  As a reminder, this includes district facilities (i.e., all playgrounds, grass fields, tennis courts, running track and turf field).<br>
Â <br>
During this time, our teachers and staff will continue to provide instruction for at-home learning, and our food service department will continue to provide meals for all students in our district.<br>
Â <br>
According to Board of Regents Chancellor Betty Rosa, we were informed the New York State Regents examinations soon will be cancelled. The official announcement and details will be made on Tuesday (April 7, 2020), Rosa said at todayâs Board of Regents Meeting.<br>
Â <br>
We know that our community is eager to get back to school and back to normalcy, but this is a time we need to continue to listen to our local and state leaders -- Stay home and stay healthy!<br>
Â <br>
As always, we are committed to providing additional updates on a regular basis as circumstances warrant. Please check your email and our website,Â www.bville.org, for updates, links, guidance and more.<br>

Â <br>
Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br>
We made it to another Friday! I hope you are staying healthy and positive as we continue to navigate at-home learning together.<br>
Â <br>
I want to take this opportunity to share a few announcements and reminders:<br>
Â <br><strong>Marking period adjustment:</strong><br>
Â <br>
To accommodate for the change in the school calendar regarding spring break, the end date of the third marking period has been adjusted. By doing so, the number of instructional days for each marking period across the school year becomes more proportionate because instruction is now taking place during days that were previously considered as non-instructional. This also applies to due dates of progress reports for students who receive special education services.<br>
Â <br>
The updated dates are as follows:<br>
Â 
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Marking Period 3 began</td>
			<td>Monday, January 27, 2020</td>
		</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Marking Period 3 ends</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Friday, April 10, 2020</strong></td>
		</tr>
<tr>
<td>Parent Portal opens</td>
			<td>Friday, April 17, 2020</td>
		</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marking Period 4 begins</td>
			<td>Monday, April 13, 2020</td>
		</tr>
</tbody></table>
<div style="clear:both;">Â </div>
Â <br>
Due to the uniqueness and challenges of remote learning and the potential social emotional impact of the current pandemic for our students and families, teachers will not penalize students for missing or incomplete work during this time.<br>
Â <br>
Once we know more information about a potential end date of the school closure and/or NYSED expectations regarding end of year testing, we will share updates to the fourth marking period timeline and how final grades will be calculated.<br>
Â <br><strong>Meal distribution changes:</strong><br>
Â <br>
Beginning Monday (April 6, 2020), we will begin serving meals to <strong><u>ALL</u></strong><u> <strong>STUDENTS</strong></u> regardless of their previouslyÂ determined status. The meal distributions are at Ray Middle School and C.W. Baker High School.<br>
Â <br>
Next week, meals will be available on Monday and Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.Â  Students will receive two meals on Monday and three meals on Wednesday. Meal distribution will return to Monday, Wednesday and Friday starting Monday, April 13, 2020. If you plan on picking up meals, we ask that you wait in your vehicle -- Your meals will be brought out to you.<br>
Â <br>
If you would like meals be delivered, you may place a request by dialing 315-638-6097 to make arrangements.<br>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
We have been working around the clock since last Friday when Governor Cuomo announced the extension of our school closure through April 15, 2020 to better understand and clarify what that means for our students and our scheduled April Break.Â <br>
Â <br>
Through inquiry with the Governorâs Office and the New York State Education Department, the Deputy Secretary for Education to Governor Cuomo, has advised that <strong><em>school districts are expected to provide continuity of learning</em></strong> (i.e., continued instruction) and distribution of meals during the closure <strong><em>through April 15, 2020</em></strong>, <em>including during what was previously designated as our Board of Education approved April Break (April 2, 2020 to April 13, 2020) as outlined in the 2019-2020 school calendar</em>.<br>
Â <br>
Therefore, our staff will continue to provide and support students with remote instruction during our scheduled "April Break" given this new guidance -- <strong><em>Students and staff will continue with instruction.</em></strong>Â <br>
Â <br>
While this change may not be popular for students who were hoping to take advantage of a scheduled break from learning, the Governorâs Office believes consistency for our school children with regard to instruction and food is a priority and should continue unabated.<br>
Â <br>
We know everyone has been working diligently for the continued care of our students.Â  We also know that you may be dealing with collective anxiety and fear and, in most cases, were looking forward to some uninterrupted time together, even if unable to get away due to the state of emergency.Â <br>
Â <br>
We are in uncharted territory trying to do what is best during this health crisis.Â  We will all continue to work together to find our way forward.Â  Thank you again for supporting us during this challenging time.Â <br>
Â <br>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
Happy Friday!Â  It is great to see so many Baldwinsville families using social media to stay connected during this time. Thank you for sharing your photos and videos of your children and their artwork, schoolwork and other activities. We sure miss those smiling faces!<br>
Â <br>
We are all anxious to get back to in-person school, work, extra-curricular activities and athletics. As you may have learned today, New York State Governor, Andrew Cuomo, extended school closures across the state until April 15, 2020.Â  Governor Cuomo also mentioned the possibility of longer extensions based on what the data is showing us regarding the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19).Â  I want to assure you that as changes and decisions are made, we will alert you.<br>
Â <br>
For the time being, it is my hope that you take this weekend to relax and recharge. I also hope that you will follow Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahonâs plea to all of us to refrain from social gatherings and practice social distancing.<br>
Â <br>
To end this message, I have chosen to highlight a Twitter (social media) exchange between one of our high school students and their teacher.<br>
Â <br>
Student:Â  <em>âI honestly havenât realized how much I genuinely enjoy coming to school until now.Â  I miss you!â</em><br>
Â <br>
Teacher:Â  <em>âMy dear students!Â  Itâs difficult for all of us.Â  Stay strong!Â  Miss you too.â</em><br>
Â <br>
As this message clearly highlights â <strong><em>We miss your children!</em></strong>Â Â <br>
Â <br>
Thank you again for supporting us during this challenging time.Â <br>
Â <br>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
Today marks one week of at-home learning and I hope your family has settled into a routine. I understand that one of the hardest parts of social distancing for our students is not being able to spend time with their classmates. Nevertheless, I wanted to remind families that the Onondaga County Department of Health and Governor Cuomo have asked our children and teens to avoid playdates or gatherings with friends.<br><br>
I know how difficult this is, I miss my <strong><em>Bee</em></strong> family too. However, it is in our best interest to follow all social distancing guidelines, so we can get back to normal as soon as possible.<br><br>
If you are looking for more ways to keep your children connected, Baldwinsville Central School District teachers have been busy finding creative ways to reach students.<br><br><strong>Here are just a few examples that have been showcased on local news and social media sites: </strong>

<ul>
<li>A group of Reynolds Elementary School teachers started a YouTube channel called âWonât You Bee My Neighborâ: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj8z2tbZ3j7kwI3V2U9iyLg/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj8z2tbZ3j7kwI3V2U9iyLg/</span></a>
</li>
	<li>JoelleÂ Fiorini, a Ray Middle School sixth grade teacher and Kayla Delia, a special education teacher at Elden Elementary School, created a YouTube channel called â2 Sisters Teachingâ: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLxyFA_mV-xaUyS61yWTYeA" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLxyFA_mV-xaUyS61yWTYeA</span></a>
</li>
	<li>Coach Carter, a Ray Middle School substitute physical education teacher, created a YouTube channel for workouts anyone can do at home: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_hQQs_sjH2N9wrmObpu_eg" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_hQQs_sjH2N9wrmObpu_eg</span></a>
</li>
	<li>Reynolds Elementary School art teacher Ms. LaChausse goes live on her Facebook page to teach art lessons:Â  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ms-Ls-Art-Class-102028321442342/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">https://www.facebook.com/Ms-Ls-Art-Class-102028321442342/</span></a>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
We made it to Friday. This week has been challenging for all of us and I wanted to take a moment to say, âthank you!â Your patience and cooperation during these unprecedented times is very appreciated. You have proven that we are all in this together and we will continue to support each other in the coming weeks.<br>
Â <br>
I hope you take time this weekend to relax and spend quality time with your family.<br>
Â <br>
I want to share three quick announcements:
<ol>
<li>Starting Monday (3/23), the meal distribution at Ray Middle School and C.W. Baker High School will be adjusted. If you are picking up a meal, we are asking that you wait in your vehicle. Your meals will be brought out to you.</li>
	<li value="2">If you are using a District device and have technology issues, please email <a href="mailto:helpdesk@bville.org">helpdesk@bville.org</a>
</li>
	<li value="3">All district playgrounds, grass fields, tennis courts, running track and turf field are closed to public use based upon the Governorâs order today.</li>
</ol>
Our website will be updated with new information as it becomes available, and we will share highlights from teachers and parents on our social media pages, but I will be decreasing the number of messages I send out to you. I do not want to overwhelm you with daily messages on top of the communication you are already receiving from your childâs teacher(s). As always, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.<br>
Â <br>
Thank you and be well!<br>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
We hope you are settling in with all the changes weâve seen this week in our District and in our community. Our teachers have connected with your student, and our hope is your family is easing into a new routine of continued learning. Please know it is not our expectation that you become teachers in homeschooling your children. Rather, that our teachers are providing the necessary instruction both online and offline to keep students engaged in learning.<br>
Parents and guardians have a role in supporting learning when it occurs in the classroom as well as when it occurs virtually.<br>
Â <br>
Here are some tips for you:
<ul>
<li>Assist your student with creating a comfortable learning environment and the establishment of a regular academic routine</li>
	<li>Provide materials and tools necessary for learning to occur (paper, pencils, calculator, devices, etc.)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </li>
	<li>Establish regular communication with the classroom teacher to check in with your studentâs progress.</li>
	<li>Have conversations with your student on his or her progress</li>
</ul>
Baldwinsville students have a responsibility to attend to their academic studies on a regular basis during an extended closing of school buildings.<br>
Â <br><strong>Here are some tips for students:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Students will follow accepted netiquette procedures when communicating online with teachers and peers</li>
	<li>Students should establish a learning space and daily academic schedule (in conjunction with their teachers)</li>
	<li>Students should communicate their learning needs with their teachers and participate in assessment opportunities to determine progress (online quizzes, etc.)</li>
	<li>Students should check their school-based Gmail during the normal school hours and respond when necessary</li>
</ul>
We are committed to providing additional updates on a regular basis as circumstances warrant. Please check your email and our website,Â www.bville.org, for updates, links, guidance and more.<br><br>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
As we settle in with the reality that our schools have suspended all in-person sessions, we wanted to check in with you and let you know that our teachers and staff are here to support you and your family.<br><br>
Here are some important updates:<br><br><strong>Continued Learning:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Today begins our first day of continued learning at home. We appreciate your support when assisting your child with creating a comfortable learning environment and the establishment of a regular academic routine.</li>
	<li>Our teachers have been hard at work making adjustments to deliver instructional content at home and will be in contact with you regularly. We understand that instruction will be happening through a variety of means, by incorporating the use of technology and/or alternate resources. It is important that during this extended closure, students remain engaged in their learning.</li>
	<li>Please engage in regular communication with each teacher, and ensure that your child does as well. If you are unable to access any of the resources provided, please let your teacher know. Each building has established a process for signing out technology devices or instructional materials. If you have questions, you can reach out to your child's teacher or main office.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Social-Emotional Well-Being:</strong>

<ul>
<li>When parents and caregivers act calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their children. The CDC has providedÂ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html" target="_blank">resources for managing anxiety and stress</a>Â for all ages, including how to best support your child.</li>
	<li>Take time to answer questions and share facts that your child or teen can understand. Reassure your child or teen that they are safe, and let them know it is OK if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you. Try to keep up with regular routines, and create a schedule for learning activities, as well as relaxing or fun activities. Be a role model; take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well. Connect with your friends and family members, even if not face-to-face.</li>
	<li>Not all children and teens respond to stress in the same way. Some common changes to watch for include excessive crying or irritation in younger children, returning to behaviors they have outgrown, excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, irritability and âacting outâ behaviors in teens, or avoidance of activities enjoyed in the past.</li>
	<li>Please do not hesitate to reach out to your child's counselor, school psychologist, or school social worker with questions about how to best support your children. You are not alone! Our support staff are here to help!Â <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bvillecovid19/tips-for-parents" target="_blank">Visit this link</a>Â for a listing of support staff contact information at each building.</li>

<ul>
<li>We will continue to update our website with information on COVID-19 and district news. Our website is <a href="http://www.bville.org" target="_blank">www.bville.org</a>.

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
The Baldwinsville Central School District continues to monitor and respond to the rapidly evolving developments in the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19).Â  We are working under guidance and direction of the New York State Department of Health, the Onondaga County Health Department, the New York State Education Department, and the Onondaga County Executiveâs Orders to ensure the health and safety of all of our children, staff, parents and visitors to the Baldwinsville Central School District.<br><br>
As per the order of the County Executive, students will be out of school beginning Monday, March 23, 2020. <strong><em>Our schools will officially close on Friday, March 20 at 4:00 p.m. following student dismissal.</em></strong>Â  Students are currently scheduled to return on Tuesday, April 14, 2020.Â  If there is a positive case of COVID-19 in Onondaga County, adjustments will be made to the schedule.Â <br><br><strong><em>This decision has not been taken lightly.</em></strong>Â  As shared by Governor Cuomo and County Executive McMahon schools are important places for students and families.Â  We have a moral obligation to make sure that our families have time to prepare for childcare and that students who depend on school meal programs are provided the support and nutrition they need.Â  Our Districtâs Leadership Team is working around the clock to make certain plans are in place to support our students and their families.Â <br><br><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">Here are some important updates:</span></strong><br><br><strong>Student Attendance:</strong>

<ul>
<li>We recognize that some of you may be uncomfortable sending your children to school.Â  Please know that we respect your right as parents to choose what is best for your child.Â  If you choose not to send your child to school while we remain open this week, your child will be considered <strong><em>excused</em></strong> from school. Â Your child will <strong><em>not be penalized</em></strong> in any way for the excused absence(s).</li>
	<li>Please be certain to notify your studentâs attendance/main office if your child is not going to attend while school is in session.</li>
</ul>
Â <br><strong>Health and Safety at School:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Cleaning measures in our buildings and on our school buses have been enhanced and increased.</li>
	<li>We all must do our part in minimizing the spread of illness â we ask for your commitment in not sending your child to school while they are feeling ill.Â  Likewise, we are communicating the same message to our staff.Â Â </li>
	<li>Each nursesâ office will work to ensure that ill students and staff are separated by at least six feet from those that are well.Â Â Â Â </li>
	<li>The school nurse will place a mask on students or staff assessed to have signs of a respiratory illness, specifically cough and fever.Â The mask is an effective tool in minimizing the spread of any germs and does not imply that the person has any specific illness.</li>
</ul>
Â <br><strong>Cancelation of Extra-curricular and Athletic Events:</strong>

<ul>
<li>As communicated yesterday, all of next weekâs extra-curricular activities and events will be cancelled immediately.Â </li>
	<li>By now, you may be aware that Section III Athletics has announced that effective Monday, March 16, 2020 all interscholastic athletics events will be suspended.Â  The official start date for all Spring sports will be April 14, 2020.Â  The dates and structure of postseason competition will be determined at a later point in time.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Continuity of Instruction:</strong><br>
Â 
<ul>
<li>We thank all of our staff for the dedication, teamwork and flexibility they have demonstrated when assessing our current resources, developing protocols for continued learning, and designing lessons that ensure continuity of instruction. This work will continue this week.</li>
	<li>You can expect further communication from your studentâs building principal as to how teachers will communicate with students during the extended closure.Â <br>
	Â </li>
</ul>
<strong>Access to Technology:</strong><br>
Â 
<ul>
<li>We will make every effort to provide technology devices to students who do not have access to personally owned devices for the purposes of instruction and learning.Â </li>
	<li>In the case where a family does not have internet access, alternative methods of delivering instruction and feedback to students will be utilized.Â </li>
	<li>Additional information will be provided regarding how devices will be made available in the communications that you receive from your building principal.<br>
	Â </li>
</ul>
<strong>Special Education:</strong><br>
Â 
<ul>
<li>Our special education teachers and service providers are working to develop ways of continuing specially designed instruction for those students that have individual education programs (IEPs). Teachers will be reaching out to you to provide further information in this area regarding meeting the individual learning needs of your student.</li>
	<li>District support staff (school counselors, psychologists, social workers, and deans of students) will be available to support students and families as needed throughout the extended school closure.</li>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
The Baldwinsville Central School District continues to monitor and respond to the rapidly evolving developments in the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19).Â Media coverage of these unfolding events can be scary and tap into the fears we all may have, but the reality is that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to report that for the general American public, the immediate health risk from Coronavirus COVID-19 is considered low.Â We are constantly monitoring all aspects of this situation and following the direction of the New York State Department of Health, the Onondaga County Health Department, and the New York State Education Department to ensure the health and safety of all of our children, staff, parents and visitors to the Baldwinsville Central School District.<br><br>
As a District, we have been meeting to discuss how the Coronavirus impacts all of us. Our Superintendentâs Conference Day today was dedicated to prevention and planning in the event of a potential school closure. As of right now, no decision has been made in regard to closing our schools, but we want to be prepared.<br>
We also want to make sure our school community is continuously updated during this evolving situation.Â  Here are some important updates:<br><br><strong>Potential School Closure:</strong>

<ul>
<li>The District will follow the direction of state and county health departments in deciding if schools need to be closed. If the Onondaga County Health Department confirms a case of COVID-19 in a District school, that building will initially be shut down for a minimum of 24-hours while an investigation is conducted to determine if an extended closure period is required. The Health Department will decide if additional buildings should be closed for an extended period of time.</li>
	<li>Families should have emergency plans for the possibility of students being out of school for extended periods.</li>
	<li>Similar to school districts and universities across the state and the nation, we are exploring âcontinued learningâ options in the event of a prolonged school closure.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Prevention, Cleaning and Disinfection</strong>

<ul>
<li>Educational materials about proper handwashing and staying healthy have been distributed to buildings. Teachers are promoting these habits in their classrooms and parents are encouraged to promote them at home.</li>
	<li>Cleaning measures in our buildings and on our school buses have been enhanced and increased.</li>
	<li>We all must do our part in minimizing the spread of illness â we ask for your commitment in not sending your child to school, or to after school programs, while they are feeling ill.Â Likewise, we are communicating the same message to our staff.Â Â </li>
	<li>Please allow your child (and yourself) to rest at home when they are experiencing cold or flu-like symptoms until he/she feels well enough to participate in learning activities.</li>
	<li>Each nursesâ office will work to ensure that ill students and staff are separated by at least six feet from those that are well.Â Â Â Â </li>
	<li>The school nurse will place a mask on students or staff assessed to have signs of a respiratory illness, specifically cough and fever.Â The mask is an effective tool in minimizing the spread of any germs and does NOT imply that the person has any specific illness.</li>
	<li>Please support our request that sick children go home promptly by having emergency arrangements in mind.Â </li>
</ul>
<strong>Cancellations of events and field trips:</strong><br><br>
By now, we are sure many of you are aware that this week Governor Cuomo placed gathering limits on public spaces in New York State due to the growing threat of the Coronavirus. In addition to the Governorâs remarks, the New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) indefinitely postponed the winter season's regional and state athletic championships. The remainder of our winter guard season is also suspended.<br><br>
With all of this in mind and in an abundance of caution, we made the decision to <a href="https://www.bville.org/teacherpage.cfm?teacher=7341" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">cancel large group, evening events</span></a> scheduled for March 16<sup>th</sup> to March 20<sup>th</sup>. These events include the Ray &amp; Durgee All-District Orchestra Concert, the All-District Choral Concerts, the Palmer 5th Grade Wax Museum and the Freshman Dance.Â <br><br>
We do not make any of these decisions lightly. Earlier this week we also made decisions to cancel two field trips â one international trip and one trip to Washington, D.C. We are continuing to meet with all administrators to review upcoming scheduled events, field trips and any large-scale gatherings to determine whether more changes will be made.Â Updates will be provided and all decisions will be revisited as conditions dictate.<br>
No decisions regarding spring sports have been made at this point by the district, Section III Athletics, and/or the New York State Public High School Athletic Association.<br><br><strong>Spring break and travel:</strong><br><br>
With spring break on the horizon, we know that many families are making travel decisions. The New York State Department of Health and New York State Education Department released recommendations to schools regarding international travel, which states that students and faculty returning from currently impacted countries or regions of impacted countries will be required to be under precautionary quarantine for 14 days upon return.<br><br>
We want to make sure families are aware that students who travel to impacted countries or regions during spring break will be impacted by this precautionary quarantine and may not be able to return to school until after the 14 days.<br><br>
We are committed to providing additional updates on a regular basis as circumstances warrant. Please check your email and our website, <a href="http://www.bville.org">www.bville.org</a>, for updates, links, guidance and more.<br><br>
As always, sensible, common sense actions (hand washing/hygiene, staying home when sick, limiting handshakes, etc.), combined with the districtâs stepped-up sanitation and vigilance, remain our best protection moving forward.<br>
Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have.<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,<br><br>
In everything we do, the safety and health of our students and staff is our top priority. In light of that, we want to share an important message about Coronavirus, COVID-19.<br><br>
The most recent information from New York State has more than a dozen confirmed cases of the virus.<br><br>
The District is collaborating and coordinating with county and state healthcare officials in order to monitor and plan for any impact the Coronavirus may have on our school community, as well as reviewing the Districtâs Emergency Response Plans.<br><br>
The situation is rapidly evolving and we know that this is an anxious time. While we do not want to cause any unnecessary fear, we do want to inform you of some of the things we are doing as a District to be proactive concerning the Coronavirus.<br><br><strong>Our actions include the following:</strong>
</div>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">We are reviewing our Districtâs Emergency Response Plans.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Soap and water, and hand sanitizer are available in our buildings and staff members are encouraging frequent use of them.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Custodial staff is reviewing cleaning guidelines and is increasing the frequency of their routine disinfection of our buildings.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Nursing staff is reviewing emergency protocols and implementing preventative measures.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Preventative information is being shared with parents and caregivers of all students.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Prevention information is being posted in common areas in our buildings.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">We will continue to work closely with the Onondaga County Health Department.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Families can help protect their children and prevent the spread of Coronavirus and other illnesses by taking the following precautions:</strong></div>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Remind your children to wash their hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Teach your children not to share personal items like drinks, food or utensils, and to cover their coughs and sneezes with tissues. If a tissue is unavailable, cough or sneeze into your elbow or shoulder, not into your hands.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Know the signs and symptoms of the Coronavirus. Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Keep sick children at home for at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever or do not have signs of fever, without using fever-reducing drugs.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Do not send children to school if they are sick. Students with an excused absence will not be penalized in any way.</li>
</ul>

Superintendent Matthew McDonald wants to make sure parents, guardians and staff members in the Baldwinsville Central School District have the most accurate information regarding the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The New York State Department of Education and the state Department of Health released a letter for parents, which is provided below.Â <br><br>
"It is important to note that the same infection control measures that we use to fight yearly influenza (the flu) protect against respiratory viruses of any type," McDonald said. "Some of the best protection measures are low technology: cover coughs and sneezes, don't touch eye - mouth-nose area, wash your hands, stay home when you are ill."Â <br><br>
As the influenza season is in full swing in Central New York, please continue to follow the CDC and our website for tips on controlling the spread of infection.Â <br><br><span style="font-size:20px;"><u><strong>Here's what you need to know:Â Â </strong></u></span><br><br>
A new coronavirus called 2019 Novel (new) Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This virus had not been found in humans before. This coronavirus can lead to fever, cough and trouble breathing or shortness of breath. There are thousands of diagnosed cases in China and new cases being diagnosed in a number of countries including the United States.<br><br><u><strong>What do we know? </strong></u><br><br>
Since this virus is very new, health authorities continue to carefully watch how this virus spreads. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working hard to learn as much as possible about this new virus, so that we can better understand how it spreads and causes illness. The CDC considers this virus to be a serious public health concern. Based on current information the CDC recommends avoiding travel to China. Updated travel information related to 2019-nCoV can be found at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china<br><br><u><strong>How Does 2019 Novel (New) Coronavirus Spread? </strong></u><br><br>
Health experts believe the virus probably spreads from animals to humans and from person to person. Itâs not clear yet how easily the virus spreads from person-to-person. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not currently a concern for the general public and is not actively circulating among New Yorkers at this time. Therefore, there is no need to cancel school or social events, and there is no need for students or school staff to wear surgical masks at school.<br><br><u><strong>Prevention </strong></u><br>
Â 
<ul>
<li>There are currently no vaccines available to protect against this virus. The New York State Department of Health (DOH) recommends the following ways to minimize the spread of all respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV:</li>
	<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash.</li>
	<li>Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
	<li>CDC recommends that travelers avoid all travel to China.</li>
</ul>
<br><u><strong>Symptoms</strong></u><br><br>
Information to date suggests that 2019-nCoV causes mild-to-moderate illness and symptoms like the flu, including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.<br><br><u><strong>Are visitors from China being screened?</strong></u><br><br>
Yes, as of February 2nd new screening protocols are conducted for individuals entering the US from China at designated airports. PreK-12 schools may have students who attend school and have traveled to various areas in Asia, including China. Students should not be excluded from school or any school activities based on race, country of origin, or recent travel (or a family memberâs recent travel), including to any part of China. Schools may only exclude a student if a local health department informs the school that a student must comply with a quarantine order or the student is symptomatic of a communicable or infectious disease pursuant to Education Law Â§906.<br><br><u><strong>Important Health Information for Those Who Have Recently Traveled to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and Experience Symptoms</strong></u><br>
If you recently traveled to Wuhan, China and feel sick with fever, cough or trouble breathing; OR you develop symptoms within 14 days of traveling there, you should:
<ul>
<li>Seek medical care right away. Call ahead and tell them about your travel and symptoms.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with others.</li>
	<li>Stay home, except for seeking medical care.</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.</li>
	<li>Wash hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
	<li>Contact your local health department.</li>
</ul>
<br>
This is an emerging, rapidly changing situation.
