<h3 id="2020-03-23-continuity-for-learning">
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What is the plan for continuity of learning?</h3>
<div class="hide">

<p>HCPSS staff designed a Continuity of Learning model that will engage students in teacher-supported and teacher-directed distance learning. The plan involves three phases.</p>

<p>For Phase 1, families were provided with <a href="https://www.hcpss.org/health/coronavirus/continuity-learning/#resources">resources to use at home</a> with their children. 

</p>
<p>Phase 2 focused on providing professional development for all instructional staff, including learning how to set up their online classrooms, re-engage students and families, clarify expectations for students, and ensure students have the supports and resources they need to succeed.</p>  

<p>Phase 3 begins distance learning. High school students began distance learning on April 14, followed by middle and elementary school students on April 20.</p>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How can we ensure an effective learning environment at home?
</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>We have compiled a number of <a href="https://www.hcpss.org/health/coronavirus/supporting-instruction/">tips and suggestions to help</a> you and your family transition to a home-based learning environment.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> I can’t remember my password. What should I do?
</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>Students and staff who forget their password and/or username can reset their password and/or manage their account by <a href="https://hcpss.me/account-self-service/">following the directions for Account Self-Service</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> We don’t own a computer. How can my child participate in continuity of learning?
</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>HCPSS staff have been working on designing a Continuity of Learning model that will engage students in teacher-supported and teacher-directed distance learning. Of utmost concern is equitable access to devices by all our 59,000 students.</p>

<p>To better enforce social distancing and safeguard the health of staff, students, and families, HCPSS will ship all technology devices through FedEx directly to the students who need to borrow them. The devices will be left and delivery slips do not need to be signed. All HCPSS students in grades K-12 who request a device will receive one.</p>

<p>Parents/guardians who need to change a previous response or to request a new device can do so via HCPSS Connect. <a href="https://www.hcpss.org/health/coronavirus/devices/#request">Full details are online</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What if I don’t have internet access at home?
</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>Families who do not have internet access may be eligible to participate in the <a href="https://www.internetessentials.com/covid19" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Comcast Internet Essentials</a> program. Comcast additionally has opened free access to its Xfinity WiFi network, making hotspots across the country available to anyone, including non-subscribers, at no cost. Search by zip code or city to find a hotspot near you at <a href="http://wifi.xfinity.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wifi.xfinity.com</a>.</p> 

<p>Wi-Fi also has been extended at every HCPSS school and, in most cases, can be accessed from up to 40 feet from a school’s main entrance.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How will third-quarter grades be calculated?
</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>Third-quarter grading was previously scheduled to end on April 3, 2020. For all students, HCPSS will base third-quarter grades on work assigned on and prior to March 13, 2020, the last day schools were in session, as the majority of the quarter had already taken place when schools were closed. <a href="https://news.hcpss.org/news-posts/2020/04/third-quarter-grading-for-the-2019-2020-school-year/">Additional details</a> are available online.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Will students have any opportunity to bring up lower grades from third-quarter?
</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>Middle and high school students may, at the direction of their teacher, complete work assigned between April 14-24 to improve their third-quarter grade. Middle and high school teachers will provide direction in Canvas for additional assignments. Students do not need to contact teachers for these assignments. The April 14-24 assignment submissions will count toward third-quarter grades and will not be used to lower a grade.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> When will fourth-quarter grading begin?
</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>Fourth quarter begins April 27. The Board of Education on April 16 unanimously approved recommendations for fourth quarter grading for the 2019-2020 school year. 

Students will earn a grade of Pass or Incomplete for each graded subject or course.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Pass is earned for completing at least 50% of Quarter 4 assignments and will count as an A (4.0 points) for the purposes of final grade, GPA calculations, and high school athletic eligibility.</li>
	<li>An Incomplete is earned for completing less than 50% of quarter 4 assignments. Students will have until the 15th day of the following marking period (or September 15, 2020) to complete missing assignments.</li>
</ul>

Athletic eligibility will be determined based on Quarter 4 grades, with one exception: for students with Incomplete grade codes for fourth quarter, eligibility will be determined using third quarter grades. 

Complete details on fourth quarter grading are available online.

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What guidance is the school system following to provide services for my child who has an IEP or 504 Plan?</h3>
<div class="hide"> 
<p>HCPSS is aligning services for students with disabilities with guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). You may find additional information at:</p>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>What is HCPSS’ responsibility for providing specialized instruction and related services to students with IEPs and 504 Plans?</h3> 
<div class="hide"> 
<p>The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) does not provide specific special education implementation procedures when schools are closed for an extended period of time due to exceptional circumstances. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not provide this type of guidance either. HCPSS must adhere to all federal and state guidance on the subject. Current guidance for serving students with disabilities has been provided through the OSERS. The following excerpt from that guidance serves as the basis for our work:</p> 

<p><em>If an LEA continues to provide educational opportunities to the general student population during a school closure, the school must ensure that students with disabilities also have equal access to the same opportunities, including the provision of FAPE. (34 CFR §§ 104.4, 104.33 (Section 504) and 28 CFR § 35.130 (Title II of the ADA)). SEAs, LEAs, and schools must ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, each student with a disability can be provided the special education and related services identified in the student’s IEP developed under IDEA, or a plan developed under Section 504. (34 CFR §§ 300.101 and 300.201 (IDEA), and 34 CFR § 104.33 (Section 504)).</em></p>

<p>Your child’s case manager/service provider has sent or will send an initial letter pertaining to an IEP/504 individual continuity of learning plan. During phone conferences, school staff and parents/guardians will discuss and decide what a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) will look like in light of this unusual closure and each student’s current circumstances.</p>  
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>What happens with my previously scheduled meeting to discuss my child’s IFSP and IEP?</h3>
<div class="hide"> 
<p>All meetings scheduled to be held between March 13–April 3, prior to the school closure, were postponed. There are some issues that may not be able to be fully addressed at this point. For example, decisions that would require complete assessments and reports may not be able to occur because of the process interruption caused by COVID-19. As you hear from your case managers/providers, you can discuss rescheduling.</p> 
</div> 

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>How are legal timelines being addressed?</h3>
<div class="hide"> 
<p>We will do our best to honor timelines. However, federal guidance indicates that public agencies should work with parents to reach mutually agreeable extensions, when appropriate. If you have a concern about timelines, your service provider, case manager and/or DSE staff will be able to discuss next steps and how to document this extension.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Why is the school team giving me the option to discuss my child’s services outside of a formal IEP team meeting?</h3>
<div class="hide"> 
<p>In making changes to a child’s IEP after the annual IEP team meeting, the parent/guardian of a child with a disability and the public agency may agree to not convene an IEP team meeting for the purpose of making those changes. Instead, parents may agree to develop a written document to temporarily amend or modify the child’s current IEP/504. Within HCPSS, this document is referred to as the individualized continuity of learning plan.</p> 
</div>


<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>What if my child receives services in a nonpublic school?</h3>
<div class="hide"> 
<p>All schools in Maryland are closed by the State Superintendent of Education, including physical buildings for nonpublic schools. Most nonpublic schools, however, are implementing a continuity of learning plan for students enrolled in their schools. The nonpublic school staff should contact you as they seek your input about what a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) will look like for your child in light of this unusual closure and your child’s circumstances. They are expected to collaborate with the HCPSS case manager in the Department of Special Education as necessary to ensure continuity of services to students with disabilities. Please reach out to your nonpublic case manager as well as your HCPSS Department of Special Education contact if you have further questions.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>How will students who do not have access to technology receive their instruction/modified instruction?</h3>
<div class="hide"> 
<p>Families were surveyed about technology, online, through phone calls and at food distribution sites to determine their access to technology and the internet. Based on the results from that survey, HCPSS gathered technology for students and is currently distributing devices. Additionally, HCPSS has determined the families that did not reply to the survey and is trying to contact those families to determine their technology needs. Requests for technology will now be made through HCPSS Connect. Instructions have been posted on the <a href="https://www.hcpss.org/health/coronavirus/devices/">HCPSS website</a>, and families may contact their school’s library media specialist for guidance. Technology is also available for HCPSS students receiving nonpublic services if there is an identified need. </p>  
</div>


<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>How will “continuity of services” be provided to students with IEPs who receive home and hospital instruction?</h3>
<div class="hide"> 
<p>Students who have IEPs and are currently receiving Home and Hospital Instruction will receive their instruction from their home school teachers through the HCPSS Continuity of Learning Plan. Additionally, they will continue to receive 1 hour of virtual support each week from their Home and Hospital Teacher.</p>

<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How does the governor’s Stay-at-Home order from March 30 impact school meals and device distribution?</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>All planned HCPSS food and instructional material distribution will continue as scheduled.

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How will this closure impact HCPSS athletics?</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>Updated 3/27/20: In accordance with the actions of the State Superintendent of Schools and the Maryland State Board of Education, the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association <a href="https://www.mpssaa.org/update-2-on-the-current-status-of-public-high-school-interscholastic-athletics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">(MPSSAA) has decided</a> that all interscholastic athletic team gatherings, activities, practices, and contests are suspended until further notice.</p>  

<p>The MPSSAA stated that they will remain vigilant regarding interscholastic athletics and the health and safety of students and school communities. The MPSSAA will also continue to work collaboratively with the Maryland State Department of Education and other relevant state agencies to determine the best route for interscholastic athletics to resume.</p>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What procedures are in place to clean and disinfect schools and facilities? How many buildings have been completed?</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>As of March 30, 2020, and in accordance with guidelines provided by the Howard County Health Department and Maryland State Department of Education, HCPSS operations staff cleaned and disinfected all 77 schools and additional administrative buildings operated and maintained by the school system. All schools have been checked by both a building supervisor and custodial manager.</p> 

<p>The cleaning protocols are extensive and detailed, and required several days in each building to ensure that all surfaces that could be touched by students and staff in every classroom, hallway, bathroom and office were cleaned and disinfected using HCHD-approved materials and procedures. Dedicated teams from HCPSS custodial, grounds and maintenance worked hard to ensure every building and classroom are prepared for the return of students and staff.</p>

<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> What is the process for cleaning buses and how many have been completed?</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>As of March 30, 2020, 98 percent of our buses have been cleaned and disinfected. This equates to 554/563 buses. Based on Governor Hogan’s Stay-at-Home order, the remaining nine buses will be completed once the order is lifted and before schools reopen. The majority of the bus safety inspections already have been completed, and the balance of the inspections will be completed after the order is lifted.</p> 

<p>The cleaning and disinfection process follows instructions provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All non-porous surfaces of the bus that can be touched by students are cleaned and disinfected, including seats, floors, walls and windows. Products are used in accordance with guidance provided by the CDC to ensure proper effectiveness.</p>

<div class="hide">
<p>Social distancing is critical to slow the spread of coronavirus COVID–19. As such, all students enrolled in Apprenticeship Work-Based Learning, G/T Intern/Mentor, Transition Activities, Career and Technical Education (CTE) internships at ARL or as part of Career and Research Development (CRD) will not participate in any on-site work associated with these courses until schools reopen.</p>

<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Will field trips resume once schools reopen?</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>Howard County Public School System Superintendent Dr. Michael Martirano on March 10, 2020, announced that all out-of-state field trips and athletic events, including those to Washington, D.C., are canceled effective immediately due to concerns related to COVID–19 (Coronavirus). All currently approved in-state field trips are being reassessed individually and decisions will be communicated to families if that field trip will be canceled. This decision is in effect through the end of the 2019–2020 school year.</p>

<p>There are no HCPSS-sponsored international field trips. The Board of Education in July 2018 rescinded Policy 8110 Student International Educational Travel and subsequently added language to Board of Education Policy 8100 Field Trips stating that, “HCPSS does not sponsor student travel outside the United States.”</p>

<div class="hide">
<p>The College Board, which oversees the Advanced Placement (AP) Program, is working to develop online solutions for students impacted by Covid-19. College Board is providing free online resources for students that may be accessed through the AP Portal. AP exams will be modified so that students will take a 45-minute online exam at home that will be accessible using a variety of devices including computers, tablets, or smartphones. The scope of the exam is also being modified to address topics and skills most AP teachers and students have already covered in class by early March.</p>

<p>The College Board has also provided the provision that any student already registered for an exam can choose to cancel at no charge. More information about cancellations will be available from HCPSS soon.</p>

<h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How are you ensuring the safety of staff cleaning HCPSS facilities?</h3>
<div class="hide">
<p>The directive to clean and disinfect schools was mandated by the State of Maryland, and we’ve ensured that the products being used to clean and disinfect are not hazardous to our staff. HCPSS Operations are utilizing staff members from the offices of Custodial, Grounds and Maintenance to perform the cleaning and disinfecting of the schools, in accordance with guidelines provided by the Howard County Health Department and Maryland State Department of Education.</p> 

<p>We are using the following products in a diluted form: Earth Sense Multi-Purpose Cleaner and Neutral-Q Disinfectant Cleaner Deodorant. Both products are purchased from National Chemical Laboratories, Inc. The <a href="https://nclonline.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">safety data sheet for the two products</a> can be found online. There are no products in either of these two cleaning mixtures that have enforceable exposure Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL) per OSHA. The only ingredient that could be considered hazardous is in the disinfectant: Quaternary Ammonium Compounds. This particular ingredient does not have a PEL and makes up less than 0.1% of the mixture and respirator protection is not required. All HCPSS staff have safety glasses for eye protection and gloves.</p>
