            <h1>UPDATE: March 30, 2020 6:00 p.m.</h1>

<p>Deer Park Families:</p>

<p>This afternoon, Governor Mike DeWine announced the extended closure of schools through May 1. This announcement was expected, and we are continuing to use this week to develop work for students for the upcoming month, as stated in our update on Sunday, March 28.Deer Park Schools will continue to provide remote learning opportunities through this extended closure.Â You can read the full release by clickingÂ <a href="#Update">HERE</a>.</p>

<p><strong>OHSAA Announcement:</strong></p>

<p>This afternoon, in conjunction with the Governor's announcement, OHSAA Executive Director Jerry Snodgrass announced the continued postponement of all spring sports because facilities are all currently closed. The OHSAA said they expect to re-evaluate the situation following the May 1 timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Adjustment to Food Pass Outs:</strong></p>

<p>Beginning Tuesday, March 31, daily food pass out at Rivers Crossing Church will be adjusted. Pass out will only occur on Wednesdays from noon-6 p.m.Â This does not affect Amity Lunch pass out, which will remain daily from Monday-Friday from 10:30 a.m.-noon.</p>

<p>The Deer Park Library has also made a change to its hours. Meals are still available on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 4-4:30 p.m.Â While the Library is closed to the public curbside meals will be available for youth ages 18 and under, at select locations. Children must be present to receive a meal.Â </p>

<p>At Amity, this week we are serving Smuckers Uncrustable PB&amp;J sandwiches. In addition, we will begin offering many heat-and-serve options. This week will include spaghetti and meatballs (Heating instructions are included in the packs).Â Along with these entrees, each lunch can contain, celery and carrots, broccoli cuts, carrots and/or cherry tomatoes. We also include a variety of fresh fruits, such as apples, oranges, kiwi and cuties. Chocolate and white milk are available as well.</p>

<h1>
<a id="Update" name="Update"></a>UPDATE: March 28, 2020 400 p.m.</h1>

<p>Deer Park Families:</p>

<p>I hope everyone has found a few moments over this last week to spend some time with family, rest, and prepare for the coming weeks. As we near the end of a very unique Spring Break, I wanted to reach out with some new updates, as well as plans we have begun developing in the event the Governor decides to extend our closure beyond the current return date of April 6.</p>

<p>While nothing has been officially announced by the Governorâs office, we are preparing for the likelihood that we will be using virtual or at-home learning through at least May 1 and potentially beyond. Below, we have detailed district-wide measures, as well as building-specific plans we are working to put into place over the next several weeks, once further cancellations are undoubtedly announced.</p>

<p><strong>District Updates:</strong></p>

<p>Lunch will continue to be served to students in need for the duration of the closure. If your situation has changed and you need to request lunch for a student, please fill out the form below:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWYCO2DKkh91gW-raWPAl99Qyfo_5mdcJrXBIHrQ-cNMxvWQ/viewform" target="_blank">Fill out here</a></p>

<p>Teachers of all students will be holding virtual office hours each day from 9-10 a.m. and 1-2 p.m. beginning Monday, April 6th (pending extended school cancellations). During these times, teachers will be reaching out to students and/or parents to discuss progress, offer help with work, or just check in with students. Students may also contact teachers via electronic communication between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday-Friday.Â  These virtual conversations can happen through a variety of ways based on availability of parents and students (e.g. Google Hangout, Schoology, Class Dojo, etc.).</p>

<p>This week, the Governor announced the cancellation of all state mandated testing for the remainder of the academic year. Students will not be taking Ohio State Tests for the 2019-2020 school year.Â </p>

<p>We are currently discussing grading policies for the 4th Quarter report cards. We will give an update on these as soon as we have completed that plan.</p>

<p>If a family does not have internet access available, there are several companies offering internet service during the shutdown. You can find out more information by clicking the link below:</p>

<p><a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/OHEDUDEERPARK/bulletins/2813413" target="_blank">More information</a></p>

<p><strong>Amity Elementary Updates:</strong></p>

<p>Next week, Amity teachers will be developing packets for students just like what was passed out three weeks ago. Rather than have parents come to the school building to pick up packets, all of them will be mailed to students on April 8. We anticipate these will be in hand for students by the following week, beginning April 13.</p>

<p>Teachers may also be providing online assistance and/or additional assignments for students online. If a student does not have an educational device, the district will be providing devices to these students. Please fill out the form below to request a Chromebook (Grades K-6):</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerBjF_OuUql1bezYQCgciiBDpRw09SUIIyGvECEPhFW9uBTA/viewform" target="_blank">Fill out here</a></p>

<p>Regarding Chromebook distribution: All families who filled out a form indicating a need for a Chromebook will be able to pick them up on Wednesday, April 8 from 8 a.m.-3 p.m. Parents will not need to leave their car, and the computers will be delivered from the back gymnasium entrance of Amity from gloved volunteers. If the device cannot be picked up during this day, please contact your building administrator to arrange an alternative pick-up option.</p>

<p><strong>Junior/Senior High School Updates</strong></p>

<p>Students will continue to receive assignments via virtual means moving forward. Teachers will use next week to develop assignments and plans, and then share those out with students. Students who do not have internet access and need paper assignments must fill out the form below in order to request these items be sent. The deadline to fill out this form is Tuesday, March 31. Items will be mailed to students on April 8. We anticipate these will be in hand for students by the following week, beginning April 13.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHLABHyetxRy-zLJ_Cmfe4GU4xwYEag5l7cUa4_ffwB06L6w/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1" target="_blank">Fill out the form</a></p>

<p>I have already received many emails from teachers and administrators detailing and showcasing the hard work your students are putting in each day. We have begun developing ways we can share out some of these great features as well as finding ways we can bring the student body and the community together and turn this negative situation into a positive. Much more on that to come soon!</p>

<p>Thank you all for your dedication and flexibility as we navigate this trying time. We are truly all in this together. We will continue working hard every day to ensure we are giving students the best education possible with the tools available. Please donât hesitate to reach out if you ever have any questions.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jay Phillips<br>
Superintendent</p>

<h1>UPDATE: March 14, 2020 6:30 p.m.</h1>

<p>The following memo was sent Friday afternoon from OHSAA Executive Director Jerry Snodgrass to all OHSAA member school administrators regarding the postponed winter tournaments and spring sports. Since the current situation is rapidly changing, any of these may need to be adjusted. If they are, notification will go out immediately to schools.</p>

<p><strong>Release fromÂ OHSAA:</strong></p>

<p>OHSAA Regional and State Boys Basketball, State Girls Basketball, State Ice Hockey and State Individual Wrestling Tournaments</p>

<p>As announced Thursday, the above-mentioned tournaments are postponed indefinitely. Given the rapidly changing events nationally and statewide, we are assessing the situation daily. It is impossible to make a determination today . . . the reason for continuing them to be âpostponed.â If your team remains in the tournament, you need to remind them that the ânon-interscholastic ruleâ remains in effect. Further, we have implemented indefinitely a no-contact period, which prohibits any coach, paid or volunteer, approved by the Board of Education to provide coaching, instruction or supervising conditioning and physical fitness programs or open gyms to members of a school team in their sports. Again, we are assessing this daily and we WILL keep you up-to-date on a regular basis.</p>

<p><strong>All Sports</strong><br>
A MANDATORY no-contact period is in effect for all school-sponsored sports March 17-April 5, 2020. Additionally, there will be a mandatory shut down of facilities used for the purpose of conducting athletics activities from March 17-April 5, 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Spring Sport Out-of-State Travel</strong><br>
Obviously, this is highly discouraged, and we urge all schools to cancel these trips. We also know that it is impossible in a few cases to obtain refunds. In those instances, we have no choice but to permit that to continue. However, please note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any contest played will be counted toward the total number permitted;</li>
	<li>No NEW trips may be scheduled that have not previously been scheduled, and</li>
	<li>It is highly recommended that the conditions outlined in Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Actonâs order be followed regarding the number of individuals permitted at the event (see the Qâs and Aâs for more information).</li>
</ul>
<p>With the return to school date tentatively set by Governor DeWine for April 6, the following willÂ <strong>TENTATIVELYÂ </strong>be in place:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>April 6 â 10 MANDATORY Practices and/or Acclimatization (if required)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>April 11 All Scrimmages/Regular Season Contests may begin</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Tournaments will remain on dates as currently scheduled</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Please note: Since the current situation is rapidly changing, any of these may need to be adjusted. IF they are, notification will go out immediately to schools. Thank you for your attention to this matter!</strong></em></p>

<h1>UPDATE: March 14, 2020 5:30 p.m.</h1>

<h1>UPDATE: March 14, 2020 4:30 p.m.</h1>

<p>Below, you will find communication released from the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County.</p>

<p>The Deer Park branch of the Cincinnati library will be providing meals to families in need Monday through Friday every day while school is canceled. While the Library will be closed the public, the Deer Park branch will be distributing meals to youth ages 18 and under from 4-5 p.m. each day.Â </p>

<p>Please contact the library if you have any questions.</p>

<p><strong>Release fromÂ Public Library of Cincinnati:</strong><br>
According to Feeding America, nearly 40,000 children in Hamilton County live in a food insecure household. That means one in five children are unsure of where their next meal is coming from. Children facing hunger are more likely to struggle with school and exhibit behavioral problems.</p>

<p>While the Library is closed to the public at this time, we are making free meals available to youth ages 18 and under, in partnership with UMC Food Ministry. Shelf stable, ready to eat meals will be distributed on Monday-Friday while school is out at the following times and locations.</p>

<p>12-1 pm: Elmwood Place, Groesbeck, Madisonville, North Central, Reading and Main Library</p>

<p>2-3 pm: Avondale, Bond Hill, College Hill, Pleasant Ridge, West End, and Westwood</p>

<p>4-5 pm: Corryville, Covedale,Â <strong>Deer Park</strong>, St. Bernard, and Walnut Hills</p>

<p>This service is made possible through federal funding, as part of the USDAâs Child and Adult Care Food Program.</p>

<h1>UPDATE: March 13, 2020 2:22 p.m.</h1>

<p>Deer Park Schools will be distributing breakfast and lunch to students in need during all three weeks of the extended break.</p>

<p>Lunch and breakfast packs will be distributed each day from the back cafeteria entrance of Amity Elementary (pictured below) on Monday-Friday from 10:30 a.m.-noon and will contain lunch for that day and breakfast for the following day.</p>

<p>ALL students can pick up packs, whether elementary or jr./sr. high school level, however, all packs will be distributed from Amity.</p>

<p>Students who are free/reduced lunch eligible will be provided lunches based on their eligibility. Students who are not free/reduced lunch will still be able to pick up a pack for a fee (charged to lunch balances).</p>

<p>Please fill out the form below if you would like your student to receive this breakfast-lunch pack.</p>

<p><strong>Student Medications</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All students who need medications from school over the extended break must have a parent/guardian pick up their medicationÂ between 8 a.m.-3 p.m. on Friday (March 13), Monday (March 16), or Tuesday (March 17).</li>
</ul>
<p>We are anticipating offering breakfast and lunch to students in need over the course of the entire extended break. These logistics are currently being developed and will be shared in more detail this afternoon.</p>

<p>We thank you for your continued patience and flexibility as we work to provide the best opportunities for our students throughout this difficult time. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to your child's building office.</p>

<h1>Update: March 12, 2020 4:13 p.m.</h1>

<p>Deer Park Families:</p>

<p>As many of you may have heard, this afternoon Governor Mike DeWine announced he was signing an executive order mandating the closing of schools for three weeks.</p>

<p>The Deer Park administration has determined that the following plan will be put into place over the course of the shutdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>Students will not report to school beginning Friday, March 13 through Friday, April 3.</li>
	<li>On Tuesday, March 17, families with students grades preschool through 6th grade should come to Amity Elementary to pick up school work that students will be required to complete during the closure. Work can be picked up any time between 8 a.m.-3 p.m.Â </li>
	<li>Deer Park Jr./Sr. High School students will begin receiving assignments via Schoology beginning Tuesday, March 17. Any student without home internet access should report to the Jr./Sr. High School any time between 8 a.m.-3 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17 to pick up copies of their work from each of their teachers.</li>
	<li>All work, whether online or physical copies, will be required to be completed during the closure. Physical copies of work will be collect upon students' return to school.Â </li>
	<li>Teachers of all students will be accessible during regular school hours via normal electronic communication avenues (email, ClassDojo, Schoology, etc.) from March 16-20 and March 30-April 3.</li>
	<li>During our regularly scheduled Spring Break (March 23-27), students will not be required to complete any work. Teachers will not be available to contact during this period.</li>
	<li>We are currently in the process of developing a plan to provide breakfast and lunch to students in need during the closure. More information about this program will be shared in the coming days.</li>
</ul>
<p>We realize that you have many questions, likely more than we are able to answer at this time. We will continue to follow the directives of the Governor and the Ohio Department of Health officials and will communicate any updates and announcements via email to parents and staff. All communications will also be published on www.deerparkcityschools.org. We are certain to meet some challenges in the weeks ahead, but we know that our students are resilient and that we will get through this together.</p>

<h1>UPDATE: March 12, 2020 12:41 p.m.</h1>

<p>Deer Park Families:</p>

<p>Yesterday, Governor Mike DeWine discussed an upcoming executive order indicating that all events including gatherings of large crowds should be canceled/postponed until further notice.</p>

<p>We would like to acknowledge all of the thoughtful questions and concerns that have been sent to us, as we navigate an evolving situation to ensure the best possible outcome in considering the health and wellness of our students, teachers, and staff.</p>

<p>The feedback gives our leadership team the opportunity to discuss family questions and concerns with our public health partners during daily conversations.</p>

<p><strong>How is Deer Park Schools making decisions?</strong><br>
Ohio schools continue to follow the directives of the state health department. The Hamilton County Health Department is the lead agency in our communityâs COVID-19 response, and our schools play an important role in providing stability and safety for our region. Superintendent Jay Phillips works in daily partnership with the Hamilton County Health Department and other superintendents from across the state and country to assess and respond to new information. This is a dynamic situation, and we will continue to adjust and adapt.</p>

<p><strong>What is the impact on upcoming school events?</strong><br>
In a press conference yesterday, Governor DeWine announced that the State is not recommending the closure of K-12 schools at this time. However, he and the Ohio Department of Health strongly recommended limiting social contact and large group gatherings.</p>

<p>Under this recommendation, Deer Park Schools has made the following decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>School events, such as concerts and plays, that invite large numbers (approximately 150+ people) of parents and community members into our schools through March 31 will be postponed until further notice. This will include all concerts and performances, Mother-Son Date Night at Amity, and winter sports awards. We will evaluate opportunities to reschedule these events in the future.</li>
	<li>We will continue to follow the recommendations of the Ohio High School Athletic Association and adjust schedules as needed.</li>
	<li>Extra-curricular meetings and practices will continue at this time.</li>
	<li>All external rentals beginning March 16 through March 31 will be cancelled. This will be reevaluated at the end of the month.</li>
</ul>
<p>We understand that there are upcoming trips planned for our students after March 31. We will continue to monitor the recommendations of the health department and CDC in order to make informed decisions that are in the best interest of our students.</p>

<p><strong>When would a school close?</strong><br>
Deer Park Schools continues to follow the recommendations of the Hamilton County Health Department, the State of Ohio, and area educational professionals. The current recommendation is not to proactively close schools or the district. Families need to prepare for the possibility that schools could be closed as the outbreak continues.</p>

<p>If your childâs school is closed, you will receive a phone call and email the night prior to closure, or with as much advance notice as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally, a school may be closed if staff absences impact school operations and learning. School may also be closed if the cleaning needs across the district surpass the availability of custodial services. In these cases, the district or school will communicate directly with families and the school community.</p>

<p>One additional consideration health responders have asked us to consider is the impact that closing schools has on our health care community. Cincinnati is fortunate to have great medical institutions and providers. Many of our studentsâ families are health care providers or work in the healthcare industry. If schools close, fewer people will be able to provide front-line support. As soon as our public health partners determine schools should proactively close, we will.</p>

<p><strong>If schools close, what is our plan for educating students?</strong><br>
We have plans in place to continue the educational mission; however, the health of our staff and students is whatâs most important. If someone is symptomatic or has contracted the disease, their focus should be on getting better.</p>

<p>In the event of a school closure, our desired outcome is that students continue to have access to relevant, meaningful learning opportunities using our existing systems for sharing information electronically.</p>

<p>Additionally, if a student needs to self-quarantine, teachers will work with that student to make sure that they do not fall behind. Of course, if a student is ill we want that student to focus on getting better!</p>

<p><strong>What about spring break travel?</strong><br>
If you will be traveling during spring break, please monitor the CDC travel advisories. Currently, travelers to Italy, Iran, China, and South Korea must self-quarantine for 14 days when arriving back in the United States. The CDC now recommends that travelers, particularly those with underlying health issues, defer all cruise ship travel. Governor DeWine shares that each traveler should ask themselves âIs it necessary?â Please visit theÂ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html" target="_blank">CDCâs website</a>Â for more information about travel.</p>

<p><strong>Can I keep my child home?</strong><br>
Families know whatâs best for their children and we will honor your decision to keep your child home from school during this time. Absences will be excused.</p>

<p><strong>How are schools and buses being cleaned and disinfected?</strong><br>
All schools are cleaned and disinfected regularly with hospital-grade disinfectants as a standard practice in the district. Buildings continue to be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly, and frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, desks, water fountains, technology, etc. are cleaned daily. Custodians will replace soap and hand sanitizers often, and extra hand sanitizing stations have been placed in the buildings. All buses are being disinfected daily, and the Child Nutrition Department will continue to follow food safety practices and use approved disinfectants.</p>

<p><strong>How do I talk to my child about COVID-19?</strong><br>
As public conversations around COVID-19 increase, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill. Parents, family members, school staff, and other trusted adults can play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and minimizes anxiety or fear. The CDC has createdÂ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html" target="_blank">guidance</a>Â to help adults have conversations with children about COVID-19, and ways children can avoid getting and spreading the disease.</p>

<p><strong>How are schools helping students prevent COVID-19?</strong><br>
We are providing resources, supplies and additional time for students to wash their hands regularly.Â Please help us by keeping sick children home.</p>

<p>Anyone that has symptoms of any illness should stay home until they are without fever and without medication for 24 hours. If students exhibit illness or COVID-19 related symptoms we will isolate them, and contact a parent or guardian to come pick them up immediately.</p>

<p><strong>What can staff and students do to stay healthy?</strong><br>
Please take theÂ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html" target="_blank">extra precautions</a>Â that are recommended by the CDC, such as hand washing, covering a cough or sneeze with a tissue, and staying home when you are sick.</p>

<p>Again, we appreciate your partnership and patience, and will continue to provide regular updates as this rapidly changing situation evolves.</p>

<h1>UPDATE: March 11, 2020 11:15 a.m.</h1>

<p>Deer Park Families</p>

<p>We wanted to provide you with another brief update regarding the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Deer Park Schools continues to work closely with the Centers for Disease Control, the Ohio Department of Health, and Hamilton County Public Health as the situation evolves.</p>

<p><strong>At this time, Deer Park Schools is not planning on imminent closures.Â </strong></p>

<p>However, our staff is actively preparing assignments and lessons that can be delivered electronically in the event that the district is required to close by health officials.Â </p>

<p>Below, you will find an attached letter communicating the measures we are taking to adequately prepare should a significant closure be determined to be necessary anytime in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/OHEDUDEERPARK/2020/03/11/file_attachments/1397985/COVID-19%20Parent%20Communication%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank">Read the Full LetterÂ </a></p>

<p>As a reminder, there are several preventative measures you can take to help protect yourself and to protect others in an effort to prevent illness.</p>

<p><strong>Take steps to protect yourself</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Clean your hands often</strong>

	<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
		<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
		<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>
<strong>Avoid close contact</strong>
	<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
		<li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take steps to protect others</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stay home if youâre sick</strong>

	<ul>
<li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>
<strong>Cover coughs and sneezes</strong>
	<ul>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>
		<li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
		<li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wear a facemask if you are sick</strong>

	<ul>
<li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare providerâs office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
		<li>If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>
<strong>Clean and disinfect</strong>
	<ul>
<li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
		<li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>UPDATE: March 6, 2020 3:00 p.m.</h1>

<p>At Deer Park Schools, the health, safety and well-being of students and staff are top priorities.</p>

<p>With the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) making headlines, district officials want to make sure to reinforce preventive safety measures and to offer additional information.</p>

<p>The symptoms of COVID-19 that may appear 2-14 days after exposure are similar to that of the flu; fever and cough. One additional symptom that is present in COVID-19 is shortness of breath. The virus is spread mainly from person-to-person.Â Â </p>

<p>The best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are the same preventions that are recommended for the spread of the flu and common cold. Students, staff, and families are encouraged to be mindful of key preventive measures.Â </p>

<p>Handwashing is extremely important in the prevention of illness.Â  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; if you are unable to use soap and water, hand sanitizers that include 60%-95% alcohol are recommended, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, stay home when you are sick, and use proper cough etiquette (coughing/sneezing into the elbow).Â <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJG72sycQB8&amp;feature=youtu.be">Here is a great video</a>Â to watch with your children about hand washing.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that at this time, there have only been a small number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States. District officials are closely monitoring the situation and taking guidance from the Ohio Department of Health and theÂ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. There is currently no recommendation to close schools in the United States.</p>

<p>Students, staff and families are encouraged to be mindful of key preventive measures. The CDC offers some tips on its website that can be useful in avoiding the spread of this and other illness.</p>

</ul>
<p>As with any illness, your child should remain home if symptoms are serious enough to interfere with your childâs ability to learn. If your childâs temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or greater, (s)he should remain home until they are fever-free for a full 24-hours before they return to school.Â </p>

<p>Keeping children home when they are sick is critical for prevention.Â  Please refer toÂ <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/OHEDUDEERPARK/2020/01/12/file_attachments/1357232/Parent%20Guidelines%20letter.docx.pdf">these health guidelines</a>Â if you are unsure whether to keep your child home from school.</p>

<p>We will continue to update you with information as we know it.</p>
