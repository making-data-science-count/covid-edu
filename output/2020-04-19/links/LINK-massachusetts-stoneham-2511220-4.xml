<p>Good evening, This is John Macero, Superintendent of Stoneham Public Schools with important updates</p>

<p>Schools Update</p>

<p>Over the past couple of days web based meetings have occurred with Central Office, Principals and Department Supervisors as well as building based meetings with Principal’s and their leadership teams.  These meetings focused on defining student engagement given DESE's message (Commissioner Riley) that anything outside of the school setting cannot replicate school learning and must take into account equity for students within districts as well as school to school and district to district.  Therefore the focus for our academic engagement with students will focus on academic resources and enrichment activities that support previously taught content and skills. As we continue through the next few weeks, we will continually reassess the learning materials and resources we are offering.</p>

<p>The staff are eager to begin reconnecting with their students during this tumultuous time. Information will be forthcoming tomorrow on how the process will begin Monday, March 23rd. Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>Reminder, Meals are available Monday – Friday, at either Stoneham High School or Robin Hood between 10 am -1pm</p>

<p>Thank you and please be well.</p>

<p>Stoneham Coalition</p>

<p>Stoneham Coalition has created a Community Resources Document. The document is attached  for your review. Thank you Stoneham Coalition.</p>

<p>Playgrounds and Play Structures</p>

<p>Note Regarding Senior Center Services:</p>

  School Update</h3>

<p>I hope you are all coping well over these last few days. As a reminder, there will be no school assignments given this week.  Our purpose this week is to allow families and staff to digest the new reality of what is going on and take a breath.  At the current time all school meetings (including IEP meetings) will be cancelled and rescheduled when school is reopened. In the coming days principals and/or teachers will be reaching out to you regarding next steps.<br>
  In the meantime relax and stay safe.<br>
  All School Buildings are now closed with the exception of Stoneham High School and Robin Hood where School Breakfast and Lunches will be available for pick up between 10 AM -1 PM only!<br><br>

<h3>Message from the Superintendent</h3>

<p>  Thank you to Kathy Martin, Executive Director of Technolgy, and her staff today for cleaning each chromebook and distributing them to Grades 3 &amp; 4. I also want to give a shout out to the staff who assisted at each school. <br>
  Any student who was not able to pick up their Chromebook in grades 3-6 can do so tomorrow between the hours of 10AM - Noon at the Highschool(I repeat High School not your Elementary School) If you are unable to pick up please email your school Principal and we will figure out an alternative option.<br>
  Thank you to all our Nurses who came in today to assist in returning meds to those families. If a parent still needs to pick up medicine please email Sandra Malzone at smalzone@stonehamschools.org to schedule a pick up.<br>
  Just a reminder we have two pick up spots for Breakfast and Lunches. Breakfast and Lunches are available at either Stoneham High School or Robin Hood Elementary School. Pick up times are now between 10AM - 1 PM. Both Breakfast and Lunches will be available at those times. If you are unable to pick up a meal please email me at jmacero@stonehamschools.org and we will figure out an alternative option.<br>

<h3>Message from the Superintendent</h3>

<p>Good Morning,</p>

<p>Ths is John Macero, Superintendent of Stoneham Public Schools with an important announcement. I hope everyone is doing well under these trying times. Please understand the purpose of closing of all schools is to help mitigate the spread of this virus. Therefore we need to use Social Distancing at all times over the next two weeks and perhaps beyond. I know this may be difficult for our children to understand ,because they look at this as a Snow Day but that is not the case!!!</p>

<p>Parents I need your help in communicating that to your children. Please see an article that I have included below called: Social Distancing: This is not a Snow Day. </p>

<p>https://medium.com/@ariadnelabs/social-distancing-this-is-not-a-snow-day-ac21d7fa78b4</p>

<p>I hope you will find this article helpful.</p>

<p>As always please be safe!</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<h3>Message from the Superintendent</h3>

<p><u><strong>TOWN OF STONEHAM BOARD OF HEALTH</strong></u><br>
The Town, at this time, has taken pre-emptive precautionary measures in order to limit the spread of the COVID-19 Virus. At this time, no positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported by the CDC. We ask that all residents take precaution in ensuring that they are doing their part to limit the spread of the disease. Proper handwashing, use of hand sanitizers and limiting physical contact will be the biggest factors in ensuring that you and your family are protected. Daily updates are being provided by the CDC and Massachusetts Department of Public Health in order for the Town of Stoneham to provide you with the most accurate information available. The Stoneham School department has closed all schools until 3/27, during which time the full sterilization and sanitization of the facilities will take place. We reiterate that these actions are purely precautionary.  We urge all residents to remain calm and collected during this time. </p>

<p>Please refer to the Town of Stoneham website for further information.  www.stoneham-ma.gov</p>

<h3>Message from the Superintendent</h3>

<p>Dear Parents,</p>

<p>Our district and our community recognizes that we are in a period of uncertainty in which conditions and the availability of information are evolving rapidly. Please read the below updates and guidelines for moving forward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Over the last 72 hours the district in partnership with the union leadership and principals have been developing an Education Contingency Plan in case School is closed for a period of time. The plan is a 3 Leveled Plan that includes remote teaching from school and or Home. This plan will be presented Monday evening at a Special School Committee Meeting. The School Committee Meeting will be held in the Middle School Library at 7 p.m. My recommendation would be to watch it online live at <a href="https://www.stonehamtv.org/ondemand">https://www.stonehamtv.org/ondemand</a>, we would like to avoid large gatherings.</li>
	<li>Where explicit and clearly defined recommendations from public health officials (DPH, CDC, Board of Health) or the Governor's office are available we will adhere to them. oAt this time, those clearly defined recommendations include no international student travel and no out of state student travel.</li>
	<li>Where recommendations exist but they are not clearly defined (e.g., cancel large gatherings) we will seek clarity and request explicit criteria and thresholds for the implementation of social distancing measures from public health officials. I will be participating in a Conference Call with The Commissioner of Education Friday morning at 8:30 AM.</li>
	<li>I will be attending a meeting with town department heads Friday morning regarding COVID-19 and may have additional information following that meeting.</li>
	<li>It is important to remember that things are fluid - we must be prepared for the possibility of changes with little or practically no notice. We may cancel an event the day of or an hour before. We would prefer not to do this but we are committed to following a consistent, logical, and informed decision-making process to avoid implementing measures that will not help our community achieve its public health objectives.</li>
	<li>All Scheduled Field trips before April vacation have been cancelled.</li>
	<li>All Scheduled Field Trips after April Vacation will be reassessed in 30 days.</li>
	<li>Stoneham currently has used 1 snow day to date. Therefore if there are no additional cancellations school would be completed on June 15th, however if we have additional days off due to unforeseen circumstances we would be required to make up those days up to Friday, June 19th, but not beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some resources regarding how to talk with your child regarding the coronavirus.</p>

<p><em>Resources:</em> <a href="https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources-and-podcasts/school-climate-safety-and-crisis/health-crisis-resources/talking-to-children-about-covid-19-(coronavirus)-a-parent-resource" target="_blank">The NASP released a resource for parents: </a></p>

<p>There is no doubt these are trying times and I appreciate everyone's commitment as we work together to ensure safety for all our students, staff and community.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

Superintendent Stoneham Public Schools</p>
