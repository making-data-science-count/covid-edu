              <p>Along with many areas around the world,  the Commonwealth of Virginia is experiencing an expanding outbreak of  respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This virus can  spread from person-to-person, and the number of diagnosed cases is growing.  Accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 is available through the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/">Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> and the <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/novel-coronavirus/">Virginia Department of Health (VDH)<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> dedicated  websites.   </p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="symptoms">Symptoms  of COVID-19</h2>
              <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 include: fever, cough  and shortness of breath. Parents should remain vigilant and observe their  children for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html">COVID-19 symptoms<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>. If your child experiences  these symptoms, contact your local health department or health care provider.  Your doctor will decide if your child needs to be tested or be seen in person.  Parents are encouraged to contact their doctor prior to an office visit in  order to reduce viral transmission to others. Please note that individuals who  are mildly ill may not need  to be tested and should isolate (keep away from other people) and be taken care  of at home.<br>
                Positively <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/coronavirus/what-to-do-if-you-have-confirmed-or-suspected-coronavirus-disease-covid-19/">diagnosed or students exposed to COVID-19<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> will  receive information from VDH or their health care provider regarding management  of this condition. </p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="exposure">Exposure to COVID-19</h2>
              <p>If  you or your child have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19,  follow <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/13/2020/03/MM_Close_Contact_03082020.pdf">VDH advice<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>. The VDH recommends that you  self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of the potential contact and monitor  your health. For additional questions about staying home or monitoring your  health, call 877-ASK-VDH3 (877-275-8343). If you are diagnosed with COVID-19,  take <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">steps to prevent the  spread of COVID-19 when you are sick<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>. </p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="help">Helping  Your Child to be Resilient</h2>
              <p>Children may be anxious and will look to  adults for guidance on concerns about COVID-19.

Teaching children positive preventive measures,  talking with them about their fears, and giving them a sense of some control  over their risk of infection can help reduce anxiety. Specific guidelines  include:</p>
              <ul>
<li>Maintain a normal routine to the  extent possible.</li>
                <li>Discuss new practices with your  child to include activities that improve emotional health such as taking walks,  calling a friend, exploring online educational or cultural opportunities, or  creating an art project. </li>
                <li>Practice and model basic hygiene  and healthy lifestyle practices.</li>
                <li>Be honest and accurate while  remaining calm, easing fears and reassuring for your child. </li>
                <li>Limit exposure to news and media  stories that may be upsetting.</li>
              </ul>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) offer additional tips for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fcoping.html">managing stress and anxiety<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>.</p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="plan">Social Distancing</h2>
              <p> To <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html">prevent the spread<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> in communities, the CDC recommends households protect  themselves and others by social distancing, which is avoiding large  gatherings and maintaining distance (about 6 feet) from others when possible.  School closures are one form of social distancing. Children and families are  also encouraged to practice social distancing in their daily lives while  schools are closed. The CDC offers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children.html">tips to keep kids healthy<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> while school is out.  Social distancing means remaining out of</p>
              <ul>
<li>Public places where close contact  with others may occur (such as shopping centers, movie theaters, stadiums);</li>
                <li>Workplaces (unless the person  works in an office space that allows distancing from others);</li>
                <li>Schools and other classroom  settings;</li>
                <li>Local public transportation (such  as on a bus, subway, taxi, rideshare, plane, ship).</li>
              </ul>
<p>The American Psychological Association  (APA) offers <a href="https://www.apa.org/practice/programs/dmhi/research-information/social-distancing">information about social distancing<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>, the  differences between quarantine and isolation, and ways to get the social  support you need. For social distancing to be effective, parents are encouraged  to limit playdates and activities to those where distance can be maintained  from each other to avoid potential exposure to COVID-19. </p>
              <p> While social distancing is important to  reduce the spread of COVID-19, it is also resulting in limited work for some  individuals and families. This can lead to financial insecurity. For  recommendations for high school students and families, the National Child  Traumatic Stress Network has created a <a href="https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources/coping_in_hard_times_youth_high_school_college_age.pdf">guide to coping during hard times<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>.</p>
              <p> Planning for potential self-quarantines or  social distancing will save time, frustration, and anxiety for parents. It will  also help children feel comforted and prepared for changes to their normal  routine. This <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/13/2020/03/Checklist-for-COVID-19.pdf">preparedness checklist<span class="hidden">-This is a PDF document.</span><img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="file_type"> (PDF)</span> will  help parents take steps to lessen the impact of a severe coronavirus (COVID-19)  pandemic on their  family. Many of these steps are good advice to help families during any disaster, like an  earthquake or flood.</p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="clean">Cleaning  Recommendations for the Home </h2>
              <p>Family members can  practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables,  doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks) with  household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants that are appropriate for  the surface, following label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe  and effective use of the cleaning product, including precautions you should  take when applying the product, such  as wearing gloves and making sure there is good ventilation during use of the product.  The CDC provides additional  guidance on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html">home cleaning<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> and disinfection of households. </p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="child">Child Care for Essential Personnel</h2>
              <p>Parents and families  who are in search of child care for essential personnel, which is currently permitted under  the Governor’s current order, can find more information on the <a href="https://www.childcareaware.org/state/virginia/">Child Care Aware website<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>. </p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="schools">What Parents Can Expect from Schools</h2>
              <p>Governor Ralph Northam ordered all K-12  schools in Virginia to close for the remainder of the academic year in response  to the continued spread of COVID-19.  Localities will maintain authority over  specific staffing decisions to ensure students maintain continuity of services  or learning, while protecting the public health of teachers and staff. </p>
              <p> The VDOE has issued guidance to Virginia  school divisions regarding COVID-19 via Superintendent’s memos, emails,  webinar, and links to resources. These communications are available on the  VDOE’s<a href="/support/health_medical/office/covid-19.shtml"> COVID-19 and Virginia Public Schools webpage<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>.  The VDOE continues to issue guidance to help  divisions execute plans to continue instruction, while ensuring students are  served equitably, regardless of income level, access to technology, English  learner status or special needs. This includes options for virtual learning,  additional instruction through summer programming and integrating instruction  into coursework next year.  </p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="nutrition">School  Nutrition</h2>
              <p>The VDOE has been awarded a waiver from the  USDA to approve waivers to allow school divisions to provide meals in  non-congregate settings due to COVID-19. Parents and families can find sites  approved for meal service on the  <a href="http://schoolmealfinder.hoonuit.com">School  Meal Finder website</a> (this information is continually updated and  additional details with their school division). Families can also text “food”  or “comida” to 877-877 to learn more about food options near them. </p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="grad">Graduation  Requirements, Credits, and Continuity of Learning</h2>
              <p>The VDOE has thoughtfully considered the  impact on local school divisions and students as a result of extended school  closures. Ultimately local school divisions will make decisions about exactly  how learning is continued for students. VDOE has issued <a href="/support/health_medical/office/covid-19-grad-credits.shtml">Guidance on Graduation Requirements,  Awarding of Credits, and Continuity of Learning</a> that addresses students  graduating in the 2019-2020 school year, students enrolled in high school  credit bearing courses graduating in 2020-2021 and after, and students in  grades K-8 and students in preschool. This guidance focuses on alternative pathways to  demonstrate learning and a focus on ensuring students are equitably prepared  for success in subsequent courses.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="grade">Grading and Grade  Point Averages</h2>
              <p>VDOE  recognizes that grade calculations and GPA are a local policy issue. Some  schools may choose variations of finalizing students’ grades. VDOE recommends  that school divisions establish a methodology to fairly calculate grades based  on work previously completed and a methodology for including said grades in GPA  calculations and on student transcripts. VDOE also recommends that if a school  division decides to offer letter grades on an individual basis, no letter grade  should be lower than the student’s grade on March 13, 2020. </p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="learn">Learning at Home</h2>
              <p>Parents and families can support  students’ thinking and learning during extended school closures. </p>
              <ul>
<li>Collaborate  with your child to organize the day to include time for learning, activities  and exercise. </li>
                <li>Read to  and with your child and have conversations about what you have read together.</li>
                <li>Take a  walk and ask about what your child is seeing and about being a good citizen.</li>
                <li>Encourage  critical thinking through cooking together or planning a garden.</li>
                <li>Encourage  conversations about mathematics in your child’s day.</li>
                <li>Explore  your child’s creativity by creating art, music, or dance.</li>
                <li>Write a  letter to a family member or friend or community hero.</li>
                <li>Be mindful  of screen time and have alternatives for children to play outside.</li>
                <li>Listen to your child about his or her  feelings and fears and offer comfort, honesty, and reassurance.</li>
              </ul>
<p>The VDOE encourages you to review  resources provided by your local school division, public libraries, public  media, civic and community groups, and other resources, including those found  on the Department’s website - search for "families" or visit the VDOE <a href="/families/families/index.shtml">For  Families webpage</a>. Resources such as <a href="http://smhp.psych.ucla.edu/pdfdocs/homeactivity.pdf">Activities for Kids While  Schools Are Closed<span class="hidden">-This is a PDF document.</span><img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="file_type"> (PDF)</span> and <a href="https://stories.audible.com/start-listen">Free Audibles for Kids<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> can help keep children active  and engaged while schools are closed.</p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="students-disabilities">Students with  Disabilities</h2>
              <p>If a school closure causes educational  services for all students to pause within a school or division, then the  school/division is generally not required to provide services to the affected  students eligible for special education services during that same period of  time. If a school division does begin to offer instructional services by  alternative means (e.g.  e-learning, distance learning), the division will remain responsible for  the free appropriate public education (FAPE) of its students eligible for  special education services with an individualized education program (IEP). The division should ensure that  the provision of services are inclusive of both special education and related  services.</p>
              <p> Once school resumes, the school must return to  providing special education and related services to students with disabilities  in accordance with the student’s IEP, or for students entitled to FAPE under  Section 504, consistent with any plan developed to meet the requirements of  Section 504. Additionally, after an extended closure, divisions are responsible  for reviewing how the closure impacted the delivery of special education and  related services to students eligible for special education services.  Additional specific guidance will be provided to division-level special  education directors.</p>
              <p> The  VDOE Department of Special Education and Student Services offers a monthly <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/VADOE/bulletins/28420d5">Engage Your Family Newsletter</a> with information and resources  especially for families of students with disabilities.  To subscribe to this newsletter, go to the <a href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/VADOE/subscriber/new">VDOE Subscriber Preferences  webpage</a>, and  when prompted at step three, click “Information for Parents and Families.”   </p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="bully">Bullying and  Harassment</h2>
              <p>COVID-19 is not at all connected to race,  ethnicity, or nationality. School staff should be mindful that bullying,  intimidation, or harassment of students based on actual or perceived race,  color, national origin, or disability (including the actual disability of being  infected with COVID-19 or perception of being infected) may result in a  violation of state and federal civil rights laws. School divisions must take  immediate and appropriate action to investigate what occurred when responding  to reports of bullying or harassment. If parents and families believe their  child has experienced bullying, harassment, or intimidation related to the  COVID-19 outbreak, they should contact the school principal or division  superintendent. Parents can help their child prevent <a href="https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources-and-podcasts/school-climate-safety-and-crisis/health-crisis-resources/countering-covid-19-(coronavirus)-stigma-and-racism-tips-for-parents-and-caregivers">COVID-19 related stigma and racism<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>.</p>
              <h2 tabindex="-1" id="test">Testing</h2>
              <h3>Federal and State Testing</h3>
              <p>On March 23, 2020, Governor Northam ordered all K-12 schools in  Virginia to close for the remainder of the academic year as a response to the  continued spread of COVID-19. As such, the administration of the SOL tests, the  local scoring and score entry requirements for the Virginia Alternate  Assessment Program, and the administration of the ACCESS for ELs assessment for  English Learners are suspended. </p>
<h3>SAT Testing</h3>
              <ol>
<li>The College  Board is canceling the May 2, 2020, SAT administration. Makeup exams for the  March 14 administration (scheduled March 28) are also canceled. </li>
                <li>Registered  students will receive refunds.</li>
                <li>The College  Board will provide future additional SAT testing opportunities for students as  soon as feasible, in place of canceled administrations. </li>
              </ol>
<p>For more information, please visit the <a href="http://collegeboard.org">College  Board website<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>.</p>
              <h3>ACT Testing</h3>
              <ol>
<li>ACT has  rescheduled the April 4, 2020, national ACT test date to June 13, 2020, in  response to concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19. </li>
                <li>ACT will  communicate directly with all students currently registered for the April 4,  2020, ACT test. </li>
                <li>All students  registered for the April 4 test date will receive an email from ACT in the next  few days informing them of the postponement and instructions for next steps. </li>
              </ol>
<p>For  additional information please visit the <a href="http://www.act.org/">ACT website<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>. </p>
              <h3>AP Testing </h3>
              <p>The College Board provided information on March 20 that begins to  outline an alternative plan for AP testing review and administration.</p>
              <ol>
<li>The College Board is providing <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/coronavirus-updates#free-ap-classes">free remote learning resources<img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a> to students by  AP teachers beginning on Wednesday, March 25, 2020. </li>
                <li>Traditional face-to-face exam  administrations will not take place. Students will take a 45-minute online  free-response exam at home that will only include topics and skills that most  AP teachers and students covered by early March. </li>
                <li>Students will be able to take  these streamlined exams on any device they have access to—computer, tablet, or  smartphone. Taking a photo of handwritten work will also be an option. </li>
                <li>Colleges support this solution and  are committed to ensuring that AP students receive the credit they have worked  this year to earn. For decades, colleges have accepted a shortened AP Exam for  college credit when groups of students have experienced emergencies. </li>
                <li>We’ll continue to support students  with free resources through exam day. While we encourage students to wait until  closer to the test date to decide, <strong>any  student already registered for an exam can choose to cancel at no charge</strong>.</li>
                <li>The College Board recognizes that the digital divide could  prevent some low-income and rural students from participating. Working with  partners, they will invest so that these students have the tools and  connectivity they need to review AP content online and take the exam. If your  students need mobile tools or connectivity, you can <a href="https://collegeboard.tfaforms.net/74"><strong>reach  out to them directly to let them know</strong><img src="/images/icons/external_link16.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="This link takes you out of the Virginia Department of Education website"></a>.</li>
                <li>The full exam schedule, specific  free-response question types that will be on each AP Exam, and additional  testing details will be available by April 3. </li>
              </ol>
