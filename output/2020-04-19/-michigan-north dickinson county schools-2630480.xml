<span class="tagline">Welcome to the North Dickinson County 
				School web-page. It is my sincere hope that students will have a 
				successful and rewarding school experience. The community, staff 
				and Board of Education has provided our students with many 
				opportunities to grow accademically, socially, and physically. 
				Our school staff is made up of many caring and dedicated people 
				who will work very hard to give the best educational experience 
				possible. In return, we ask our students to put forth their best 
				effort in all of their classes and get involved in school 
				activities. <br><br>
				If there is any way I can help you during the school year, 
				please be sure to ask; my door is always open.<br><br>

			From Mrs. Inglese<br><br>
			Thank you for being patient in this time of confusion. Our teachers 
			are working very hard to put together a plan for each of their 
			classes to get us through until the end of the academic year. We are 
			required to submit our plan to the ISD which will include how our 
			teachers are intending to educate your child. Each teacher is 
			willing to accommodate your children to ensure that education is 
			provided for all. As part of our educational plan, we have to make 
			the make many assurances that we will make every effort to educate 
			our students. Our expectation is that our students will be “up and 
			running” academically April 13 or 14 either with online content or 
			packets sent home. This newsletter is serving as our notification to 
			pupils and parents of our educational plan. Please read each 
			individual teacher plan as it applies to your child so you are aware 
			of what is expected for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year.<br><br>
			Please help to hold your child accountable for the work that is sent 
			home during this time. As you will see, many of the teachers in 
			grades 4 through 11 will be relying on technology. If your child 
			does not have the ability to access the internet, each teacher is 
			making a separate lesson plan and will have packets to send home to 
			your child. Many of the teachers wrote in their newsletter articles 
			that parents will have to come get their children’s text books. We 
			will be sending out our buses on Tuesday, April 14, 2020 for their 
			afternoon route. The bus will contain student locker/desk contents 
			as well as materials needed for students to work from home. We are 
			asking the parents to meet the bus (not your child) and pick up your 
			Nordic’s materials. If you are unable to, please call the school to 
			schedule a time to pick it up. The buses will run their regular 
			evening route so please be on time at the bus stop. If you receive 
			textbooks from your teacher it will be expected that they are 
			returned at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year.</p>

			At this time, we are unsure what is going on with our senior 
			students. As we get more information we will be in touch with 
			seniors and their parents. We ask the seniors to check their Nordic 
			email regularly for updates. If you were in good academic standing 
			as of March 13, 2020 Governor Whitmer figures that you are finished 
			for the year and will obtain credit for your classes. However, we 
			strongly encourage you to continue with your work as you prepare for 
			your postsecondary career. If you are taking a dual enrollment 
			course you will absolutely have to finish these courses. If you are 
			a senior that was struggling with academics at that time you will 
			have to do quarter 4 work to earn credit for the semester. These 
			students will be contacted individually. <br>
			Please feel free to call the District office if you have questions 
			after reading this newsletter. I cannot promise that we will have 
			all the answers, but we will do our best to find the answers to your 
			questions. All of the staff at ND misses our Nordics and cannot wait 
			for this to be over so we can see our students again. Please ask 
			your kids to sing Row the Boat to you (they should all know it by 
			now) 143 Nordics!</p>

			our school district crosses several different political 
			jurisdictions. If you have questions regarding serving as a Board 
			member, please contact the District Office. You must either file 
			nominating petitions or pay a $100.00 fee and you must complete and 
			file an Affidavit of Identity. The deadline for all paperwork must 
			be completed and submitted no later than July 21, 2020 at 4:00 p.m. 
			You pick up and then file all completed paperwork with the County 
			Clerk office that is located in the Dickinson County Courthouse.</p>

			 <strong>Bond Proposal-August 4 Election</strong><br>
			By: Michael Roell, Business Manager<br><br>
			The North Dickinson School District will have a request for millage 
			on the August 4, 2020 election. The millage request will ask the tax 
			payers to consider a 1 mill tax increase for 3 years for the 
			purchase of school buses, acquiring and installing instructional 
			technology and instructional technology equipment and re-equipping 
			the school building. The district again plans to reduce the levy on 
			the 2 mill sinking fund to 1 mill for the 3-year period to keep the 
			property taxes in check. <br><br><strong>Elementary Special Education~ Mrs. Hord</strong><br><br>
			I have sent home reading intervention packets for my elementary 
			students.  Being that these interventions are at your child's 
			current reading level and different for each student, I decided to 
			send home the level they are currently at as well as the next two 
			levels.  There should be enough in these packets to keep your child 
			reading even through the summer.  These are supplemental materials 
			to help increase reading fluency, accuracy and comprehension.  Your 
			child's classwork from their general education teacher should come 
			first.  As I stated in the letter I sent with the packets, these are 
			designed to do one short story a week and can be completed in just 
			5-10 minutes per day. Please email me at ahord@go-nordics.com or 
			send me a text letting me know that your child received their 
			packet.  I would also like to hear from you if their packet did not 
			come.   Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns 
			regarding their general education work as well.  We are all in this 
			together and I am willing to help you any way that I can.  <br><br><strong>Kindergarten</strong><br><br>

			It has been nice to keep in touch with you first graders!  Keep 
			calling, texting, emailing and writing letters.  I will continue to 
			send home work for you every two weeks.  Your reading stories are on 
			AR.  I will send home your logins in your next packet.  We will be 
			covering measurement and fractions soon in math, so be on the 
			lookout for some fun activities to do at home!  If your parents have 
			any questions, they can contact me at any time.  Remember to get 
			some exercise every day, build or draw something and also be helpful 
			to your parents.  We can get through this together! <br>

			Dear Nordic 5th grade students and Parents,<br>
			I’m writing to talk a little bit about what my plan is with 
			continuing instruction throughout the remainder of the school year. 
			As you probably have heard we’ve been informed by Governor Whitmer 
			we are required to give guidelines for students in the state to 
			continue some type of curriculum to finish out the 2019-2020 school 
			year. For 5th grade, I have chosen to use the online program called 
			Kahn Academy. I have chosen content, which we would have focused on, 
			had we been able to return to school. I also believe it to be a 
			program which the students can navigate with little to no assistance 
			from parents, as I understand you have to work and take care of your 
			families.<br>
			I have set up our class with a class code so you can see the 
			assignments I have assigned. I will attempt to provide 2 weeks of 
			curriculum at a time. Since this is new to me, I’m hoping I don’t 
			give too much. Under the guidelines set forth by our state, our 
			expectation is that you will work on each core subject (math, 
			history, language arts, and science) for approximately 15 minutes 
			per day, which will equate to 60 minutes per day. Understand that 
			when you first open up my classroom, it will look like a ton of 
			assignments, but many are a 2-5 minute video at times, but shows up 
			as an assignment. Also, they are from all 4 core subject areas. Much 
			of what you will do is listen/watch videos of instruction, then a 
			couple questions related to what you’ve watched. Please, with some 
			of the other time of the day, get about 15-20 minutes of some sort 
			of exercise or activity with your families. If students are super 
			motivated, they are most certainly able to complete as much as they 
			would like. Everyone will be at a different pace. This too, allows 
			flexibility within families, because as we all understand, life 
			happens.<br>
			This type of teaching/learning is very new to many, including me. 
			I’m sure there will be some difficulties along the way. I will be of 
			assistance in any way that I can. Parents, I too want to extent my 
			gratitude to you at this time, while you are trying to balance your 
			everyday life, while at the same time assisting your child with 
			their education. I have included my email as well as my phone number 
			if you need so I can try to help to the best of my ability. I will 
			check my email periodically and return suggestions ASAP. Again, 
			thank you for your patience.<br><br>

			WHAT TO EXPECT!!!<br>
			6th and 8th grade Math<br>
			I have created a website that will allow you to have a guided 
			schedule throughout the remainder of the school year. This schedule 
			will be updated every two weeks with the new material. Students are 
			to spend NO MORE than 30 minutes daily on their math assignments 
			with a minimum time recommended of 15 minutes. Our math classes will 
			primarily be run using KAHN academy. We have used KAHN throughout 
			the year (more with 8th grade), so students should have a username 
			and password. If students do not remember their username and 
			password, they are able to create an account 
			at: https://www.khanacademy.org/<br>
			6th Grade Class Code: KNGPCN3U<br>
			8th Grade Class Code: 5FY6EX4T<br>
			On my website mrsigmath.weebly.com (which you can navigate to by 
			going to our Nordic website, click on staff directories, then click 
			on my name) you find the weekly lesson plans. This will give the 
			outline of the suggested schedule. I will update assignments on KAHN 
			and the website every two weeks to progress through the material. If 
			you have questions and/or concerns please feel free to email me at 
			gsiegler@go-nordics.com.<br>
			Stay Safe, Stay Healthy, Row The Boat, 143.<br><br><br><strong>Mrs. Lindholm </strong><br><br>
			First of all, let me start off by saying this is not something that 
			we ever thought would happen in our lifetime but it did. Now, we as 
			Nordics, need to pull through the next 7 weeks to get through 
			quarter four. I want to do the best job I can for my students and 
			there may be times of frustration and panic on both sides of the 
			computer. That’s okay, we will get through this and we will move on. 
			If parents need to contact me please send me an email at 
			vlindholm@go-nordics.com I will be checking my email daily. <br><br>
			Now that we have expectations from the state, we will be able to 
			progress effectively with some type of schedule for classes. It is 
			important for the parent and child to set up sometime of learning 
			schedule throughout the week. This will hopefully help both parent 
			and child obtain the learning goals for each class. <br><br><strong>English 9 and 10th grades</strong> will be focusing on 
			curriculum content for the 4th quarter. Our main reading will be the 
			Odyssey by the blind poet Homer. Students will be using the website 
			Epic to access their reading information on-line. Students who do 
			not have access to the internet will have their English textbook. 
			Parents will need to pick up their students required work at the 
			school’s scheduled time, if they can’t pick it off from the bus. 
			Students will also be focusing on writing through NoRedInk along 
			with grammar assignments. This program is to help students write 
			journals that are content specific with a focus on Common Core 
			writing skills. Students will be needing their access code for both 
			programs. They will be sent to students through their email or 
			Remind app. Students need to be checking their emails weekly for 
			English work and updates. English should be done at least 20-30 
			minutes a day which would be 100-150 minutes a week for the next 
			seven weeks. Students/parents can decide how they want to spread 
			these learning minutes throughout the week. <br><br><strong>English 11</strong> Since the SAT has been postponed to the 
			fall of 2020 it is important that students in 11th grade keep up 
			with their English reading, grammar, and writing skills. We will be 
			using Khan Academy for the next 7 weeks to make sure we do not lose 
			what we already know and to increase our knowledge on these key 
			elements for SAT testing. Juniors have been using Khan Academy this 
			past year so all juniors are familiar with this program. Khan 
			Academy has multiple videos, questions and practice tests for the 
			English portion of the SAT. Juniors should be on Khan Academy at 
			least 20-30 minutes a day which would be 100-150 minutes a week. 
			Students/parents can decide how they want to spread these learning 
			minutes throughout the week. Students will need to make sure they 
			have the access code that is connected to Mrs. Lindholm’s English 
			Classroom. Khan Academy keeps track of how much time a student 
			spends doing the assignments and reports back to the teacher how the 
			student did on specific elements. These skills are then reported to 
			Mrs. Lindholm so she knows what needs to be worked on when classes 
			resume in the fall. Students who do not have access to Khan Academy 
			will have packets sent home to them. <br><br><strong>Digital Imaging Students</strong> will be given weekly 
			photography and reading assignments for the next seven weeks. They 
			need to be checking their emails for their weekly assignments every 
			Monday. Students who do not have access to their email or internet 
			will have homework sent home to them. I also sent a Remind sign up 
			in your emails so students can send me their photos from their phone 
			to me. <br><br><strong>7th Grade Elective Students</strong> will be given bi-weekly 
			projects for the next seven weeks. Each project will focus on 
			learning new skills, recording their learning steps and submitting 
			final project. Students will be able to send me their project 
			assignments by email, Remind or journal. Students will need to check 
			their emails for the Remind sign up instructions. Students should be 
			spending at least 15-20 minutes a day on their projects. <br><br><strong>Mr. Murray’s MATH and EXPLORATORY</strong><br><br>
			Hello students and parents! I hope this letter finds you well. We 
			trudge on with learning however we can. It may not be as enjoyable 
			as being in the same room with your ageing, balding, and particular 
			math teacher but we’ll manage I think. Because the internet will be 
			our best means of connecting we will be using Khan Academy for the 
			remainder of the school year. Some students already have accounts 
			and are already part of my classes, but many of you aren’t. Below 
			are directions for students/parents to follow to create an account 
			on Khan Academy.</p>
			<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			For step 2 Mr. Murray’s specific class codes are as follow:<br><br>
			1st hr Geometry: SGC2G2D5<br><br>
			2nd hr Math 7: UTCZZXKX<br><br>
			3rd hr Algebra1: QCAKWVPT<br><br>
			4th hr PreCalc: YHPJ9R9D<br><br>
			5th hr Algebra 2: TNYD7T63<br><br>
			6th hr Explore 8: EVPA5KRP<br><br>
			For step 3, I would prefer that students use their school issued 
			(@go-nordics.com) email address. If issues arise with usernames and 
			passwords being forgotten, the school can help students regain 
			access (parents please email Mrs. Lindholm with student email 
			issues: vlindholm@go-nordics.com).<br><br>
			For step 4, please enter the grade you are currently in (8th grade 
			students in algebra 1 should still select 8th grade.) You have to 
			select a course to continue, so just pick the one that sounds most 
			like the class you’re joining (Exploratory 8 students can select 
			“computer animation”). I will assign work to students so the course 
			you select is mostly irrelevant.<br><br>
			Once your account is created, I can then assign work to you. We will 
			be starting on Monday April 13th, so the sooner you can join my 
			class the better. I’ll be checking my email and Khan Academy 
			accounts each morning of the school week to check in with all of you 
			and make sure you’re on track. It’s okay if you don’t work on math 
			every day, but pay attention to the assignment due dates.<br><br>
			For those of you who don’t have internet access, you’ll be receiving 
			correspondence from the school via mail.<br><br>
			Geometry students, for Quarter 3 your report card will say “I” for 
			incomplete. You need to create a tessellating tile, trace it on a 
			piece of paper and color it. You may use the one that you started in 
			class if you have it, or you may start over. What I need to see is a 
			picture of your tessellation, either with your signature in the 
			corner or with your wonderful face in the picture. Please send those 
			to my email and I can update your quarter 3 grades as I get them.<br><br>

			Dear Parents and Students,<br>
			Hope you are doing well!<br>
			Following is the format I will be following for my content area 
			classes: Economics, History, World History and Personal Finance<br>
			For each of the above I am setting up a curriculum to follow on Khan 
			Academy. Students will be notified/invited via email (go-nordics 
			account). Students will join the class and have access to the course 
			material.<br>
			I will assign material each week for students to work on. I will 
			check their progress regularly and be available to answer questions.<br>
			For students who do not have access to technology, I will assign 
			work from our textbook. We will be sending out our buses on Tuesday, 
			April 14, 2020 for their afternoon route so parents can pickup 
			textbooks at that time.<br><br>
			How to join your teacher’s Khan Academy class <br>
			1 Go to khanacademy.org/join <br>
			2 Enter your class code and press “Add”. Class code: (sent in email 
			to student)<br>
			3 If you don’t already have an account, press “Create a new 
			account”. Enter your date of birth, then sign up using Google, your 
			school email, or by creating a username. <br>
			4 Enter your grade and course. Now you’re ready to start learning!<br><br><strong>Personal Fitness/Physical Education</strong><br><br>
			For Personal Fitness I will be recommending workouts that are on 
			YouTube and/or send kids fitness task cards to complete. I will have 
			students log their workouts and send them to me, and also have them 
			send evidence of other workouts they have completed. ~Be Safe, T.

			Online Courses and Michigan Virtual High School<br>
			Students are expected to continue their online learning courses 
			through Michigan Virtual High School and Edmentum. Mrs. Jauquet and 
			Mrs. Jungwirth will continue to monitor student progress on student 
			courses through the remainder of the school year. If a student needs 
			an exam password or is having difficulties, they should reach out to 
			their online instructor first and then e-mail Mrs. Jauquet and Mrs. 
			Jungwirth. It is extremely important that we know if you are having 
			technical difficulties right away so we can help you get them fixed. 
			While there is a pacing guide, the virtual courses are self-paced so 
			students may complete courses ahead of schedule. Mrs. Jauquet’s 
			e-mail address is jauquet@go-nordics.com and Mrs. Jungwirth’s e-mail 
			is ajungwirth@go-nordics.com<br>

			<br>
			If senior students have scholarships at home, they should mail them 
			directly to the scholarship selection committee. Mrs. Jungwirth has 
			been and will continue to, use e-mail to communicate with students 
			about any changes regarding scholarship applications and deadlines. 
			Students should reach out to Mrs. Jungwirth if they need a 
			scholarship application e-mailed to them. If students are unsure 
			where to send the scholarships they should reach out to Mrs.

			within the next 2 weeks to select courses for scheduling. It is 
			important that students respond to this e-mail in order to get their 
			first choice of course they want. If students/parents have questions

			or email her to set up a time to talk over the phone.<br>

			An e-mail was sent out to all 10th and 11th grade students regarding 
			steps for dual enrollment. Registration is now open, so students 
			should start the registration process ASAP. Mrs. Jungwirth will set 
			up a Zoom meeting if there is interest to inform students and 
			parents of the dual enrollment process and classes that students 
			should consider taking. Please reach out to Mrs. Jungwirth through 
			e-mail if you are interested in attending a Zoom meeting and/or if

			<strong>Counseling Services</strong><br><br>
			Last week, as I was debating how I was going to get through the last 
			couple of months of school without students being in the building, I 
			allowed myself to have a day filled with sadness. I was sad imaging 
			not seeing my Nordic family every day and sad thinking about all 
			that we would miss out on as the year goes by. I was sad for my own 
			children and for your children. As I lay awake that night unable to 
			sleep, I was reminded of a canvas I have hanging in my office that 
			says: Grant me the SERENITY to accept the things I cannot change, 
			COURAGE to change the things I can, and the WISDOM to know the 
			difference. I took a deep breath, let go of the sadness, and 
			reminded myself that during this time of change and of uncertainty 
			it is even more important to focus on the things that we can control 
			and change.<br><br>
			With that being said, I know that this is a very challenging time 
			for everyone and I want you to know we are all here for you and your 
			family. There have been so many changes happening in the world and 
			in our children’s world and it is a lot to take in. Please know that 
			as the school counselor, I am here for you and so is the rest of our 
			Nordic staff. As a staff, I know that this situation has made all of 
			us have a greater appreciation for each other and for our students. 
			We terribly miss seeing your kids every day.<br><br>
			While we are not in school I am available to meet virtually or over 
			the phone with your child if they are struggling with any 
			emotional/mental health issues or if they have questions about 
			school or college and career counseling. Please contact me first 
			through e-mail and we can set up a date and time that works for both 
			us. If your child was meeting with a staff member from the ISD and 
			you feel like they need a check-in from that person, please call the 
			school and we can have the ISD staff member contact you. Even if 
			your child doesn’t seem to be struggling, but you feel like they 
			would benefit from a phone call or virtual meeting please reach out 
			to us! Not all students feel comfortable with me but they may have 
			another favorite teacher or staff member. If you contact me or Mrs. 
			Inglese, one of us will make sure that we have that staff member 
			reach out to your child.<br><br>
			Many of our students and adults are feeling extra stress and anxiety 
			so I have included some simple tips/techniques on the next page that 
			can be used to help. Our students learned some of the techniques 
			during our mental health awareness day at school. Getting daily 
			exercise by taking a walk is an easy way to reduce stress and 
			anxiety. I have also included some very simple mindfulness 
			practices, and different breathing techniques and you can find many 
			more by doing a quick Google search. I encourage you to practice the 
			techniques with your child and go through them together. During 
			times of change, it is important to acknowledge the many feelings 
			that come along with those changes and work through those feelings 
			together.<br><br>
			Even though we are all separated in the physical sense, it is 
			important that you and your children know that you are not alone. 
			Our Nordic staff is here for you. During this time, my hope is that 
			each of your families is able to use the extra time at home to grow 
			closer together and that it helps you find a greater appreciation 
			for life and for each other. Please reach out to me if you need 
			anything through e-mail at ajungwirth@go-nordics.com or by phone at 
			906-221-5446. In the meantime, your families are in my thoughts and 
			prayers every day. Row the boat Nordics!<br><br>

			<br><strong>North Dickinson Alumni Scholarship </strong><br><br>
			Abigail Reimer, a 2014 graduate of North Dickinson and a 2019 
			graduate of Northern Michigan University has decided to start an 
			alumni scholarship at North Dickinson. Abigail said the following 
			about why she is starting this scholarship:<br>
			 <br>
			“I want to pay it forward for all the scholarships I received as a 
			graduating high school student. Without the scholarships I received 
			I would not have been able to complete my goal of getting my 
			bachelor degree without any college debt. I feel the best way of 
			thanking the people who awarded me scholarships is to start one for 
			my high school alma mater.”<br>
			 <br>
			This year, Abigail is funding one scholarship for a 2020 graduate of 
			North Dickinson, but her hope is that other alumni will be inspired 
			by her generosity and consider donating to the scholarship fund. She 
			shared that her dream is to be able to award 3-4 scholarships each 
			year to Nordic graduates. If you are able to donate to the 
			scholarship fund, please contact Angie Jungwirth 
			at ajungwirth@go-nordics.com or call the school at 542-9281. Any 
			amount you are willing and able to donate is appreciated and no 
			amount is too small.  Checks should be made out to North Dickinson 
			Alumni Scholarship. Funds received will be deposited into the 
			scholarship account at school and will be used to help Abigail reach 
			her admirable goal of supporting as many North Dickinson students as 
			possible.<br><br></span></p>
